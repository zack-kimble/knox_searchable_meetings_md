| 0:01:02| We are quite an extraordinary group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| We don't always see things in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| We don't always approach issues in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| But we are so grateful for that spirit within us that makes us community and helps us to learn through our diversities and our differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=75)|
| 0:01:28| We pray that you will be with us always as we deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=88)|

| 0:01:50| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=110)|

| 0:02:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our August 11th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Any corrections, additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| I'd like to withdraw 11-I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Okay, 11-I is just so everybody knows that was the original motion to opt out on handguns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=169)|
| 0:03:01| The other issue that is still on the agenda is 12-A, the ordinance to amend so as to delete the provisions prohibiting the use of firearms that was brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| I just want to make certain everybody, that item is still going to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| It was just the original motion to opt out or the original move to opt out that Mr. Becker is moving to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| 11-I is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Okay, any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| I would like to ask for a postponement of item 12-A, which is the item having to do with guns in parks, so that council can have a workshop on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=215)|
| 0:03:44| I had a family medical emergency and was not here two weeks when council considered not having the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| and I think folks are now that this is back on our table, I think this is an issue that folks are very, very passionate about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| and I think it's important to hear from as many people as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| I also would like to be able to consider, in the form of a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| a more surgical approach that might consider prohibiting guns where there are ball fields or children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| but allowing guns in some other parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| I think there's a number of options that we could look at, all or none, or something in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| So I would like to propose a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| I guess I don't know the length because I'm not sure, Vice Mayor Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| if this would pass what our options are for a workshop in terms of available dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| I'll start with a four-week postponement and put that out there for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| The motion and second is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| That's 12-A, which is the ordinance dealing with deleting the city code prohibition against the possession of firearms or weapons in city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=281)|
| 0:04:52| So that's the motion. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Discussion on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Well, I don't necessarily have any opposition to having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| I'd just like for it to be done in a timely manner because there's a very large group of people here, I'm sure, that are in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=301)|
| 0:05:13| But I do think that it is an issue that needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| There are, just for Council's information, there are eight folks signed up to speak on this issue tonight, just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Other comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| I'm going to take lights to be discussion on this item for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I did second this because I do believe that, as before, that we need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| We need to have the forum for dialogue and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| And I think there's a lot of facts and information and statistics that need to be discussed and talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| So I think that's, I appreciate Councilman Roddy's, some of her remarks, and I look forward to scheduling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| I think I saw Councilman Frost next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| I'm not sure, but if you'll go next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| It's hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Is Joe Walsh here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Joe is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Well, as you approach, let me ask Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Part of a workshop is for presentations by city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| Which city departments do you anticipate making presentations, and which have you checked with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| I have not checked with any city departments before tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Obviously, the idea of a postponement was pending on Council's agreement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| I do think Mr. Walsh from Parks and Recreation would want to make a presentation at that forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| I would also want to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| And as I said, I'm interested in exploring perhaps a middle ground that's not before us in this resolution tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| in terms of looking at our parks differently, where there are children and ball fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| and then some of our more urban parks, for lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Mr. Walsh, are you interested in a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I mean, I've read your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| I'd be glad to attend a workshop if Council so schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| We've got a lot of people here that want to talk about this issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| I do not mind voting on this issue tonight, letting the people talk about it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| I'm in favor of the postponement for the reasons that Councilman Roddy outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| that we need to have a conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| But I did also want to note that I thought we had a kind of gentleman's agreement to wait to see what the state would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| that it was clear to us that they were going to close the loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| and that we were going to wait to hear what they had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| And that's why Councilman Becker withdrew his resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| So I may have missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Councilman Hall, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| That's news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| There was discussion at the last Council meeting that the state legislature was going to take this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| But who knows if that will actually happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Yeah, I don't know that that's necessarily a foregone conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| And just for the record, there are a lot of people here, and I'd like everybody that's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| just to talk about this issue, which side you are on it or not, to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Because it is an issue that's of great deal of importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| and there are a lot of people here, and it is an issue that has been highly debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| So I don't really have any problem with voting on it tonight and letting the people speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Okay, Ms. Pelo, and then I'll go to Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| Well, I'm totally not expecting Ms. Roddy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| And I just want to comment that your plans were made, not plans but arrangements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| had you being away for a time without any expectation of missing an important Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=541)|
| 0:09:12| The week that I believe you all would probably recommend for a workshop, I will not be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| And I want to say that now because I think it has a great deal to do with it is the off-Council week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| and it's the week where we have no Council meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| And I feel if we're going to need to all be here, we need to all be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| And I want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Personally, I have no problem discussing this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| It has absorbed basically three-quarters at least of yesterday and today to respond to everyone who has been in contact with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=581)|
| 0:09:53| I personally commit to doing that, and I don't mean to complain about it, but I mean it has absorbed a great deal of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| I have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| This is, I believe, an ordinance, so it's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| And so I have no problem voting on it, then working in a workshop where we can all be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| And then that was the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| I also agree with Councilwoman Woodhull that it was my understanding that we were delaying a decision other than to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=614)|
| 0:10:25| as the city is under the present ordinance until after the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| because it was my clear understanding that there would be some legislative changes in what is before us to really consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=629)|
| 0:10:40| and we wouldn't want to consider it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I don't know that that's true, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| I don't know that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| How did we ever get that impression?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| A rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| A rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Oh, that doesn't happen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| I've talked to legislators that I've talked to some that have heard something about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| and I've talked to some that have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| And the ones that I have talked to about closing a loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| they're talking about closing a loophole to allow cities to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| So I don't know that anything we do would really have any effect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| I think Steve's probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| First, Mr. Swanson, I have a sunshine law question for you on sort of operations of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| We are obviously not allowed to communicate with each other between meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| So we get situations like this, we know a couple of them, where something gets on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| people on council want to actually postpone it, but lots of folks show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| Can you talk to us about how we are allowed to communicate in any fashion to say we would like to postpone this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| in a way that we don't have lots of people showing up to speak on an issue that we want to take more time to talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Is there a way to do that legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Well, the most recent opinion we have with regard to the sunshine law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| and what is covered by the sunshine law and what is not covered by the sunshine law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| is Chancellor Fansler's opinion from the Knox County case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| In that case, Chancellor Fansler did indicate that scheduling issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| just strictly scheduling issues, would not be something that would be covered by the sunshine law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| so long as you did not discuss any item of substance related to what was being scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| So just pure scheduling could be something that would be outside of the sunshine law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| but that's such a dangerous, slippery slope for you all to get involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| When you start communicating with one another, it's so tempting to start talking about substantive issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| that I have always urged you to exercise caution with the degree to which you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| But technically, under Chancellor Fansler's opinion, assuming he is correct on the law, and I believe that he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| the scheduling itself would not be something that would be covered by the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| All right, so there potentially are ways to avoid this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| but it's a very slippery slope and something we should be cautious of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| It's a good one to think about for the future on issues like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| and my sense would be if I was thinking about something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| it would be to call you, Mr. Swanson, and say, on this issue, what should I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| And maybe in the future to suggest to council members that we do a little more of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| because I get very concerned, as Mr. Frost does, about people who have come tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| expecting a discussion to happen and then postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| But I'm also willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| It seems like the question of when we can meet again is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Ms. Pelow has talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| I see the next three workshop dates, according to my calendar, Ms. Mitchell, are all available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Those are September 3rd, which is the Thursday before Labor Day, September 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| which I assume today, Ms. Pelow, you will be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| And October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I don't know if we want to – if this feels like the kind of issue that I would not feel comfortable voting to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| with some necklace, we'll get back to it at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| So I'm hoping people here can say, yes, we have set a date to consider to have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=845)|
| 0:14:15| Actually, I would like to see us do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| So you'd like to see what happens tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| If that is going to be considered, and we're probably getting ready to vote on whether to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| to have a workshop, I would like that date established tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Prior to your vote, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Right now, I think I heard Ms. Pelow say she couldn't do the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| So this isn't committing anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Obviously, you still can vote to postpone or not, but it's a September 3rd workshop clear for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| I ideally cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Yeah, I can make the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Well, I cannot make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Well, I would like to not make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| What about the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| What about October 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| That would push us to how much would you like to not make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| People don't like it when I – this is a marital thing, and people generally say I give too much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| So I'll just pass on answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| And if it's scheduled, I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And then the backup plan would be October 1st if Mr. Becker decides not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| So September 3rd or October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| I know I can commit to September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I don't carry a calendar with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| I don't know anything beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| I did check September 3rd before leaving the office today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Mr. Becker, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Then we are ready to – the motion is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Right now, there's a – everybody except maybe Mr. Becker can be here on the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Ms. Pelow can't be here on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| And it sounds like right now, from what folks know, the October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| The motion is to postpone until that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Do you want to include the date on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Because October 1st is probably – it's good with everybody so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| Why not just do it October 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Counsel, you'll –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| I don't know if I'm good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Well, you know, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| I talked about this earlier that, you know, we shouldn't be working around each other's schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| So if we're going to try to accommodate one and, you know, we have an intangible on another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| I'd say we go for October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| And if you can show up, show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| If not, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I mean, I appreciate that, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| But, you know, we as a council have said, you know, every other Thursday is a workshop night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| And if we schedule it that night, I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| So – and it sounds like that's the smart way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| I'll vote no because I don't want to be there, but I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Right now, then, I think we're going to vote on having – if it's postponed, the workshop would be September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| If it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Now, you still have to vote, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| But everybody wanted to know that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| The motion was actually to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| So the motion would have to be amended to postpone until September 3rd, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| No, that's just a workshop day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| It would be to postpone for four weeks and have the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| I could make it for six weeks in case we end up with October 3rd being the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Why don't I make it six weeks, and if we can hear it sooner, we can hear it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| I mean, can I make it six weeks, and then, Mr. Swanson, if the workshop is scheduled in time to hear it sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| may it be heard sooner, or is a six-week postponement a date certain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| A six-week date is a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| You could put it back on an agenda to reset the time for it to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| For example, at the next council meeting two weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| you could put it on the agenda for the purpose of setting a new date for it if you desire to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| I think it's probably cleaner to do four weeks, and then if for some reason we need to go two weeks more, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| My motion will stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| So the motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| The assumption here, the working assumption is a September 3rd workshop if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| All those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| I better do a roll call real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| I heard six ayes and three noes, so it is postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| That's the item 12A that eight or nine folks had signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| So there will be a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| How will we publicize it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Right now we're saying the workshop is September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| It goes on the city's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| We also send it out to the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Hopefully we can get a story on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| And the workshops are at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Five o'clock in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Well, I would just appreciate making a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| I voted no simply because you're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| And you've come out to be heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| And that is beginning to frustrate me terribly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I mentioned that in the last two council meetings about our postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| They really do impose difficulties on people who make it a point to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| And that was my reason for voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| I'm not opposed to the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| I initially voted for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| But I sort of think we need to fish or cut bait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| And we seem to be changing our position constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| That disturbs me very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| And I appreciate the opportunity to explain my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| I guess we're still on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| That item, though, is, just for clarification, everybody, is postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Consent items on your calendar are 11J, as in Joe, through 11N, as in no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Questions or comments on the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Real quickly on mayor's report, three or four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| First of all, if I could get everybody's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| If you're walking out, if you could maybe remember we're still meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| If I could get everybody's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| This is actually something that's real important to me, and I do want to get everyone's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| You all heard the announcement this past week that Chief Key is retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| and that Stan Sharp has been appointed to take his place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Stan is here tonight and looks forward to working with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| I'll introduce Stan, but I'll do that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I really wanted to talk about Chief Key for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Whenever you hire somebody to a critical position, you place a lot of trust in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| and you work with them in ways that you hadn't before that they're in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| So you learn a lot about them that you thought you maybe knew beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| but you hope to find out is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| And everything that I hope to be true about a person's character is true in Chief Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| He is a man who always starts with a question, what's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| instead of what's the political answer or what's the best for me, but what's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| And I think because of that, we have a fire department that has always been good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| and I think it's continued to be one of the top ones in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| but strictly because of the character and the dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Several of you have asked me, well, did something happen to Chief Key?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| The real truth to that, you know, this seemed to be all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| the truth is that Chief Key actually came to me several months ago and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| I've already filed for the drop plan, but I have some health issues in my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| and I would like to leave earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| And I begged him to stay for another month or two until we could take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| And he graciously agreed to do that, even though personally it would have helped him to move on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| So I am very grateful, Chief Key, for the way you've led our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| for the way that you've worked, and your answer has always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| what's the best thing for the city of Knoxville and what's the right thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| And there's really nothing else that you can ask of a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| So we're deeply grateful for the way you've served us, and the fire department will miss you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| and all of us will miss you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1357)|
| 0:22:53| If you know Chief Key, you know there's nothing he hates worse than having the spotlight on himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| and he's been counting the seconds until that was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| It is a privilege to introduce Chief Stan Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| who we'll probably formally swear in either at the next council meeting or at a date soon thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| and we'll obviously let everybody know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| And I think you will all really enjoy working with Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| He's a man of competence and character as well and commitment to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| and I know that you'll look forward to work with him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| So, Stan, congratulations, and we look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| One other brief thing in Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| I'd like to introduce Janice Greer, who's the Tenassee Council Board Chair for the Girl Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| and Lucille Griffo, who's the Tenassee CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| I think they're both here with us, and I think Ms. Greer has a couple, maybe some brief remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you very much for the opportunity to recognize some of our young ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| for achieving the highest honor in Girl Scouting, which is the Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| These young ladies not only exemplify the things that we try to build in young ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| as far as character, confidence, and courage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| but these young ladies are also a valued asset to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| so we thank you very much for recognizing them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Would you like to introduce them to us, and then I have some certificates to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1451)|
| 0:24:39| Emily Hoyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| Kelly Sellers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| And Stephanie Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1494)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| While they're finishing the picture, Dave Hill, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| has an announcement of a good little prize he brought back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Today, Governor Bredesen announced some enhancement grant awards that go to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| It's Federal Highways money that is administered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| and one of the projects that we applied for was Phase I for the Knoxville Shoals Riverwalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| which is a section of floating riverwalk that would be in the water in front of the former Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| So for that project, we received this check for $534,000-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1549)|
| 0:26:03| Just to give a sense of where we're going with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| this now brings us over the $9 million mark in terms of total grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| for different projects for the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| so hopefully we'll follow through, and the devil is always in the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| and trying to get the design completed, but it's good news to get from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Okay, we're going to move on to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| One thing, first, I'd like to thank a couple individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| As folks know, the Cat List Service has been, you know, somewhat controversial lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| and council has fought to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| try to find a way to serve as many disabled members of our community as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Yesterday I got an e-mail from Lillian Birch at the Disability Resource Center with a question about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| and I'd like to compliment and thank both Cindy McGinnis and Sam Anderson for hopping on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| and also like to say I found out this afternoon that Chris Woodhull also was involved in a meeting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| where an amicable resolution has been reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and folks are apparently now satisfied with the ability of CAT to give services to those with different abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1633)|
| 0:27:24| so I'd like to thank those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Three quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I just want to highlight for everybody that there's going to be a forum for potential new city council members this Thursday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| in this room at 7 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| and if you're watching at home it's actually going to be on cable TV starting 8 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| so that will be going on from 8 until 9.30 if you're watching a chance to find out about who might be sitting in these seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| down the road a little piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Wanted to do a quick update for city council members on a potential workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| that I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to send an e-mail out about on the downtown wayfinding project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| Anne Johnson, Anne Wallace, I'm sorry, Anne Wallace asked me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| My first reaction was I don't know that we need a workshop on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and I talked to her for a little while and was convinced that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| but I wanted to give everybody a heads up that an e-mail will go out suggesting some dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| and if folks want to follow up with Ms. Wallace and figure out what the issues are, that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| And lastly, I wanted to take a second on a new 202 law that's come down from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| Apparently there's a new law out there, and some of how we do this is going to make it a little more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Hopefully at a workshop at some point we can take five minutes and go over this in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| It affects those entities that are not 501c3s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| and it actually requires those to be published in a newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| actually printed in there before we put them on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| So there's some time and information issues that might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Before we get any more chance to talk about it, if you've got a 202 and it seems slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| know that it's the state's fault, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| My understanding is a while ago, but I think we're going to start following it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1750)|
| 0:29:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I just want to comment on something that tragically happened in our community, I believe, last Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| And, of course, we're all aware of the tragedy at the West High School basketball game, I mean football game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| and the impact that's had on the students and on the fans who were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| I've talked to a number of people who happened to be attending the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| and I saw the little news report where one of the young men who played football for West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1788)|
| 0:29:59| and I'm sorry I don't have his name, but I so want to commend him for the beautiful spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| in which he described the West High School team's response and reaction to that tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| I just want to congratulate those young people who were involved in expressing their condolences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| on the part of the West High School, and, of course, that goes for the Knox County School System as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| to those young people and those families from Dobbins-Vinon High and Kingsport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| because I think that represents the very finest in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| And it occurred to me, Mayor Haslam, I almost talked with you about bringing him here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| because such a beautiful expression of sympathy and concern and how that had impacted the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1847)|
| 0:30:56| So it's so sad, but so often we grow so much through very difficult experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| and I trust that what happened on Friday evening is going to be a wonderful growth experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| for many young people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Thanks for letting me comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=1873)|

| 0:34:04| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Well, there were comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| There was a question about that just prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| and I think it, who, I don't know who I should call on to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| Actually, Russ Jensen is the one who spearheaded this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| and I'm afraid he came last week, but I'm not, I don't see Russ here this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| I gave my best effort explaining it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| but I was hoping that someone could make a better explanation than I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Is there, in terms of the question, Larry, do you know the details of any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| I know it's a grant information software system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I know that we're funding part of it, and the county is funding a piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| and it allows, it will be housed at United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| and it will allow folks to better apply for grants through that software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| and I wish I could give you more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I think that is what I attempted to convey, and I just hope that I was correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| but that's my understanding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| It's going to benefit, actually benefit many agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| That's right, and basically the city and county together are splitting the funding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Councilman Hulkos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| This is direct support for United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| and United Way normally has a different way of raising funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| Has the city historically supported United Way directly before like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| I just don't remember one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| Well, it's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Not in my memory, but that doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Because, you know, they've got a very different kind of funding model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| They don't normally come to us for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| No, and this is not, this is basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| they're going to be the administering agency rather than this is going to fund the United Way programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| This is not going to their agencies that they fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| They're just going to be the place that's housed so that folks can use that to apply from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| So who all is going to be using the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I think any non-profit that wants access to it will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Any non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| It's not just their agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| It's not just their agencies, the agencies they support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| But you're not sure if any non-profit will have access or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Or how that will be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| It's my understanding that any 501c3, but, right, it was, you can't call yourself a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| You actually have to receive 501c3 status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| But if you have the exemption letter from the IRS, then you'll have access to this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| If you're in Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| That is definitely my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| And I'm about 99.99% sure I'm right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| So they're just managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| 10A is an appeal by clinic and housing LP of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| for multi-dwelling apartments in an O1 office medical and related services district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Property located on the east side of Maryville Pike, north side of Flanagan Avenue, in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| with 11H, which is a resolution approving the appeal of Flanagan Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| It's in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| I want to go ahead and make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| There's a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Is there discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Really, that's fine to make a motion, but my greater preference is to hear the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| the pros and cons, so council can consider what's before council before making a reasoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| That was my intent in making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I'd like to go ahead and hear everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| So you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| There are three folks lined up to speak in favor and three to line up to speak against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| and so we will go ahead and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| In favor of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| This is a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Oh, I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you for the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| You have to flip it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| I don't really think procedurally you can flip it that way because the appellant has a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| in these appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| The appellant has the right to be heard first and to have rebuttal testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Regardless, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Regardless, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| So, actually, a negative motion should never be made, but we typically do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| But under Robert's Rules of Order, you're not really supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| It should only be a positive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| But we generally do negative motions, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| But because of the way this comes up, the appellant really has the right to put on their case first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| because they have the burden of proof, you see, in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| The appellant does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| And so, you hear the appellant first, and then you hear those opposed to the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and then the appellant has the rebuttal of two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| That's why he went to law school and I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Mr. Swanson, while you're doing this, this is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Does it take five affirmative votes to adopt the appeal, or is it a majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| It takes five affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Let me ask Councilman Holquist this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| If you've heard what our attorney advised us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| would you consider withdrawing your motion to an appropriate time that we've heard things that we can consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2352)|
| 0:39:25| I'm not sure if it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| I don't think it really matters one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| When the time for voting comes around, if you want your motion to deny to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| If your motion to deny fails, then we would have to have a second vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| So just knowing that ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| If it were a motion to approve and it failed, you wouldn't need to have a second vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| So right now, the motion on the floor is to deny, but Mr. Swanson said the appellant still has the right to present first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| I think then the first speaker is Reagan Shriver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| And if every speaker, I'll just say at the beginning, would give us your name and address, and then you can take off from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| Well, I guess you're probably maybe thinking, a guy dressed like that, are we going to be stuck hearing a sermon or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| But I think I might leave that to Councilwoman Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| She did such a good job with the prayer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| My name is actually Reagan Shriver, and my address is 620 Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| I live there at All Saints Church because I'm a Catholic priest, and I'm also the executive director of Catholic Charities of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| I come to you today not because of being a preacher or not going to make you hear a sermon or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| because my role here tonight is past chairman of the Homeless Coalition, a community of people from this Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| that have advocated for a change in the way that we work with people who are homeless and people that are struggling in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| We introduced a plan, a 10-year plan, to try to end chronic homelessness within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| So now I'm lucky to have the role of being the chair of the 10-year plan advisory council advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| and I'm also a professor at the College of Social Work here at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Also, I'm really honored to be able to run a program as a part of Catholic Charities of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| that is a supportive housing program somewhat similar to the one that we're proposing for for the Flinnegan Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| It's located out in West Knoxville off of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Let me just tell you about three people that I kind of wanted to put before you today as a thought or some ideas as you consider your vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| And the three people are Moses, a guy named Marvin, and Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| First of all, Moses. If you think about Moses, if you've read about him in the Hebrew Bible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| Moses went to the Pharaoh, and he did not ask him to donate funding to sponsor a golf tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| He said, I need you to change the structure. I need you to change the way that things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| And because of his voice speaking out for the people that were enslaved, people's lives were made different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| They were able to go on and to make a life for themselves and to create a new community, in fact, a new country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| That's what we, members of the people that are representing the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| and even our friends that are homeless themselves are coming before you today to ask you to change the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| to please not just focus on an individual or focus on just some little bitty thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| but to focus on the fact that we need to change the way that we work with people that are homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| and that are suffering because of chronic homelessness. We need a system change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| The second person I'd like to tell you about is this guy named Marvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| My office, the directorship office of Catholic Charities of East Tennessee is located in a facility that is a supportive housing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| like I said, out off Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| That place where my office is is right next to another guy, Marvin, who has been homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| He's an 82-year-old man. He's spent at least 15 years of his life as a homeless person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| living under a bridge, living in a place that was unsuitable for human habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And one day I walked past his room and he was in there with his head down crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And I said, man, what's wrong? What's the matter? I thought things were going pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And he said, I'm just overwhelmed by the fact that I did not know that I could be loved like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| by the community of people that I've been able to come together with through my living situation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| And I started thinking about that. 82 years old, his whole life, he didn't know that he could be loved until that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| It was an unbelievable revelation to me that people feel marginalized if they're on the street, if they're homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| that they don't recognize that they truly are the center point of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| I think a community truly can be defined by how we reach out to the people that are the most vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| and the people that are struggling the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| That guy is a representation of what we could do to invite people to be a part of the centrality of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| The third person I wanted to kind of reflect on is Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| He was in prison and a group of ministers came to him and said, you've got to slow this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| The civil rights movement's got to slow down. You're moving too fast. It's going to be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| He said, no, we've got to move forward. We've got to go ahead with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| And I think about that in relationship to this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| As important as the civil rights movement was, it's just as important right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| There are people living on the street in unbelievable situations right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| And we have the capability to be able to bring people under a roof, to have a place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| to have a place that they can take their medication to help with their disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| We've got to be able to do that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| We cannot wait another second to fully implement this plan, this 10-year plan to end homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| and the suffering in the way that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| So I just want to say that we are all called to play a good Samaritan on life's roadside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| But that will only be an initial act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| We must be about transformation of the whole Jericho road so that men and women in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| will not be beaten down and robbed as they make their journey through life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| True compassion is much more than flinging a coin to a beggar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| It understands that a system which produces and permits people to be beggars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| to live on the street, to not have a place to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| when we have the full capacity to bring this suffering to an end, needs serious restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| I ask you for your vote tonight in support of the Flinnegan Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| so that you all and us together tonight can make a significant step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| toward a systemic restructuring of compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Please be a part of this restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| I'm Ginny Weatherstone with the Volunteer Ministry Center, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| In 1992, the Volunteer Ministry Center received a federal grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| to provide a subsidy for 16 apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| which we constructed on the third floor of our old building at Jackson Avenue in Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| They were considered the first steps out of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| In those early days, we did not marry the provision of the apartment with any social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| and I will be honest to tell you that turnover was high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| While there was a live-in manager, he was not awake during the overnight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| As we became better educated about best practices across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| and as we discovered for ourselves what works, we experimented with a different model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| First of all, the way to get into one of our apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| is to already be working with a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| We then wrote into the Jackson Avenue rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| that involvement with a case manager is part of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| While this is not the way that many permanent supportive housing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| across the country are operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| mandatory case management is the way that we run ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| With our successful transition to permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| and in coordination with the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| VMC stepped up to become the primary provider of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| We use not only the Jackson apartments, but scattered sites, KCDC facilities as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| and we have learned that it is easier and more effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| to provide individuals with supportive services when they are living in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Some will live there long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Many will move out to more independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| We are passionate believers in permanent supportive housing for one reason only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| The old model of emphasizing emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| did not actually help many people out of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| It may actually have maintained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| We've reversed that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| For the past two years, we have placed approximately 75 people per year into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| Every single one of these individuals has had a case manager who has followed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| helped them acclimate to a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| While we are proud of the number of people who move into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| 12 in this past July alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| we cannot look upon that placement as a success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| until that individual has maintained the housing for a minimum of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| The national average for such success is 80 to 85%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| and I am proud to tell you that the Volunteer Ministry Center's success rate is 88%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| Again, I tell you that permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| There are particular characteristics which VMC looks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| as it considers whether or not to provide service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| for a permanent supportive housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| For example, we look to have interior hallways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| so that residents will pass by the support service providers on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| We look for ample space for 24-hour awake staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| and adequate office space for case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| We look for the potential for a community room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Residents will enjoy a variety of activities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| and as well, that area can be made available for use by outside groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| All of these physical factors will exist in Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| The role of VMC at Flinnegan will be to provide the supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| There will be 24-hour awake staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| who have access to case managers during the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| We find this preferable to a live-in staff member who will need to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| These staff members will be trained as all VMC staff members are trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| There will be two case managers who will work full-time and will office at Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| They will have several opportunities daily to interact with their clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| in addition to a more formalized schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Case loads will be held to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| This is possible in a development of 48 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Low case loads and a real opportunity to build a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Indeed, best practices tell us that this is the optimal size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| Some people object to permanent supportive living developments in their area out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| They believe that crime will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| In fact, KP statistics indicate that police calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| to permanent supportive housing developments are fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| than to other subsidized apartments in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| There are, in this room tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| 10 residents of the kind of permanent supportive housing that we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| My guess is that you cannot tell them apart from anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| As they have moved into permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| they have sought the same things that we all seek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| a safe environment and a friendly one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Local businesses where they can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Local stores where they can shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Nearby friends in a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| And I would challenge all of us to identify just what is so scary about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| Permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Research states this is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| National best practices indicate this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| And our own experience proved this beyond a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| Good evening, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| I'm David Arning with Southeastern Housing Foundation at 901 East Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| Here on behalf of Flinnegan Housing Limited Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| applicant and appellant in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| As I hope you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| our appeal was filed on the grounds that MPC's decision was inconsistent with the city's zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| and adopted plans and was contrary to staff's recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Despite specific direction from its legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| MPC offered no rationale for its decision other than to reference the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| which, again, recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| The fact is MPC's decision was improperly based on the neighborhood's stereotypical fears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| and prejudices about the disabled population proposed at this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| The proposal was consistent with zoning precedent recently established on the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| Five years ago, MPC and city council approved on the same site a down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| and use on review to develop 42 units of subsidized housing for the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| Neighborhood representatives acknowledged at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| that they did not oppose the elderly housing project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| and they have tried to explain this inconsistent position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| by stating that the neighborhood was not aware of the project at the time it was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| and further, if it were proposed now, that they would, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| oppose it on the grounds that it is yet more low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| I find it ironic, frankly, that many of the residents in opposition to our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| are themselves residents of this very same subsidized public housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| MPC did not consult during the meeting with staff members who reviewed the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| and recommended it for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| And Mr. Donaldson is here tonight on behalf of MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| and I hope you will owe yourself to his expertise and reference on the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| Nor does it appear that MPC even considered the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| that was submitted as part of our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| MPC further disregarded the national and local data that you heard Jenny reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| recommending the proven effectiveness of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| in preventing and ending chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| saving local taxpayer dollars, and contributing positively to the revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| and property values of disinvested communities and abandoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Flinnegan was not chosen by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Flinnegan offers an ideal site for permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| because of its design characteristics and its proximity to health care, social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| shopping, and employment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| It also offers the unique opportunity to develop community space in the gymnasium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| that can be used by residents and neighbors alike as part of our reintegration effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| We have successfully secured $6 million in funding dedicated specifically to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| and redevelopment of the school will transform this longstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| vacant and severely blighted property into an architectural and a financial asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| using significant private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Lastly, and most importantly for our purposes here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| the proposed use is entirely consistent with the city's planning documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| zoning ordinances, and all other applicable criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| But this isn't about zoning, and it's never been about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| If it were, we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| As one of the NPC commissioners said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| if we were just talking about an apartment complex, this application would have been on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| But we're not talking about just an apartment complex, and we're not on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| We're talking about permanent supportive housing for the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| And here we are over one year into the rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| appealing an unjust decision that effectively discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| against a protected class of disabled individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| I've spoken tonight and at several public meetings about the technical and legal reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| why permanent supportive housing is appropriate at Flinnegan School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| Now I want to speak somewhat more broadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| because tonight's vote is about a lot more than Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| It's bigger than Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| It's more than the dollars and cents, the bricks and mortars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| the redevelopment of a single property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| Let's not lose sight of the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| The leadership in this community recognized years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| that chronic homelessness was a serious social and economic problem with immediate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Our leaders came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| They learned about the issues and the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| They studied best practices, and they committed themselves to a proven solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| that benefits not only our most vulnerable neighbors, but also the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| The solution is permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| It's proven nationally and locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| I recognize the difficult position you're in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| But you have to ask yourself who you're going to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Are you going to listen to some of the neighbors who oppose this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| because of their stereotypical and unfounded fears about the homeless population we serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| Or are you going to listen to community leaders and service providers who know this population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| who know this housing, and know that it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| Many of those professionals are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| I ask you not to bow to their fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| For one thing, the law says you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| Twenty more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| If you think that it's going to be any different with any other project that we try to do in the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| I think you are seriously mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| And if you allow MPC's decision to stand tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| you're sending the message loud and clear that in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| if neighborhoods fight hard enough, they get to choose who lives next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| And I don't think that's the community we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| And this is the order I have, but you can go in any order you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| Ron Emery, Monty Stanley, and Oren Mulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3436)|
| 0:57:28| Mr. Emery is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| But it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| We already got three speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Ron, if you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| I'm Ron Emery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| My address is 401 Forge Haven Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| And first of all, I'd like to congratulate Dave Hill for that big check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| That's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Does that mean we get a trial at Emory 510?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Only if you'll cash that check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| All we're asking for is a user right for O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| And I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| We approach this from economic development of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| And we have, believe it or not, I'm hearing the downtown, this, downtown, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| We started downtown south about 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| And we've been attempting to help that area grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| We've had a store in that area since 1957.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| And what happened, that was the day when the route to the mountains was on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| It was booming then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| When the estate was built, it took traffic off and hurt the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| And then things kind of dropped from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| And it's very fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| And, you know, David Arnie at the MTC meetings did say it's depressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| And he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And there's a conversation about this being a positive thing for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Well, maybe today, but not ten years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| And let me tell you what I see in South Knoxville, what the potential is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| I'm not sure how many have been up to Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| It's a 90-acre park the city owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| It's gorgeous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| It's got a crystal clear quarry down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| And I've already talked to this part of my vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| I've talked to Sue Hamilton at the trial gardens at UT, the botanical gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| And I asked them if they would help us develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| And what I would like to see is Knoxville being identified as a city of gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| And it could happen because there are famous gardens around the world that people go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| And I think we have that potential right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| I can see Fort Dickerson has been a tremendous catalyst for that area to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| And once it starts growing, then we're going to need this area, this land, for our own commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| And we'd rather not take it out of our inventory and keep it for when we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| But, as I said, I'm going to repeat myself again is, yeah, today, yes, it may improve that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| But it won't in ten years because we were – and it was booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| And you're talking about an area five minutes from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| I mean, 20 years from now, if it develops, people are going to say, why didn't I think of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| It will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| And also, you know, if you do develop Fort Dickerson, I can see trolleys going up there and taking city workers for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| And I can be really, really positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| That whole area could be tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| But we need a catalyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| And I think leaving that O-1, the use of right for O-1, trying to get my wording right to make sure no one gets confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3639)|
| 1:00:49| I would just rather leave that commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| And I think for the long term, you'll see benefits and a higher tax base in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Mr. Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| I live at 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Allowing the use zone review for O-1 designation for the Plymouth Publican School would be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| Within the last two years, several new businesses have relocated to the Martinville Park area in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| Buildings which were dilapidated at one time have been restored to commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| Todd Green Agency, Labor Management Support, Construction Solutions, LLC, are all new to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3691)|
| 1:01:40| And each of them cited the close proximity to downtown as well as the Vestal revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| and the future waterfront development as reasons they chose to locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| To take Plymouth property from the equation would prove to be short-sighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| and would take a potential valuable revenue-producing source for the city off the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you for your support of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Warren Mulrick, and if I said that wrong, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3733)|
| 1:02:27| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| My name is Warren Mudrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| You were close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I live on 206 Flanagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Before I speak, I'd like to go ahead and ask the people that are here that remain for the 01 zoning for no variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3756)|
| 1:02:45| for the right for 01 to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3765)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| I live right across the street from the school building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| And as far as the actual structure, there's a lot of work that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| The walls are cracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| The windows have been busted out within just all around the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3790)|
| 1:03:18| A lot of it's just fenced up and has been sitting for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| Also, too, is the businesses that are within close proximity of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| You've got several within several just blocks, Martin Mill Pike, and also the easy access to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3810)|
| 1:03:40| Also makes it a very good idea place for business opportunity for doctors and lawyers to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| A lot of ideas have been circulated on trying to improve South Knoxville by revitalizing downtown Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| which is within short proximity of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| And also to help revitalize South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| This would be a great addition to that, I think, and just helping to add on to that to offer jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| And also, too, it would be a great opportunity, I think, to help the homeless to be able to offer jobs by having this in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3851)|
| 1:04:21| by having businesses or doctors' offices or lawyers' offices move into this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| And, again, I'm for the use of the ride for the 01 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Thank you, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| That is all the folks that we have to sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Oh, yes, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| I'll learn the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| I've just been here six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| If you give me a few more, I'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Two minutes rebuttal for the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Just a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| I should have done this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| If I could ask those who are here in support of the Flinnegan Permanent Supportive Housing Project to stand up and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| South Knox has made it clear that they have a vision for their community, and that's admirable, and we share that vision with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| There is a fundamental disagreement of how we view the effect of this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| and we truly believe that it can have a very effective and positive impact on the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| and we believe that because we've looked at other examples across the country, not far from here in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| where rehabilitations like this of affordable housing have actually stimulated the neighborhood revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3932)|
| 1:05:44| And I guess the last point, and we're happy to answer your questions about the specific design plan, the use, the program, and the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| We're all here prepared to answer your questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| But I want to remind you that we're not here to choose the highest and best use or a potential use for this school 10 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| You have a specific application before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| and we even now have not been given a single reason by MPC or anyone else of why our proposal doesn't satisfy approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3967)|
| 1:06:18| And I don't know how else to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| If we're talking about any other multifamily property here, we're not having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| I don't think, unfortunately, unless council would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Mr. Becker has recognized you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| All those that are still here, I'd like to see how many work for Southeastern Housing or volunteer for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| Stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| I know more of you work for them than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Well, they're involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Well, most of them are involved in some way with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| That is all before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Any discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Is Ms. Rojero here this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| She is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| She is sick today, and I apologize, but she, I think, has the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| I guess I'll ask Mr. Martin this question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| Mr. Martin, one of the things that the city is committed to is an investment in the redevelopment of downtown Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| through Empowerment Zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| And my question is, will the proposed use of this property in any way threaten the city's commitment to invest in redevelopment of downtown Vestal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4055)|
| 1:07:44| Council Member Roddy, no, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| And is the intent that this investment in downtown Vestal will leverage or incentivize other private investment in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| We certainly hope that it would and that it would contribute to the redevelopment of the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| So as we're talking about the need for economic development in South Knoxville and particularly in the Vestal area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4082)|
| 1:08:10| we have a city commitment to some redevelopment in the traditional downtown Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| and the addition of a multifamily situation on this property you would see as not threatening that redevelopment in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4095)|
| 1:08:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Mike, you've heard the description of the Flanagan School building today, the condition that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| We think this would be a positive investment and as was cited, could be a catalyst to other development as it has been the case in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4117)|
| 1:08:47| I have another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| There's been some discussion among this council, particularly when we addressed the budget last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4130)|
| 1:08:59| And that is with the proposed use of this property, this use for multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| do you think it's going to constitute a future unfunded mandate for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| In other words, is this a commitment that we can afford long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| Well, I think that's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| It's a fair question and it's a difficult question because the whole situation is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| We need to find a solution to the chronic homelessness that we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| And it is a cost to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| It may not show up on specific line items in your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| but it will show up both in cost with our police department and cost with our fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| It will show up not in city budgets but in county activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| I heard the Sheriff Jones talk about it and the significance of the cost that we spend today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| So, yes, we have got to figure out the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| It is a matter of shifting where we are spending significant dollars today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| and spend them in a more productive way that leads toward ending the issue of chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| as opposed to what we do today, which just takes care of the symptoms of it, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| and not the core issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| And that's what this would be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| May I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| And I guess this is for Mr. Arning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| And this is a related question in terms of the future funding mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| that future councils will have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| The funding model that's proposed for this multifamily use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| how long is the commitment for that to play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Is it 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I'm not sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| The commitment to an affordability period, it would be 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Twenty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| And after that 20-year period, you have the option to apply to THDA to be released from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| And I'm not aware of THDA ever denying a release of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Twenty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| That's all for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Mr. Mayor and Council, I was a member of the Tennessee State Legislature for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| And fortunately, I had the Tennessee Constitution by my side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| And I'd like to read for you Article 2, Section 13 of the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4283)|
| 1:11:33| Senators and representatives shall in all cases except treason, felony, or breach of the peace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| be privileged from arrest during the session of the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| and in going to and returning from the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| And for any speech or debate in either house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| they shall not be questioned at any other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| I don't feel I have a right to talk about what's on my mind with the issue before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| And so I just want to wish the Constitution protected me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| I just had a couple of questions that have been posed to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| And I just want to ask for the record and for my own edification and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| Mr. Arning, I guess, would be the best person to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Now, are you going to develop the whole building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| I know you're going to even add a floor, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| But you are going to develop the entire building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Yes, to the first part and no to the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| We're not adding a floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| We would look to remove the 1955 cafeteria addition off the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| and replace that with a single-story addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| So it's not too big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| The property itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| How long has the building been empty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Or maybe somebody else can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| I think the Knox County School System abandoned it in the mid-'90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| And then there was a business that came in which rezoned half the property, I think, around 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| So over ten years as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| George Lemon was in there for a while with the football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| What percentage do you know offhand what percentages of the program are from out of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| In terms of our homeless population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| I'm probably not the best person to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| I can answer that quickly and simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| and tell you most of them are from Knoxville and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| What do you say to those that say the city shouldn't accept the total burden of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| that if we do this, that this basically is a mecca for recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| and if we'll house them, the residents will come here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Well, I'm definitely not the best person to answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| but I can tell you the ten-year plan is all about accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| And anyone who has been a part of the process to develop that plan and implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| has seen the changes that have been made with the various service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| ending the duplication, requiring accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| and moving folks forward on a sustainable path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| And you have personnel there 24 hours a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| That we would at Flinnegan, yes, 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Well, I think folks have spoken to both sides of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| and I'm not sure if I can add much to what's been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| but I just wanted to make sure that council understands why I made the motion that I did to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4481)|
| 1:14:50| When the property came up for rezoning, part of it was zoned commercial, part of it was zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| and split zoning often doesn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| I felt at the time that for a lot of different reasons that we couldn't support the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| but I think the folks in the community, especially Mr. Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| has spoken tonight and said that they think that there's a lot of potential in the not distant future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| for this to serve the community best under office use by right as it's presently zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| And I think I tend to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Alternate use of housing may or may not end up being viable over the long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| but if you look at the proximity to Chapman Highway and what we're trying to accomplish there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4537)|
| 1:15:48| it hasn't been easy to move things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| We have the Chapman Highway Corridor Study, which myself and former county commissioner Larry Clark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| took the initiative on in getting that started with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| That was two executive directors ago, before Mr. Donaldson, before Mr. Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| trying to begin to lay the groundwork for the future of that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| And the idea is to redevelop it over time as a vibrant mixed-use development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4573)|
| 1:16:25| In order to get there, we have to have those foundational investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| And the question is, what's going to be the best investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| Will it be sort of a hodgepodge of housing and other uses, or will it be focused on where we want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4593)|
| 1:16:44| Will professional offices and office use get us there more effectively than what's on the table now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| I suspect it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Other council members may not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| But I am hopeful that council will agree with the motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| and give us the opportunity to forge the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4625)|
| 1:17:14| I guess that's really all I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| First, I wanted to recognize David Arning's father in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| I don't know if that's going to help or hurt him too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| But Nick is thankful he serves our community on the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| I definitely heard loud and clear David Arning's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| However, this council is keenly aware of other rezoning and use-on-reduce situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| which have been denied before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| I can think of some that have occurred in the district I represent, as well as other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| What I did when coming to the conclusion that I reached was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| First, I'd like to say I'd appreciate being given the opportunity to tour by those in the immediate vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| and those in the service who are kind enough to provide this type of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| There's a third type of tour I want to talk about in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| But when I looked at what's before us and what is germane for this discussion, as usual, I pulled out the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4695)|
| 1:18:25| I looked at the zoning for office and what's allowed in office, which are there's some uses as of rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| which mean you have the appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| And without public input, without public review, you can automatically do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| And in office zoning, like in all other types of zoning, there are use-on-review applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| which can be heard, which can be considered, and which can be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| That happens whether it's in office, whether it's in residential, any type of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Almost all have uses-on-reviews that are allowed and that are subject to review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| That's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| But the tour that really stood out to me was the tour I took of both the former Perkins School site off of Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4748)|
| 1:19:19| and the former Tyson Junior High School not far from here, just down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| If you want to look at two schools that were dramatically changed for the better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| I remember going through Tyson Junior High one year when it was literally used as a haunted house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| and they didn't have to do much to get it in that shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| And I'm being serious for once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| But we've got the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| You know, I'm an old house guy, an old house person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| I can look past issues and see, you know, good bones and potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| The potential I see when you stand out there at Flinnican and you can look down on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| and the businesses that are in the vicinity is another Perkins or another Tyson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| And there's great potential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I just want to explain myself, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| We've looked at this for the last 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| and I'm one that was very leery of this supporting housing concept in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| And I've listened and I've looked at the history of supportive housing in Portland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| And I took ownership of this plan about 14 or 15 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| And as I look at this zoning issue, you know, I don't think I'm familiar with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4847)|
| 1:20:57| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| The owner has tried to market that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| He's been unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| It's basically falling down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| It's blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| I don't know if there's ever been a drawing shown as to what this building will look like when it's landscaped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| and when it's renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| I look at the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| The money's raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| It's a proven product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| These residents make good neighbors where this has happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| It has the right support and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| And every time we have a zoning, it's controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| There's opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| And so this is no different to anything else we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| And I bought into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| I think I thought we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| And if we say no here, what happens to the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| And where else do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| So it's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| I look at these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| I met with them last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| And I've always said this before, that I would never put anything anywhere that I wouldn't want next to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| And this holds true here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| I think there's a lot of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| And I think that in the long run that it's going to be a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| And I think the city as a whole needs to embrace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| The MP staff recommended to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| And I'm going to take a position and support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Councilwoman Phelan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Well, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| I think the tours have been really very eye-opening and affirming to me of what I had hoped could be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4954)|
| 1:22:44| I took a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Actually, it was a totally different type location than Mr. Frost is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| My tour was to a purely residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| And I had a wonderful visit with one of the tenants there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| And, in fact, we had a long visit because she was a delightful woman who shared a great deal of her life experience with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| And the thing that I found so interesting was that I really couldn't find where I was supposed to be going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| although I had already made a dry run, as somebody mentioned earlier, to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| But it was so well incorporated into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| And then I discovered that everyone lives as neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| And I was so highly impressed with the supportive aspect of it, how independent those who live there feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5019)|
| 1:23:50| how enabled they feel to live an independent life and to make the most of what God gives each of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| a little bit different slant on what life's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And this was a young woman who had lived in that location for 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| A highly inspiring and impressive visit with her and how it had enriched her life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5047)|
| 1:24:16| and how she felt that she had enriched the life of the community around her and how everyone was just neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| I have to say I've made several site visits, two specific ones recently, to the Flinnegan site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| It's so discouraging to me to see such a magnificent building in such dreadful repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| Actually, it's blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I just feel bringing that building back to life as it once was can bring life back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| and hope back to the residents of the area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| Because I just think we all tend to do well when there's good things going on around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| And I have every confidence that the 10-year plan is something that we all need to learn to embrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5102)|
| 1:25:13| You know, it's a leap of faith when we make any change in zoning in any area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| And I do think there is so much benefit that can come to our community as a result of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| and not to mention the lives of those who will be enriched by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| Frankly, I cannot see a zoning for commercial or office use there because to me it's a little community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5131)|
| 1:25:43| It's a little neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| And neighborhoods build on commercial and office development and other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| But that is now a residential area, and I just see so much hope for the area as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| for everyone to join hands and live together as we all should and can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| And I feel that revitalizing that building is going to be really the life's blood that that area needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5165)|
| 1:26:14| That's my personal sense of what's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| And for many of the same reasons that Councilman Bailey just stated, I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| I felt a little bit like Councilman Booker about what I'm allowed to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| and I also feel very angry about this whole discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| I thought for a while I wouldn't say anything at all because that was probably smarter than it might well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| But Father Shriver always has a way of sort of bringing out a good thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| and I kept dwelling, Father, in some of what you said about the story of the Good Samaritan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| and how that applies here, and partly it's sort of where my anger comes down in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| I mean, the story of the Good Samaritan, I think it's a pivotal one for my faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| We sort of get stuck in a challenge now where this vote is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| is are we going to leave that person in the ditch or is the Good Samaritan going to help them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| And we don't think enough about the tax collector and the priest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Right now the Good Samaritans in South Knoxville are dealing a whole lot with getting people out of ditches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| and the unfortunate part about this vote is the only option we've got is are we going to get somebody out of a ditch or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| and we're not doing near enough talking about who all is involved in getting those people out of the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| I would love to vote to not vote in favor of this appeal, but I feel like I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| because the only other option is to leave people in a ditch, and that doesn't help anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| Okay, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| Okay, Ms. Mitchell, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| And this is on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| I'm sorry, thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| Ms. Roddy, is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Okay, excuse me before you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| You know, Mr. Bailey talked about taking ownership of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| and I think Vice Mayor Becker talked a little bit about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| And, you know, I think this is an issue that was put on city and county's plates without our asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5289)|
| 1:28:19| You know, 25 years ago the state of Tennessee addressed this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| and because of funding issues, funding decisions that were made at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| it was given to cities and counties to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| And, you know, I think in a compassionate democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| it's our obligation to care for people that can't care for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| And whether those are orphans or developmentally disabled or mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| or any other group of people that need help and that need a safety net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| in a compassionate democracy, it is our burden and our privilege to care for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| And, you know, the state of Tennessee was in charge of this, but now we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| And I think the plan that we have come up with as a community is the best possible plan that we could embrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5352)|
| 1:29:22| Mr. Bailey talked about taking ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| It's not an easy thing to take ownership of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| but I think it's something that we need to share across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| We've made a huge commitment with Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| and I know the folks all across the city very much went back to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| I think this is something that needs success and needs to be embraced everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| As a community, we've got to support and do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| by people who need our help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| And I think that permanent supportive housing, as some of our speakers addressed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| is the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| And I think we've got to go with the right answer for the people that need our help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5408)|
| 1:30:22| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| I appreciate the comments of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| It's a difficult decision, as others have pointed out, a difficult vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| But I think the challenge for all of us is to be responsive in a way that we're not seen as insular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5432)|
| 1:30:45| making decisions on what happens in communities that we don't live in that impact the lives of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5445)|
| 1:30:55| And whether for better or worse, it impacts the people in those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| And if the people in those communities, whether the outcome proves to be good or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| if their perception is that they were not involved in that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5468)|
| 1:31:16| and they have been chosen for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| Some may believe they've been chosen because they live in a community that seems to have less political power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| less economic power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| If that's the perception, whether it proves to be reality in the long run or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| can leave a very uncomfortable set of conditions if a decision is made in a way that it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5498)|
| 1:31:49| that the decision-makers are insular in their decision-making position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| In other words, if they're making a decision on something that does not impact the community that they live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| but does impact the community that others live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| then that can create a very bitter taste in some people's mouths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| And I think I'm reading the way this vote is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| And so the question is, if that's the way the vote's going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| how are we going to deal with the residual effect and the resentment and bitterness that will exist in that community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| And how are we going to heal that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| When you have organizations that are well-meaning organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| with a wonderful program that needs to be implemented across the community, in all parts of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| and yet we're not seeing that happen yet at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| and we're seeing certain communities who are used to being picked first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5564)|
| 1:32:54| how are we going to move beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I do know that we've got a big question to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| And if we don't try to answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| neither the 10-year program or anything else we do in this city is going to go as well as it could if we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5586)|
| 1:33:15| I think that's enough said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Mr. Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Thanks. Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| I certainly don't have all the answers at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| But sometimes experience is something that speaks to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| And I was involved in a situation probably, I don't know, maybe time flies, doesn't it, 12 or 15, maybe even 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5622)|
| 1:33:54| which was going to impact the neighborhood I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| And there was extreme opposition to what was about to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5638)|
| 1:34:07| And there was a huge amount of concern because the property, which was in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5647)|
| 1:34:16| was immediately adjacent to Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| And there were going to be no fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| There was going to be absolutely no separation whatsoever of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| And it was a very prominent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| It had been given for use, for a particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| It was to be a home for very disturbed young women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| And very naturally, the neighborhood I live in, which gets a little bit of a tizzy about even small things, was in a big tizzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5681)|
| 1:34:52| And it was not something we had a great deal of ability to stop or to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5692)|
| 1:35:03| And there was a lot of talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| And there was a lot of negativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| And guess what? That happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| It is there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| That property has never been anything that most people would even consider to be a part of a detention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5715)|
| 1:35:30| There was supervision. It's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| Not as large, but pretty large for one which had been a private home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| I have to tell you, I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| I've watched what's happened in the Bearden area, which has been an amazing surprise to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5741)|
| 1:35:49| how the community has rallied around those people who need many supportive services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| both the business community and I've spoken to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| So I have been astounded at the inclusion, if you will, at the celebration of diversity and differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5761)|
| 1:36:11| that has actually achieved such success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| Frankly, that is what I envision for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| It truly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| And the reason I envision that is because I have a lot of faith in people, in their goodness, in their understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5784)|
| 1:36:34| And I have a great deal of faith in this program because I think all our eyes are upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| They are looking to provide housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| I do not believe that you will see anything change on that piece of property for many years, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5806)|
| 1:36:57| And it troubles me that the neighborhood will continue to decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| The neighborhood that was declining in that Bearden area is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| My goodness, I can't believe how it's taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| But the important thing is nobody wants to give up the opportunity for it to be a place for handicapped people with wheelchairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5828)|
| 1:37:16| who have sight problems, who have many other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| because there they can find the supportive services they need, the bus lines that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| all the amenities that give them the opportunity to live a life that we take for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| And we take it for granted because we can be independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| And to offer independence and support and love is just, I think, like Ms. Roddy said, I think it's just our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5856)|
| 1:37:48| And it should be our privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| Now, that is not an answer to how you heal, but I think it's an answer to how we can approach situations like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5870)|
| 1:37:59| which can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And I'm sure that we are going to be a part of how we possibly can help to heal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5881)|
| 1:38:08| And I realize it's something that troubles you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Thanks, Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| I guess, Mr. Horowitz, I think you asked a brilliant question a minute or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| You know, what do we do now on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| And I guess at one level, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| we can challenge the administration to look at some of what they did back when we were dealing with Menville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| And I think they took some very proactive steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| But I also want to suggest, again, that the nine of us sit down and talk some more about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| in some places that we feel like we can talk more openly about both how we heal some of the bad feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| that's going to be created by this, but also how we do make this system work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| I don't feel good about what's happening tonight at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| And I think we can do a whole lot better on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| So I might want to suggest at some point we do a workshop on the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| And I know I suggested that before and it hadn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| But I think we need to keep working on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Let me just interject for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Then I'll come to you, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| For those of you who wonder if there's some code being talked about here tonight by Councilman Booker's comments and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5951)|
| 1:39:20| there is a Fair Housing Act that is a federal law that guides what can and can't be discussed when you're talking about housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5960)|
| 1:39:28| And so I think there's a certain amount of frustration on everybody's part that we'd love to have a discussion on another level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| And I think I don't want anybody to think, well, what are they talking about up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| But I think there's an elephant in the room and that's it, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| And I think we're all mindful of, you know, federal law is what federal law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| And it's there for a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| But that's what's being spoken of but not spoken about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| So I just wanted to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| Well, I appreciate both Councilman Pelos and Councilman Becker's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| Going back to Councilman Pelos' comments about the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| I think that the people that are here from South Knoxville would not trade their area for Bearden for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| It's precious, it's unique, and it's special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| But I think many of them would trade, if they could, the problems that they have for the problems that the Bearden area has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6017)|
| 1:40:31| We're talking apples and oranges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| Bearden area is an incredibly financially and economically dynamic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| There is no comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Well, I shouldn't say there's no comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| We've got a lot going for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| But it's a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Bearden has had the last three, four, or five decades of tremendous economic growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| and it's been part of a big economic growth engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| It's been a very declining area, very declining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Let's stay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| I didn't realize I was going to be interrupted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| But it's a point well made, but it's a very different environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| I think everyone knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Everyone understands what Bearden is about, and everyone understands the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| or I hope everyone understands the issues we're struggling with in the Vestal area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| So that said, going back to Councilman Becker's comments, thank you for responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6088)|
| 1:41:37| I would say that, again, there are lots of good, well-intentioned people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| that are staffing all these organizations that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| and the board members and board chairs, good folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| And I would challenge you all as people who are part of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6110)|
| 1:41:59| when you go home to where you live, whether it's in West Knoxville or Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| because I've gotten e-mails from people supporting this project in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| that are board chairs or former board chairs, and I appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| But when you go home to those areas that aren't affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| I would hope that you would find a way to engage in this healing dialogue also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| because we need you not to just say we want this to happen in your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| it's a good thing, bye, we're going home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| We need you all to engage on the long term so we can find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| Mr. Chair, I'm not ignoring you, but by our rules, we let three speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| and three speak against, and we're past that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| I hate to sit here and ignore you, but that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Well, there are a couple of things that have been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| May I recognize Mr. Brown, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Thank you, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| I understand your position, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| but there's been some things that have been said here tonight that are not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| And I think that this body needs to be made aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| We in South Nashville are not against this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| But it's like apple pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Apple pie is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| But if you ate 48 pieces of it, it would make you sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| I mean, let's put it frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| And that's what we're being given, 48 pieces of apple pie all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| I think that if the truth be known, the studies on the successes of this program have been in smaller units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6211)|
| 1:43:39| They have not been in larger units like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| These folks have come to us on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| First, they told us there would be 24-hour a day persons on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| And then the last three meetings were, no, but they would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| Now we come here tonight, and from two different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| I hear that there's going to be a 24-hour a day person there for each 24 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| So we don't know what to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Ms. Roddy asked a question a while ago, how would this economically impact that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| And she asked, and I'm sorry, I'm terrible with names, but your answers were it's not going to affect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6252)|
| 1:44:20| How many of you all are in business for yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| Would you want to open a business where you knew there was already a situation like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| that was within a block or two blocks of where you were going to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Would you consider opening there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| I'd like to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| It does have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| We mentioned a while ago about it being a fragile area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| It is a very fragile area, but it's been coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| We've had a longer way to come than a lot of other areas in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| And I'm proud of what they've been able to do with the advent of the Waterfront Project and all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| the Legacy Parks Foundations, tying all these parks together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| We can't help but grow out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| And that's what we want to do is grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| We want to be able to have the chance to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| but not have something shoved down our throats and lies told to us about what's going to be happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| and what's not going to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Because at this point right now, after tonight, I don't know what's going to be happening out there if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| And I'm sorry, but I wanted to bring those things to your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| and I thank you very much for your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| Same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Somebody wants to – anyone recognize Ms. Weatherstone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| If not, we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Mr. Booker would like to – sorry, but we have rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| I had thought that I had made this clear earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| I wanted to make sure that everyone understood that the ratio of residents to case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| is one case manager for every 24 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| There will be 24-hour awake staff on the premises at all times, including weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| I also wanted to tell you that national best practices that we have studied, visited, and looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6376)|
| 1:46:24| specify in particular that this is the ideal size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| They recommend 48 to 55 as the ideal size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| And the statistics that come in for success are based on units of that or developments of that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6394)|
| 1:46:42| Ms. Weatherstone, 24-hour awake staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| So every night, while 48 people are sleeping, you're going to pay somebody to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| Well, I'm really tempted to respond because I'm familiar with what Helen Ross McNabb has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| with her new facility on Cox Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| And I did go see, as Father Reagan referenced, the Samaritan place with Catholic Social Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6427)|
| 1:47:15| But my sense is, at this point, there's no value in getting into this back-and-forth numbers game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| So I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| I would say that they're dramatically different, the successful ones that I'm aware of, in terms of scale and size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6443)|
| 1:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Ms. Mitchell, if you'd go ahead and call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| This is on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| It's been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Mr. Swan, sorry, you reminded me once, but I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| The motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| If everybody's clear on what that means, thank you for reminding me one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| The motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| It's a no, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Councilman Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I'm sure I cast an incorrect vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I'm totally confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| I think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| I think it's fine for you, at this point in time, to change your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| I'm voting with Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| If his is aye, then mine is aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090825?start=6512)|
