| 0:02:03| we thank you for everything you do for our children, families, and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| Board members, you received information by email yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| but I wanted to highlight publicly that Item 7C21 was added since the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| The Austin East Community Foundation has provided a generous donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| for the benefit of Austin East Magnet High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| and we wanted to get that approved as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| to enable the school to use those funds to stay signated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Also, as requested by Ms. Owen on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| additional documentation was provided for Item 7C2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| in the award bid 3208 to T&T Produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| The bid document as well as T&T's bid response are now attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| Are there any requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| So we have a motion to approve by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| So tonight we have a special recognition of our Train Light Switch Plate Design Contest winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| I'm happy to introduce Nancy McBee with Train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| to recognize some very deserving students as winners of the Train Light Switch Plate Design Contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=198)|
| 0:03:31| I'm Nancy McBee with Train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| and I have with me Zane Forecker, your Knox County Schools Energy Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| who is amazing, as I shared with Mr. Roswick just a minute ago, Dr. Roswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| and Heather Castile, who is over at the Art Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Train is your energy partner, and every few years we sponsor a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| well, actually, this is the third time we've sponsored a light switch sticker contest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and it's all about getting students to come up with a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| that helps people remember to turn the lights off when they leave the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| because the best way to save energy is to turn things off that use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| So we have three amazing winners, and I guess we'll – should we call them all up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=247)|

| 0:06:26| We're just going to step around over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=388)|

| 0:06:55| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=415)|
| 0:07:08| For the elementary level, Heather says that Iker is not here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| So I think his teacher is going to accept on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| If he's on his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Okay. Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Christy, you're in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| So when Iker gets here, we'll all come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=456)|

| 0:07:50| Thank you, Ms. McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| And we will come back to the elementary winner because I believe that student is on their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| and we don't want them to miss this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| So today is also designation day with Ford Next Generation Learning and Knoxville Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| Superintendent Thomas, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| This morning, we gathered to celebrate our district's designation as an official Ford Next Generation Learning community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| It was an exciting event and I'm grateful to have shared it with members of our school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs, Deputy to Knoxville Mayor Ken Cannon, Stephanie Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| Cheryl Carrier, Executive Director of Ford Next Generation Learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| and members of her team who are here with us this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| as well as KCS administration and staff, KCS students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| and representatives from businesses, post-secondary institutions, and community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| It was a huge crowd and a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Today, we recognize the work that has been done to reimagine our high schools through the 865 Academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| which I believe will provide our students with additional opportunities to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| At this time, I'll turn it over to Dr. Reiswick to talk more about the significance of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Before you speak, John, I just wanted to say thank you and your team for all the hard work that you put in this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| I know it's thank you to a lot of other people, but I'm not sure anybody said thank you to you today, so I wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Again, thank you for having the vision to allow us to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| It is a big day for us, a lot of work that went into this to build a master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| The master plan, I think the board members have a hard copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| and we'll be getting emailed out a digital copy of that later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| I think it really sets a roadmap for us as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and I think what's been so exciting for us is it's not just a Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| We've kept you guys apprised of that as we've been walking through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| It's not just a Knox County Schools initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| It really is something that's going to set the tone moving forward for our whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| The people that Mr. Thomas mentioned as far as the mayors, both mayors being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| there were commissioners there, there was you all, the school board there, a lot of business folks there, nonprofits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| I can't remember a time when we've had that kind of involvement in really asking people to not just attend an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| but be part of a process to really help us build out what the next five years can look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| We had four of those events or four of those meetings where, again, a lot of you all were able to attend those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| where we had folks in groups working on tactical teams kind of building out what it could look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| and had between 100 and 150 people at every one of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Students were also at those meetings, teachers, principals, and the schools that are working toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| So I really think, again, as we've talked about the process before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| it is exciting to think we have a roadmap to follow no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| No matter what principals may move seats, whatever, those kinds of things that happen, we have a place to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| And I think what's really exciting for us is I think some people think, well, this is just a career and tech ed thing for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| but this really doubles down on our commitment to have both advanced academics and robust CTE programs in every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| so that all students have a system in place for them from kind of sixth grade to twelfth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| where they'll be part of a career empowerment preparation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| And our goal is that when kids switch schools, that there's a system in place for all those schools that are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| and that our kids can leave kind of informed and ready to make decisions for what they do post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| And I think most importantly, we had a quick meeting, and I'm going to ask Cheryl Carrier to come up in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| but we had a meeting kind of after the meeting today, a quick little lunch and kind of talking through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| We all have agreed it's not just getting across the stage for graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| It's really are they ready to choose what they want to do once they leave and be successful in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| So super excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| I know Knox Ed Foundation has been a huge partner, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| and know the agenda item on today is to continue this work in the fourth phase of the implementation is one of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| So we appreciate them doing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| And I would like to ask Ms. Cheryl Carrier, if she would come forward, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| Executive Director for Next Generation Learning, to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Thanks for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Today was spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| It really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| I don't even know where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| You know when you come into a community if it's really a community, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| I mean, you feel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| And it was so obvious today that there were so many people in the room that cared so deeply about the children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| And your team is exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| I mean, they really have great depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| You can see that everybody really owns this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| And we're just thrilled that you're part of the Ford Next Generation Learning family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| And when I say that, I truly mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| We are a family of communities that have come together and learned from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| We are learning from you as we continue this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| You will be learning from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| And ultimately, they're going to be learning from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| So a couple things that really stood out to me was, you know, the depth of your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| And the fact that you had the amount of people in the community that were so committed that they showed up for every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| And you all know this is not an easy process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Writing this master plan is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| And if you can get through it and you can put together a good plan and you're all, you know, friends and family, I mean, you have won already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=810)|
| 0:13:40| But the hard part now is the implementation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| You've got to keep the foot on your gas and make sure that, you know, you're supporting the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| and the work that they want to do because they really want to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| And I believe that will grow over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| So that was one thing that really stood out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| The other thing that stood out to me was the fact that you brought the students in in a really authentic way to help develop the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=838)|
| 0:14:10| I mean, it's about them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| And how often, you know, do we ask them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| And to have them involved in a way that they're excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| They're sorry they're going to miss it, potentially, or they might just get a glimpse of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| But the fact that they're excited for their siblings to be part of the district is really remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| I've never seen a team pull together that many students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| So that was another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| And then finally, you know, just really getting back to the spirit of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| I go into places, and I know they're going to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| But this is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| You know, there are a lot of people that are on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| So I'm thrilled that you're part of the Ford family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| And Superintendent Thomas and Ryzwik, I feel incredible that you're leading this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=903)|
| 0:15:16| And thank you for getting it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| And we really look forward to sharing your successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| So stay in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| We'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| I hope to be back for your retreat when you're taking a look a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| How are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| And how did things go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| But our team will be with you the whole way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| So thank you, and welcome to the Ford NGL family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=943)|
| 0:15:54| So board members, we do have a couple of presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| One is to Knox Education Foundation for designation day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| And the other is to the Ford Next Generation Learning Team for this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| And I think we want the entire board to come forward with these individuals for a photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| Is that right, Ms. Herring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=975)|

| 0:22:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1336)|

| 0:22:37| Yeah, there are two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| So, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| That's all I was pointing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| So, do we have a motion to approve one over the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| That was Ms. Satterfield and Ms. Fabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1370)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| I know we discussed both options on Monday and it seemed like there was some agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| around option two in order to be able to make us a little bit, give us a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| opportunity to discuss the possibilities around officers prior to actually making that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| So, I would, I don't know if we're making a new motion, but I would make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| accept version two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| I think that's the correct one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I think we might need to just clarify which one it is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| That's, yes, version two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1420)|

| 0:23:57| and then some additional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Option one would just keep the same special called meeting for officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1440)|
| 0:24:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I moved a motion that we, I make a motion to, to accept version two for policy B-110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=1453)|

| 0:34:25| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I just want to say thank you to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| committee for working on this and for the administration for trying to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| creative and provide our teachers more opportunity not only for planning but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| for professional development, allowing our teachers to improve their craft, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| to be able to have time to do the things that they really want to do to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| to speak into the lives of students. I think I mentioned this on Monday that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| you know so many of us who work in different industries really value that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| time and teachers often just don't get that so I appreciate that. I'm gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| passing on this tonight not because I don't think it's something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| should do and that we need to continue to get creative to provide our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| opportunities for things like this but because I think the second most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| significant stakeholder group that is impacted by this we didn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| consult in the calculus of it. From my understanding we have limited if no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| engagement from parents or families in the potential impacts of this and and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| I think it's just important for us when we're making decisions at a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| system that's going to impact all 60,000 of our students and all the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| that are there that we end up engaging them in the process and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| discussion and that they're a part of that and I know for some families this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| will be just a bump in the road and it won't be any big deal but I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| there are also some families who this will be a major deal and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| it's just important to consult our families through those processes and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| think we have means to do that. We have the Family Advisory Council and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| types of mechanisms where we can have families speak into this type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| so again I'm not not supportive of these efforts like this. I want to see us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| continue to try to do more to give our teachers this type of time. I just also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| want to make sure that we're engaging families in the discussion and in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| kind of trying to fully understand the impacts that they may have and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| again also want to say thank you to our after-school programs and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| willingness to step in and help fill that gap that that would be impacted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| this but we also know that there's not after-school programs in every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| and not every kid has access to those so again really appreciate the work and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| energy put behind it. I just want to continue to spur us on as we make these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| decisions that are impacting all of our families that we engage them some in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| process of making the decision so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Okay so we have a motion by Miss Satterfield and a second by Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2210)|

| 0:38:07| have about this is is this an additional holiday or is this taking the place of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| different holiday? Superintendent? Thank you Madam Chair. No this is not taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| place of a holiday. It will just be a day off for employees. It will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| impact their salaries at all but this is something that of course President| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2302)|

| 0:38:45| against it at all I just wasn't sure if it was an additional or just switching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| of days. All right I believe Superintendent Thomas you said this kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| of puts us in line with what the county's now doing with with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2336)|

| 0:40:00| addressed to specific board members and there was some confusion in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2400)|

| 0:40:12| sent that email earlier in the year to the board about the Sixth Circuit ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| so if you could just speak to that just to make the community aware of how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| works. Okay thank you Madam Chair. So the the board has a public forum first I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2421)|

| 0:41:44| different terms and you know what's what's allowable under the First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Amendment and what's not so this board's policy has been tweaked slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| due to that case and I think the biggest question recently as you as you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| Madam Chair is around I mean what if you what if you talk about individuals okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| well that case talks about school officials and it's a person can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| school officials and and complaints about school officials but again those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| comments should be you know in some way related to education some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| professional manner and and those calm and those comments should be civil I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| mean it should not be a disruption should not be yelling and cursing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| things of that nature so so as long as speakers are civil they can name school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| officials because that's what the courts talked about but then again doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| that that it's that it's factual I mean it's somebody coming up and giving his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| or her opinion and we are a family-friendly organization so we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| that you keep your language clean and miss bad just for some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| because I do know sometimes we don't know how to react to public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| speakers and when you say that if they start calling out individuals say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| teachers things like that is that allowable in public forum I mean I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2592)|
| 0:43:22| say that the the Sixth Circuit opinions less clear on that it literally uses the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| term school officials school officials we would interpret to mean certainly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| board certainly higher school officials such as superintendent I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| would also include principals because principals are probably their most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| visible you know leader of that school teachers not as clear so I mean you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| one one could certainly say hey you know we don't want to go there you know at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| this point plus I'll also add this there's also another policy that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| talked about in the public forum policy that talks about be 171 is the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| policy that I'm talking about which talks about complaints and how they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| supposed to rise up through through the ranks so ostensibly if somebody is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| coming to public forum for the first time and hasn't brought it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| attention of any other school officials then then this board could certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| object on that basis sure because I mean I don't think as a board and just as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| public and as you said a family-friendly thing that we are wanting public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| to be used as a place to disparage people so thank you miss Ellen Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| You madam chair I would just like to point out that in our public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| policy I believe it's pretty clear that it shouldn't just be something that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| vaguely related to education but our first line says that it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| matters important to education and I think it's incumbent on all of us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| hold us to that all right mr. McMillan Thank You madam chair mr. law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2697)|
| 0:45:08| in light of what we were discussing here does the in your opinion does the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2708)|
| 0:45:18| if the speaker is getting off the subject or is out of order does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2718)|
| 0:45:30| speaker have the right to stop that I mean the the chair excuse me the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| have the right to stop that person from speaking and tell them basically they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| through so Thank You mr. McMillan I think the vice chair initially has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2743)|
| 0:45:52| the responsibility I yeah yeah you know it's coming you know it's coming so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| vice chair has the initial responsibility but but certainly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| chair could step in as well that they're the they're the two officers of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| board and you know my suggestion to to you two would be you know perhaps you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2765)|
| 0:46:13| know a warning and say hey you know let's get back on track or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| like that but but if things do get out of hand I mean you all do have the you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| know the power to say hey this is not in the bounds of of our public forum policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| okay wait can I speak okay and then I want to say that that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2786)|
| 0:46:35| information that I had previously when we did talk originally regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| Supreme Court case about what that meant because my understanding and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| could just been a misinterpretation was that we had to let people speak their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| full three minutes of the time because freedom of speech and so now that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| that understanding I'll be sure to speak up when things are not in the line well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| no that's a good point miss Satterfield I mean again I mean yeah I think people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| have that have that free speech right and just because something is offensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| okay so this is what it talks about in that case as well just because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| offensive doesn't mean that you can shut it down I mean it would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| literally some type of disruption again along the lines of yelling cursing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| know being being vulgar I mean you know something along those lines if it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| somebody up there civilly stating their his or her opinion just because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| don't like it or you don't like what they're saying about a about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| particular board member or principal or something like that doesn't mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| you can shut it down so let me be clear about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2861)|
| 0:47:51| miss Ellen did you have something else yes ma'am chair I would like to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| that the last time we changed this policy looking at make sure I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| at the right one at the public forum policy specifically in the changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| we most recently made in lines 34 and 35 we also have the remarks of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| individual can be terminated if they are disruptive degrading and or insulting so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| the the point of whether it's offensive or not I think would need to move over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2895)|
| 0:48:23| into whether it is specifically degrading okay thank you mr. Dupour with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2903)|
| 0:48:32| did you have anything else that okay all right mr. Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2912)|

| 0:49:32| because about three to four to five months ago I had I had lost someone due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| to suicide over what I believe to be a like school system of like just over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2979)|
| 0:49:47| over just overloading of distress and and the reason why I talked about teacher pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2987)|
| 0:49:59| is because he had specifically a teacher that that and that annoyed him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| to death and just the entire class and and I feel like increasing teacher pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=3005)|
| 0:50:13| could attract more nicer and and teachers as well as give teachers a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| reason to be nicer throughout the day and and yes that's almost all I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220504?start=3018)|
