| 0:08:54| or was it just an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| It was an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| We need a second on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| A second from Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| She said the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| You want to do the fine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| So the motion on the floor to do the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| See the clerk after the meeting, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Clerk, item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Maria D. Garcia, L. Ray, Aztec, 3515 West Emory Road for on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Matthew, you want to come and state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Maria Dolores Garcia, 3515 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I'd just like to know if I can get approved to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Chairman, isn't she the one that needed the variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Weren't you here last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| And since then you've gone to the Board of Zoning Appeals, which granted you a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| And that variance was for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| It was from 500 feet of an agricultural, that we were 500 feet or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| and we wanted to get it reduced to 300 feet, 350 feet, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| And it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| So it was reduced from 500 feet to 350 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Has anything else changed since the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Well, let me, just because I'm not exactly sure what we went through last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| let me go through some questioning of you again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| We'll have it for the record this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| or any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| This is a new establishment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| So beer has never been sold here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| So there's no outstanding license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| And this is for on-premise consumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Do you own the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Do you rent the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Does anyone else have an interest in the business other than you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| No, it's just propriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| How do you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| So propriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| And you're going to be the person operating the business, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| I went Thursday, but I was too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| So now I have to go back this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Mr. Chairman, they went before the Board of Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:15| They gave them a variance for agricultural property 500 foot down to 300 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=735)|
| 0:12:24| And I need still a clarification on a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| There's a daycare within 45 feet of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| What she had to do, what Mr. Minor is alluding to is the 500 foot zoning requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| and from an ag zone is basically what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| And what you've done, you've gone to BZA and received a variance from that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| And so right now, unless there are other impediments to your obtaining a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| you can satisfy that one based on what the Board of Zoning Appeals did at their last meeting based on that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:13| Any other problems, Mr. Minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| How about codes and the fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Let's go to Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| He's got his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| I'd like some clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| How does a variance down to 300 feet, if the original law said 500 feet and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| okay, we're going to give you a variance and knock it down to 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| how does that help if they're 45 feet away from a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| And for the purpose of a beer permit, I think the reason why we want alcohol not being served close to a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=827)|
| 0:13:57| is because of the danger of children loading and unloading in bus zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| And this parking lot with the restaurant is actually also a loading zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| In fact, if you look out there, you can see the little school bus that takes the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| I guess they pick them up at the elementary schools for their after-school program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| is right there in the same parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| And I'm wondering, how does a variance that goes from 500 feet to 300 feet help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| when they've got a preschool 45 feet away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| And it's nothing personal against this restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| They have excellent food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| I've eaten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| And they seem to be very fine folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| But my problem is if we open the door and open Pandora's box here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| are we going to have a bar next to every school in town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| You could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| A couple of things come into play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| One, we have a zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| which forbids on-premise permits within 500 feet of any agriculturally or residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| Now, what this applicant has done, she's gone to the Board of Zoning Appeals and received a variance from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| That is all we have in Knox County at this point in time to put a distance requirement on a beer permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:21| What you may be referring to, Commissioner, is in the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| a public entity may have a variance, well, may have a distance requirement, a restriction, basically, of up to 2,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:39| Knox County was, by order of the court in 1976, enjoined from enforcing that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| And we have not ever reinstituted that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| And so what we have is a 500-foot requirement from an agriculturally or residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| This question was before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| And the Board of Zoning Appeals chose to grant this person a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| And so at this point in time, as far as that requirement goes, this applicant has satisfied that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Commissioner Cate, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| He got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I don't know whose lap was on, yours or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Commissioner Bullis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| I just want some clarification here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| This business app is for 3515 on West Emory, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| And we're stating that's 45 feet roughly from the door of a school or a daycare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| I believe it's a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Is that the right address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| 3515, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Because there was some question earlier that I had from someone that we may have had the wrong address down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| But that's your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to make a motion that the application be denied should that daycare happen to move at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| And if you would like to come back to this Board, we'll be able to take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| I cannot vote to put that within 45 feet of a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| So I'm going to make a motion that the application be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And there's a second, Commissioner Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| I want to make a comment that with Commissioner Lambert, I did go out and visit the site, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| And he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| The back end is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| You take your deliveries right there at the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| And your entrance is 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| It's beside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| It's 45 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| And I'm concerned that the wrong address was given before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And, Kim, I don't know if codes or whatever, if you all had the wrong address before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| But they have had a wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| So there's been a first and a second nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| So what is the 300 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| What was that all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| It's 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| You've got a variance to lower it from 500 down to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| But she's, like, 45 feet away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| So she's still not within the bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| There's been a first and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| All in favor for the denial, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1090)|

| 0:18:20| Do you want to take Commissioner Hammond's advice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| You know, if that daycare was to happen to move out, then, yeah, that would be wide open for you to do at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1108)|

| 0:19:00| Ms. Salem, I'm going to go through a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| What I did with the last applicant, if you would please respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Has beer been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| Are you sure of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| They probably haven't had any beer sold since they've been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| but we took them lessons away from the former owner two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Were you aware of that, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| This is for the last owner, now with a new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Well, the question is, question was, has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| Maybe that's better stated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| So there's no outstanding license because the license was pulled, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| And this is an application for off-premise consumption only, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Do you own the premises, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| And does anyone else have an interest in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| We own the business from Kauffman Oil Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Kauffman Oil Company owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| And this is your business, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| So you all rent from Kauffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Kauffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| So no one doesn't have an interest in your business, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Do they have a legal interest in your business or is this just your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| They own the oil and the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:22| What's the name of your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Shell Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Do you own Shell Mart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Do you own it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Does anyone else other than yourself have an interest, a legal interest in Shell Mart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| Kauffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I don't think we're getting anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| What your application says is that the property owner is Kauffman Oil Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| and the business is Shell Mart and that you own the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| I don't see any other persons who have an interest in your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Is what you have stated on your application true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1326)|

| 0:22:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Who's going to operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Who's going to run your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Me and my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity and in compliance with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1356)|

| 0:22:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1372)|
| 0:23:06| February 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| February 2nd, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| February 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Do you have anything else you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| With that, you've understood my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| I'm basically going by what you've stated in your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| that, first of all, you own the business, you're the sole owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| and that Kauffman Oil Company owns the property and you rent or lease from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Health Department, do you have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| I'd just like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| You said her husband was going to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Is he part owner or is he going to work for you or how's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Because I don't have any information on your husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| He's going to teach me how to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| He's not going to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| The Sheriff's Department has no problem with the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I don't have any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| And Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| If this is approved today, ma'am, you will need to get a business license, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| It is with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| You have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| We're going to need a copy of it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| Mr. Bullis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| I just want to clarify one thing on this application, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Have any of the persons whose name appear above been convicted of any violation of liquor law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| or any crime involving moral turpitude within the last ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| It's probably just an oversight, but the question has not been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| On the application where it's usually answered, it's been left blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| It's probably just an oversight, but for clarification, I want to know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:34| Mr. Bullis, we have this copy was probably made before she totally completed her application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:44| Maybe she came in and then it was pointed out to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1544)|

| 0:26:51| My address is 980 East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Ms. Captain, I've got a series of questions to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| You've heard them a couple of times today, but I need to run through those, which is what the law requires of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:18| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| I had to look up that word, turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| What did you find?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Well, it meant all kind of bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1644)|

| 0:27:30| But I don't think we've been convicted of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Moral turpitude mostly involves dishonesty and deceit and fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| But it's a new word for me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1658)|

| 0:27:47| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1667)|

| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| So, there's no outstanding license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1684)|

| 0:28:17| And what about owning the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1697)|

| 0:28:23| And who do you rent from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1703)|

| 0:28:43| Does anyone else have an interest in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1723)|

| 0:32:23| Left of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| This is a brand-new building that they're building as part of that center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| So if your application is approved today, it would be pending the resolution of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| just to make sure that you are not within the 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Like the young lady that came a couple of times before us up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| can we go to the ordinance people and have that changed to so many 350 feet or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| Should it be not within 500 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| It's the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| and you would have every right to file a request for a waiver for a variance from that requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| and whether they grant it or not, that's up to the Board of Zoning Appeals if you're within that 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I just wanted to say I think he's already answered it, so I'm just going to make this a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| I move that we approve this pending the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| Question, Mr. Lauderdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| How soon will they know in this pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Will they know when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| How quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| I mean, there are several matters that are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I heard health department was pending, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| So this will be subject to all of that being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I believe there's some people in the audience that would like to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Anybody from the audience that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Rhonda Lyles, and I live on Holy Crest Lane right behind the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| As a resident of that street, there's children that are picked up at the end of that street from the school every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:42| and all the residents on that street are against having any more establishments, beer establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| It's just not, you know, just too many children on that street to be having more and more in that shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| It's just not, we just don't feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| There's too many kids on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Is that Holy Crest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| I don't know where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| It's within 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Anybody else like to address it from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| And I'll be happy to have more neighbors come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I just came today just to make sure that we made an opposition on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| Commissioner, go ahead and restate your motion for the group, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| Well, I mean, I think it's an issue for the Board of Zoning Appeals apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| and I was just going to say so these folks won't have to come up here several more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| I just thought that if we could approve it pending the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| then the neighbors can state their case to the BZA and take care of it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| One thing I will say is that Spicy's, and I'll confess I actually eat there about once a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| is a full-blown nightclub in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| We have problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Yeah, in the evening times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| So I guess the way I'm looking at it is the three or four beers a day that an Italian restaurant would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:17| wouldn't make much difference considering you already have a full-blown nightclub sports bar in the evenings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| Now, of course, I'll say I go in the early evenings and have their chicken wings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| but I understand it gets pretty crowded there later at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| The music is just terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| It really is, and we just don't want any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Yeah, yeah, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| But I think that's something more for the BZA to hear, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| Yeah, that's where you need to take your neighborhood people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| and that's where you all need to go to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| That's where you need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| And I will just say this from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Small Italian restaurants like this don't tend to have the kind of volume that a place like Spicy's has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| They generally will serve a couple of beers with dinner, and, you know, they just don't have the nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| But, I mean, yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| It's, you know, I've driven by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| The entire parking lot is taken up by Spicy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| Again, if you want to pursue this, I'd take it to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| but I don't anticipate these folks having the same sort of business that Spicy's does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Did we have a second on that, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| May I readdress, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Ma'am, I would like to say to you that I don't drink beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| I don't drink any kind of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| We debated about this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| I was told, I mean, my husband has had restaurants in the city of Knoxville, and my cousin has too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| and they've served beer for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| As a matter of fact, Johnny recognized some of it from what you eat down on the strip with him before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| but we're not in it for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| I'm not in competition with Spicy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| I understand if somebody eats a pizza, they might want a bottle of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| I mean, we've cut it so far back that we're not even going to have draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| and draft beer is what you make a little money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| I doubt we'll sell very much at all, and it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| it may not even be worth it for us to even get a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| but I'd like to be able to offer the community, and I know Mr. Lambert is our representative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| We want to offer the community a nice place to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| We're not a chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| We're local people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| We've made our living, you know, on food for a long, long time, and we're decent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| We are church-going people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| We may believe a little differently, but we're not there for drunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| We're not there for drunks at all, and that will not happen at our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| So if I can do anything to make this lady feel more comfortable, I'm a grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| I'm just thinking about the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| I just don't think we need any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Ladies, you all probably need to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Can you call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Can you call for the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| and clarify that that location is in Mr. Smith's and Mr. Moore's district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| Just barely outside of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| So you've got some fine folks representing you there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| There's been a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2388)|

| 0:39:53| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| The court made a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:07| Seven ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2407)|

| 0:40:11| I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| You announced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| And the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Madam Clerk, read the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Seven ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2417)|

| 0:40:44| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| We defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2445)|

| 0:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| We're on amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| You'll see the amendment is placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| I believe the amendment has been placed before every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| as well as to the clerk, the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| It is an amendment that begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Knox County Commission agrees to the following proposal for the county law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| to present to Jack McElroy, and I ask that it be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| If we have no objections, we'll add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Do we have any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Yes, we have a tolling agreement between the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| and us that we'll add if we have no objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Also, on page 16, Resolution 907 that I sponsored, I'm going to withdraw that this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:13| Mr. Chairman, I also ask that 903 be taken off consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:24| It's on page six, bottom of page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Commissioner Harmon, could you go back and tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I haven't had time to explain a little bit of this in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| During the intergovernmental meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| the law director led us through a very interesting and well-informed discussion about this pending legal matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| involving the Jack McElroy lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| This is, and there was a great discussion about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| and there was some concern about commissioners having to sort of admit to wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| and there was great concern also about trying to get the matter resolved in the interest of avoiding legal matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| cost, public confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And so this was my way of resolving those two by combining them in the effect of something like a consent agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| where commission admits to no wrong but does propose to the suing party, Jack McElroy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| a do-over in the following manner proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| So this is going to ask for a separate, another re-vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| It would if it were approved and presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| And we agreed with the negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| And, Mr. Chairman, that we had, I think, what number was that that you mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| Was it 1790?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| What number was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| 907 on page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Was that the Tyler Harbor deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Why does this keep coming up when that's not our job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Our job is not to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| You know, that's what the sheriff does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Our job is not to prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| That's what the attorney general does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| This is the third or fourth time this keeps coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| And, you know, guys, we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| This is not our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| 901 and 902, if we can move that up, that's dealing with the pension board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| So if we'll hear that right after we do our honoraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Do we have any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3107)|

| 0:58:44| I wanted to clarify which one it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3524)|

| 1:06:35| I know some of you are new on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| but I have worked with the majority of you in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| even though you are new to your county commission seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| I want to thank each of you for being willing to serve our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| and putting yourself forward and be willing to set your name out to sometimes be attacked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| either by pro or con, you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| But I do want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| And I thank all of you for the opportunity that I've had and the citizens of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| that I've had to be able to serve at the sheriff's office for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| When I first started, the sheriff's office had less than 100 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| We now have 1,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| And so it's changed tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| It's changed since I was elected in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| But the changes that we have seen, the things that we have seen come to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| and making us a full-service agency are due to the fact that we have great employees at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| And I certainly could not have done that without those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| and them being willing to be professional and serve this community as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| I do want to commend again each of you for taking your seats as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| and being willing to put yourself forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| And believe it or not, Lee Trammell has never threatened me about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| But I know that each of you will move forward and do what's best for this community and work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:05| And if you'll notice today, this commission meeting is working just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| The sheriff's office is working fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4089)|

| 1:08:14| The county clerk's office is working fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Our government is working fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| It is not upside down as we tend to see so often in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| There are some problems to work through, but I know that you all will make it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| and it will be a better community in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4108)|

| 1:09:12| Both have the same rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Chairman, could you have it read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Yeah, read it into the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Whereas Mike Lowe, a native of Knoxville, is a graduate of Doyle High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| received a bachelor's of arts in business from Tuscaloosa College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| and is a certified public official through the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Whereas Mike Lowe began working for the Knox County Trustee's Office in 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| Whereas Mike Lowe was first elected trustee of Knox County, Tennessee, in 1994, again in 98, 2002, and 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:53| And whereas Mike Lowe was chairman of the Knox County Trustees Association Legislative Committee from 1997 to 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4193)|
| 1:10:03| Whereas the Knox County Commission, on behalf of all the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| wishes to honor Mike Lowe for his service in the office of trustee and as Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| The Knox County Commission honors Mike Lowe for his 32 years of dedication to the trustee's office in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| and faithful service to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Now, Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair, since you're handling business and Commissioner Moore is down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| Mike Lowe has just done an outstanding job as the trustee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| He has modernized the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| We are now able to process tax collections much faster, earning the county much more money and interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| and therefore helping to keep the property taxes low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| He's opened five satellites to serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| You no longer have to come downtown to pay your taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| and he has just done an outstanding job in making the trustee's office much more profitable for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| much more efficient, and much more public friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| So I want to thank the job that Mike Lowe has done for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Mayor Ragsdale, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| I would. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| I said this many times in the past, and I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I think Mike Lowe was the best trustee we had in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| He's done a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| It was a pleasure for me to work with him over these years, and it's still exciting to work with him every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| He has the people's interest at heart, and it's a pleasure to honor him along with the county commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| So with that said, Mr. Vice Chairman, I'm going to turn things over to Mr. Lowe for a few words, if that makes you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:52| You know, I can't believe that 33 years has gone by so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| It really has been an honor and a privilege for me to serve the people of Knox County over the past 12-and-a-half years as trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| We have made some real progress, but it wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| It was my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| They've done such a tremendous job of being able to put it together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| and modernize an office that, quite frankly, was behind the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| And we continue to work in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| We went from a budget of a little over $85 million in tax collections when I was elected in 1994| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| to over $200 million this past year, handling over half a billion dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| And my staff, I have to give them the majority of the credit for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| Like I said, you know, when you've had the opportunity to serve the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| an opportunity to try to really make a difference in county offices, I think we've been able to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| But like I said, you know, it really the employees are the ones that deserve the vast majority of the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| I've enjoyed my opportunity to work with you and the other office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| And it's a shame that it has to end in this type of situation, but that is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| And I look forward to making Knox County a better place each and every day that I'm here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| and I look forward to working with you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4380)|

| 1:15:49| In my term in this office, I have never once had a complaint about his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| A lot of times complaints end up on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Never heard that about Steve because his office and himself personally was all about service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| serving the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4563)|

| 1:16:16| his sincere dedication and willingness to serve Knox County's 400,000 citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| So, Steve, on behalf of Knox County Mayor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| it's a pleasure to join Chairman Moore and the commission today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| in telling you how much we appreciate your wonderful service to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| First of all, the commission was on the board when we made the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| You appointed the best registrar of deeds that you're ever going to see in Cherry Whip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| But I'd like to say, you know, the registrar's office, when I came in the registrar's office in 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| it was a very few years later, about three years, we had to do something to take weight off of our floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| So we got into the computer business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| The first office in the state of Tennessee and the first office in the United States to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| I knew about as much about it as I do today in starting an airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| But we've had a very good office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| We have a very good staff that made it very easier to run that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| The same staff is there by the appointment you all made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| And all I can say is I love Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| I don't think you've seen the life of Steve Hawk, but I certainly appreciate each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| I certainly appreciate the concessions of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:59| Panel one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| This is a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| approving an amendment to the Knox County Employee Benefit System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| to provide a deferred compensation plan and providing irrevocable commitment of the county to fund said plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:22| Okay. Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Finance voted 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| I'll make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| We've got a motion on the floor to approve, seconded by Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| I'd like to hear from someone representing the pension board to find out exactly what they approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| My name is Richard Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| I'm general counsel for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| The two resolutions you have before you today are the commission's action necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| to actually implement the plan amendments that were adopted on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| and final reading this morning by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| 9-0-1 refers to the enhancements to the present defined contribution plan provided for general county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:26| And 9-0-2, of course, provides the approval and funding commitment for the uniformed officers pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:35| You'll see the fiscal descriptions are included in the resolutions last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:45| The enhancement of the D.C. plan is presently estimated at $1.7-$1.9 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:57| And for the uniformed officers plan, of course, as we've discussed several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| that carries with it an unfunded accrued liability of a total of an estimated $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| The normal cost plus that accrued liability amortized, you're looking at approximately $6.4 million for fiscal year July 1-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:26| I'll be happy to try to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Mr. Beeler, would you explain to us what the enhancement is on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| I understand it's going from 6% to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Let me ask Kim Bennett, who's the Executive Director, to give you some more detail on that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:51| Hi, I'm Kim Bennett, Executive Director of Retirement here at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| The enhancement proposed in front of you today to enhance the current plan is a two-fold part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| First of all, the plan would allow for voluntary contributions on a pre-tax basis starting July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| by bedding up a different type of IRS plan against the one we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| Secondly, it would allow for voluntary contributions that could be matched based on seniority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:23| And the voluntary contributions that would be matched would, after five years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| if an employee puts in 2%, then the county would match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| After 10 years of service, 4% in the county would match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| And after 15 years of service, 6% in the county would match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| So you mentioned the word voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| This is not a mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| This is not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| This incremental cost is strictly voluntary for those people who put in and they can be entitled to a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| So as I look at this, 1.9 is what we're looking at for persons other than uniformed bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| You look at the uniformed bodies, that's 6.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| So starting January 1, 2007, and I'm getting a little ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| We're going to talk about the uniformed bodies in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| but I just want to make sure that I'm aware that beginning July 1, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| we're looking at an additional $8.3 million to fund these pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| That is projected on the uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| Those are the closer ones we handle their enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| I have a question regarding, actually regarding 902, the uniformed officers pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| Well, we haven't got there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Then I'll hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Just for everyone's sake, each member of the commission is eligible to be in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| so just so everyone knows before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Clerk, 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| approving the adoption of a uniformed officers pension plan under the Knox County Employee Benefit System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| and providing the irrevocable commitment of the county to fund said plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| I vote 9-0 for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| I vote 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Second by Commissioner Trantle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| During our initial consideration of whether to put this on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| we quickly passed on the notion of instead of doing it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| allowing the uniformed officers to roll over into the Tennessee Contoliday Retirement System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| If we had gone that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| what would our unfunded liability be instead of the $57 million we're staring down the neck of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| I couldn't begin to estimate that, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| Yeah, because that system is completely different from anything we're operating at, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:11| I couldn't even give you a good estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| And our actuary said it would require a full actuary study to give you a reliable figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Fifty-seven million is a substantial chunk of change, and that's what we're going to have to decide on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Mr. Bennett, if you're an employee here, how long do you have to be here to receive the funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| I mean, if you leave in two years or seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| just sort of explain what the implications are there for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| because people think they put their money in and they think they're going to get all of what the county is putting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Give us the chart of how that's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Under the Uniformed Officers Pension Plan, which I call it UOP for short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| an officer who has been here already with seniority 15, 20 years, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| their account balance is going to roll over into the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| Now, if they were to leave after 15 years, they would have a vested benefit and entitled to a pension plan, pension payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:14| but they would not be able to draw anything until after they would have completed 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| But they would be able to draw a retirement plan from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| They could withdraw their contributions plus earnings, and it's 4% earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| They can withdraw that and they give up any pension retirement benefit at retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| So an officer that signs up January of 2008, how long before he's vested, he or she's vested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| Vested after five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| They can't draw anything until they would have been here 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| That's always the biggest problem is people think they're vested from day one and they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Five years is vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Okay. Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| One more question regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| I believe the estimate, the $57 million estimate, assumes a return on investment of around 7.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| Seven and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Others have suggested the more reasonable estimate is around 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| If it turns out to be around 7%, are we staring a figure something in the neighborhood of about $63 million, actually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| It would be increased, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Seven and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| Okay. Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Mayor, since we're talking about the $57 million unfunded liability, any thoughts on how we're going to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:40| Commissioner, we've got the departmental budgets in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| We plan on putting those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| And right now we're just in the preliminary stages of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| I would be a little remiss trying to go out and give you anything which may or may not hold in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| I do know that Mr. Werner and Mr. Troy are working very hard at looking at our various options that we have available in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:06| But we will have this ready at least by May for your consideration and hopefully your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| But right now I'd be a little bit early in the game to say how we're going to pay for it because with all candor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| our citizens voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| We're going to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| But to say that it's not a steep climb is just not being truthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| But we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| I didn't know if we're looking at trying to do this, amortize it over a 30-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| Are we going to try to collect it all, pay for it all up front, or a combination, or any ideas on that, or is that still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| We've had conversations with people in Nashville that we'd have to get approval off to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| just to make sure that that's an option that we have available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| We've talked to bond counsel about other ways that we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| So we're going to try and be very creative to fund this program in a way that's fair to those who are in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| but also in a way that doesn't damage ongoing operations in so many important areas in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| in particular our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| I just want to disclose I work for the Knox County Sheriff's Office and will be eligible for this pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| My husband works for Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| And my wife works for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| And my father works there part-time, but they're not eligible for the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5316)|

| 1:28:41| Only one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Can't afford this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Clerk, we're on approval of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5336)|

| 1:28:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| We're on elections and appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Resolution 110 is approving the reappointment of Jerry Julian to the Knox County Housing Authority Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| We're on 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5355)|

| 1:29:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Yeah, 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| I was looking at 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Finance approved 10-0 and so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Okay, do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| This is a resolution appointing members to the County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:04| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Second by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Yes, Mr. Chairman, we were handed a sheet before the meeting started about an appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| which is different than what we had discussed in our previous meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| so I guess I'm asking for clarification on exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| I think there may be several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Which one do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Is it a one-page or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| One page with regards to commission appointments, citizen appointments, and employee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| It was handed out earlier, I believe, by Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Mr. Mayor, do you want to explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| We have before us today, I think, three potentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| The administration will work with you on either or any of those three potentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| Before I go any further, I want to publicly, regardless of what happens here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| thank Commissioners Ballard, Smith, Hammond, and Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| as well as Ms. Martha Phillips for being willing to serve on the commission that I originally proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| that you approved at your January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| The decision is yours which way you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| You have three options to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| We will work with you on each and, again, any of those options that you choose to go forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| And regardless of which one you select,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| I'm prepared to make recommendations to you today for members that I would choose for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| If you vote on the original proposal before you, I've nominated those five individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| I think they're five very good men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| And if you go a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| I'm prepared to nominate in conjunction whether it's option B or option C as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| So I appreciate what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| I'll start out with this one that worked on over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| It's the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| It would consist of seven members and shall be appointed for a one-year term by the Knox County Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| and the Knox County Commission as followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| Two members of the Knox County Commission with one appointed by the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| and one appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Two full-time employees of Knox County to include employees of the Knox County School System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| with one appointed by the Knox County Mayor and one appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| Two citizens of Knox County who meet residential requirements of being a Knox County voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| who are not employees of Knox County and are not directly related, i.e., to spouse, siblings, parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| or child to any elected official in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| One such citizen shall be appointed by the Knox County Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| and one such citizen appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| And have one constitutional county office appointed mutually by the Knox County Mayor and the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| Should no constitutional county officer be willing to accept the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| an additional member of the Knox County Commission or a member of a board, committee, commission, authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| or corporate governing by the policy shall be appointed mutually between the Knox County Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| and the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| And I've asked, working with the county mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| that the Ethics Committee shall convene as soon as possible after their appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| to elect their chair and secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| And the Ethics Committee shall be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| The secretaries shall maintain the records in the county court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| They would be open to public inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| And we'd also like to strongly encourage people on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| to participate in an ethics and government training held by the county technical assistance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| or other certified ethic training within the 90 days of their appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| And we have one scheduled in Knoxville with CTASC on March the 15th, just a few weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| So that's one plan that we worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| Okay. Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Are we now to speak about the original motion or this substitute or the forthcoming substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| No, you can go ahead and speak if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Okay. I would like to speak in favor of the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| We passed this at our January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| There was no objection raised then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| And CTASC, the group that you just mentioned, does a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| The county technical assistance service not only helps this county but counties across Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| And I think the question that it dealt with is dealt with well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| It's really two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| How do we assure accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| How do we assure citizen involvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Citizen involvement is assured by the fact that any citizen, any person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| can bring an ethics complaint to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Accountability is assured by the fact that we are only given one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| And if this body doesn't like what we've done or the mayor doesn't like what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| that whole process stops and we don't get reappointed to this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| So when you look, and if the public is really upset about our ethics action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| they can always not re-elect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| So accountability is already built into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| And it is also a very practical matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| If we approve the CTASC system that we did in January and stick with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| we don't have to seek additional approval from the Tennessee Ethics Commission for a new version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| I think that's also true of Phil Ballard's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| which, by the way, we just added an advisory group to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| But I think the resolution that the chairman has proposed will slow us down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| because we'll have to go to the Tennessee Ethics Commission to get approval for this special variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| So why not go with the one that this very good and noble group has come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| that considered these matters and built in adequate safeguards for accountability and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| Let's go with that, what we originally proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| and let's do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Thank you, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Let me just clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Whatever plan we pass or modify, I don't think we have to get approval from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| We just have to file it with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Mr. Law Director, could you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| I have corresponded with the Tennessee Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| And two members of that commission have advised me that they are merely a repository for the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:40| They do not have any authorization to review or approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| or reject any county or municipality's ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| What they do is receive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| If they don't receive them, then they have the authority then to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| But if we make any change other than, if we make any change at all to the CTAS policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:07| then we will have to file our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| If we adopt just the CTAS policy, all we have to do is to notify the Tennessee Ethics Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| that we have so adopted CTAS's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| But they don't have any authority to do anything other than merely being a repository.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| I had asked them, too, if even if we had an ethics committee, which is not required, by the way, by the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| but if we had such an ethics committee that would receive complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| could complaints also be filed with the Tennessee Ethics Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| And their response was, no, they are merely a repository.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| They do not receive complaints of county or municipality type policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| Does anybody such as the legislature have to approve a variation of the CTAS model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| I mean, CTAS was charged by the legislature, by the legislation itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| of coming up with a model policy for counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| MTAS was charged with the same responsibility for cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| And the only one that I'm really acquainted with is CTAS's policy, which we have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:27| You finished, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| Yes, I had added a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| I don't know when you bring that forward, if you do it now without a first, second, or is that what I need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| Probably just an option to some of the ones already on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| I don't know if I ever put mine in as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So, I mean, if you want to, you can put yours in maybe first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| I'll make a substitute motion, and I think you all have the paperwork in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5934)|
| 1:39:01| Mine is a little bit different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Actually, I heard Lee Trimble talk about the citizens' input on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| and when I left and came back, that stuck in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| And I've tried to put a few more citizens go along with the original make up of CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| and sort of keep it in that format, not that anybody's as bad today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| but I think between the ones that we have and that we have on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| surely we can come up with one that will work and we can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Do we have a second to the substitute for Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| So we're on the substitute motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| So anyone wishing to speak for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| I'm a light on another issue about that, but this is for Commissioner Ballard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| You had that the additional five members from the community would be an advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:03| They would help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| And you said a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| Would that be better if we had it really in the March meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| I mean, we could approve those names then for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| or is it so vital that we move especially short of that meeting for a special meeting of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| I'm certainly open and would modify anything if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| Well, I think rather than calling a special meeting for that purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| that if we did it in a March meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| they could add to that five persons and meet what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| which I think is a great idea myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak on this whole issue before we vote on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| A question for the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Mayor, if you could come explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| There's been some confusion as to just what this ethics committee is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| what power it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| what's it going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| I mean, tell us what you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| And there's been an awful lot of speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| I want to make sure everybody's on the same page here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| because I'm hearing all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| The ethics committee, I think, came out of the general hearing last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| following the Tennessee Waltz investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| and as a part to try and reform government ethics across Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Each of us need to be cognizant of how we vote or, in my case, how we act and appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| With that being said, I think the ethics committee has very little power in terms of issuing punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:43| I do think they have a great deal of authority in terms of addressing issues that may be brought to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| where ethical violations are deemed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| I'm not going to debate Mr. Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| I had heard that process the other way at the county mayor's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| but if you've had that conversation with them about the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| I would hope that the ethics committee would be a place where elected officials as well as citizens could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| when they have valid ethical concerns they can present to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| I would hope that the ethics committee would work with those in government to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| If you had a question, for example, I'm curious if this is an ethical violation, you would take it to that group for an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| So I see them playing a very large role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| And while it was mentioned that an ethics committee was not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| I think that each of us would be making a mistake if we didn't approve an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| I just think that sends a bad signal to our citizens and one that we don't need at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| So you're saying we pretty much just set guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Somebody comes to us and says, I think there's been a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| Then who acts on that violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Who does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| Well, if it's a violation of the law, then I think that your attorney general would act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| I think that's what you would take to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| If it's an ethical violation, I think, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| they would notify the person that you've had an ethical violation and hope you wouldn't have in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| And I think the advantage of it for those of us who are in elected positions like each of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| it gives us an opportunity to present to the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| here's something that I've had presented to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| Does this create an ethical violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| So you can get some feedback on the front end before it becomes a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| So I think we need to use it as a useful tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| not as a tool of punishment just for the sake of trying to beat up on folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| For the law department, where are we going to get our guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| Do we have the state of Tennessee gives us guidelines to go by, or does this committee just start from scratch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| Commissioner, you pretty much start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| You take the policy as was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| It gives you some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| And I hope perhaps in the next month to be able to give you some further information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:07| which may lead to another amendment of the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| which would give us even further guidance on what is expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| what a reasonable person could determine would be a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| or what a reasonable person would determine is not a violation in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| But the policy itself gives us some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| And that's basically all there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| So, Mr. Mayor, you're saying then if we find something, who's going to enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| It will be the Attorney General if something went wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| So this committee would not be doing any enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| I really appreciate Commissioner Ballard working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| I know he's put a lot of work in it, and I can go along with it, all except one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| The citizens will just be adversaries in nature with no voting rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| Now, if we're wanting to include the citizens in this, they should have a voting right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| I would think that we need to amend this to where they have a voting right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| because if there is anything out there that they think that we've done wrong up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| which I haven't had any complaints in my district, only one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| but I think we need to include the citizens in it and they have a voting right on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I would have no problem making that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Isn't there a proposal coming up where the ethics committee would be all citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| I mean, I really think that this needs to be a citizens group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| Maybe, I think Mr. Trammell mentioned in one of the committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| that we have a nine-citizen panel on the ethics commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| one person from each district chosen by the district commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| I mean, I just think that would be a lot less politicized group if we had all citizens on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| and, you know, rather than having elected officials, you know, overlooking ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| I just think it would be much more effective to make this a regular board and appoint all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| I'll speak for that just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| We talked to Doug Goddard in Nashville, and they set it up to have all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| They set it up to have people who understand government a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| So you just don't walk in, you don't understand the whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| That's why in the proposal that myself and took it to the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| and we worked through it, has dealing with two commissioners, two employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| And you've got to remember that the school system comes under these guys as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| and they have 8,000 or 9,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| So we thought they should have a place at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Also, a county employee of general government and two citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| So it makes up a board that I think brings everybody to the table when we're dealing with an issue such as ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| So, you know, not to speak against, totally against Commissioner Ballard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| but I think this plan right here would be more fair and to bring everyone to the table when we're dealing with ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| and I think that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| So, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| I would just argue that the inverse might be very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| If we have a committee made up largely of persons who are favorites of the existing commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| that the public will not perceive them as being open-minded enough to ethics violations as they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| Rather, leave it in the accountability system that I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| We're accountable for this one-year appointment to both the commission, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| and we're accountable to the public at the ballot box if we fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| I'm looking at both of these here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Commissioner Ballard has done a good job and a lot of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| I do agree with what Commissioner Pinkston said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| I'm just curious, Commissioner Ballard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| how do you feel about the other one that's been circulated that the chairman has been talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:27| It has seven members in it, and, like I said, when I thought about mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| mine was for a little more citizen's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| And mine also represents all nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| And there will be a great deal of input, I'm sure, from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| They'll look to the commissioners that they're appointed from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| And if you like the idea of more citizens on the ethics committee, I think mine is the better one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6529)|
| 1:49:01| Commissioner Ballard, can you explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Because I don't know, I don't see how you're representing all the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| when I see that the commission would approve five-member citizens group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| Well, if there's four commissioners, at least five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:17| So one from each group, one from each unrepresented district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| Commissioner Cate, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| I guess my point is I think both of them are good proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| and I commend everybody that's been involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| It looks to me like we may be able to take this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| and if we add a couple of names to it that we may be able to get to where you're trying to go, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| And, I mean, not names per se, but categories of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:53| And I'll just say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| I think the mayor and some of us on commission are ready to roll out the names today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| and get this ethics panel in place today so we can start letting them do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:07| So that's also a plus on this unless Commissioner Ballard is ready to name his people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Yes, this is not whether we should accept either of these two proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| and I think they both have merit, and we're discussing the merits of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| This is a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| When did this resolution become effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| You're talking about the ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| The ethics policy that was voted on at the January Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| When did it become effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| It was voted on January 22nd, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| When did it go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Resolutions by our charter do not become effective until they are signed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| Do you know what day it became effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| I know that it was following the meeting, the commission meeting on January 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| The mayor says February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| Okay, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| The plans are similar in some aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| On number three of the, I guess the one that you read from, not mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| if we were to add two more citizens to that and give them four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| then I would withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| So moved, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Mr. Chairman, I need a copy of that, of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| I don't have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Somebody got a copy that Commissioner Smith can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Is that agreeable to the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| So we'll change it from two citizens to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| Do we also keep the provision of the not represented districts, or is that still relevant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:54| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| We wouldn't, would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| I think under that plan that that wouldn't really be relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| because you're only having two commissioners appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| so there's no way to get there with four that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| And I think at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| certainly we need to look at this group from several vantage points, geographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| places of employment for our employees, racial diversity, political diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| all types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| And I think we can do that very effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:35| I believe he was talking about citizens, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| That's what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Mr. Maldry, you mentioned you would have more information about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:49| Not particularly about the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| but more information to share with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| and perhaps adopt something that would give us better guidance on what a reasonable person standard really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| or what it is not is even a better way to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| Well, that information that you would have next month would not affect us going ahead with this committee today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| if we choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| It would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| Getting back a little bit to what Commissioner Harmon had said, Mark Harmon, that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| could we add in there that the citizens must come from districts other than those who have commissioners represented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| Although it's just two, at least it assures that they come from a district that is not represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:45| Although there's seven other districts, at least those four come from somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| whereas if we don't say anything, then there's the possibility that you could have a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| that comes from one of those two commissioners or even possibly two of those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6834)|
| 1:54:02| Would you like to agree to something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| Mr. Mayor, do you have an input on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| I'm prepared to do my nominees today, and I'm not certain where they live, to be truthful with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| I've got a pretty good idea, and I think we're doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| but it's the prerogative to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| You know, I'm not going to propose somebody that the majority of you don't feel comfortable about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| You can tell me, and I would just simply withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| I think you're going to be very pleased with who we propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| Well, I think if you we haven't increased the number of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| so if you don't have a citizen that's within those two districts, we're only adding two more citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:44| So we just would make sure that they're not already citizens within the two districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| of what you have commissioners that you'd like to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| And, again, that's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| It's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| I was just trying to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| The Metropolitan Planning Commission, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| I work very hard on making recommendations to you that spreads across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| If one happens to be very far apart and represent a different community in reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| and they happen to fall in the same commission district, I don't look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| We're spread over 500 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| So it could be one district may encompass 50 or 60 square miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| and somebody could live on opposite ends of it but still be in the same commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| I think today you're going to be very pleased with who I propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| I'll withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| I was just, you know, it may just be something that we need to think about if we do have someone being nominated as a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:39| and they happen to live within a commissioner that's on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| then we might need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| That may need to be considered before we approve that citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| But I don't foresee any conflicts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| Vice Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| I was trying to figure out who is the author of this second proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| You and Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| To be truthful with you, Mr. Arms is the author and he presented it to us and, you know, we will work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| I think both of us are excited about that potential that could be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| So you're the chairman of both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| We've concurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| I was glad to hear you speak of having diversity because if you didn't have an African-American on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:29| I would ask this body to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| One of my nominees will be an African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| I would suggest that what I guess we have on the floor now is this version right here going from seven to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:51| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Seven to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| Seven to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| Two citizen members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Is that what's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| I think that's a good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| I would suggest that we go ahead and vote on this composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| And as soon as the mayor has his names to present for this commission before we adjourn today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| then we go ahead and vote on his thing and appoint our people today so it will be fully effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| So, one, we will vote on the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| And then whenever we have the names, we go back and approve the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| As soon as people are at the meeting, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| I think the mayor is ready to go ahead with the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| If he's ready, then that would make it okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| Let me just state again, I want to put this as a substitute motion with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Mr. Chairman, I'm assuming you'd like my name right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| If you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| We still have some lights on, but let's get the names out there and we might cut some lights off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| And there's one of these individuals who I haven't asked yet, but I feel that I can get their concurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| I am going to nominate Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| And let me say up front, it's my intent to rotate that one commission appointment every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| So I'll be going with a different commissioner in that seat every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| I think a one-year term is plenty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| so we'll be rotating that among four different people during my last term in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| The second appointment will be an employee of the Knox County School System, Ms. Kim Waller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| She has served as president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| We'll go back to full-time librarian in our school system next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| My third nominee is Frank Shanklin, Sr., a small business owner who I have great confidence in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| And my last nominee will be Dr. Ron Stewart, the senior minister at Grace Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| The ones that I come up with through talking to a few of you, Commissioner Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:55| I asked Paul to serve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| Mike Duncan, he is with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| He is certified in ethics, also has a great background of being an investigator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| and I think that brings a plus to the ethics panel because they are going to have to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| And former county executive, Mr. Tommy Shumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| And we still have one more name we have to come up with because we've changed the makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| that this commission gets one more name of a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| So I guess if anybody has a name they would like to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| Actually, it's two names, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| Well, the mayor picked one because we're trying to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| If anybody has a name, I'm happy to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| And I would suggest that maybe everybody look at the geographic makeup of these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| since we may not know, and then maybe come up with one more name next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:50| Or if anybody has got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Well, I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| I guess the term limit turmoil is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| We're agreeing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| We're going to get this ethics panel done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| You and the mayor have come up with this solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| But I do have a name, Marty Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| He's my next door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| He's a great guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| I think he went to school with Mr. Warner, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| I haven't asked him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Mr. Warner vouched for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| Also, since we've already talked to her, I'd like to ask the commission to consider Ms. Martha Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| I think the chairman is fine with that as the nominee from the county wide office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:38| Is that okay with you, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| If it's fine with the rest of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Mr. Law Director, on the structure first and then vote on all these nominees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| It's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| I mean, I would prefer a separate question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| Go ahead and vote on which policy it is that you wish to amend or basically which amendment you wish to have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:07| and then vote on the nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| If there's no objection, I'd like to call for the question on the structure of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| We have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| So the only thing we're changing in the proposal is on item number three, changing it from two citizens to four citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| I didn't hear any no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| It passes unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| Now I guess we're back to the appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| So we've had Commissioner Trammell nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| Who was it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| Marty Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| Pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| Did you serve on ethics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| Did you serve on ethics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| Do you think we could take a recess so I could call him and ask him if he'd be willing to serve before we vote him in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:09| If you ask him, he'll probably do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| Do we have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Would you nominate Pastor Sexton from Temple Baptist Church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| I think the mayor would probably be agreeable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| I like both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Now we've got to vote somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| Well, I'll withdraw Marty Bradley's name then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Withdraw Marty Bradley's name and replace it with Pastor Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Clarence Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| Yeah, Pastor Clarence Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Mr. Chairman, could we list those again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| Paul Pinkston, Commissioner of the Ninth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| Mike Duncan, he's a captain in the Sheriff's Office and has been trained in ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| I think he's even taught in South Africa and some other places across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| Also brings some investigative skills with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| I think he's been with the Sheriff's Department for probably well over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| And Mr. Tommy Shumpert, the former county executive of this county, and Pastor Clarence Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| And then the mayor could also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| You listed how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| In addition to our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| You listed four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| In addition to our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| We need to list five more to get to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| Our joint appointee would be Ms. Martha Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| My commission appointee, Mr. Hammond, with the understanding that's going to be rotated every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| The other nominees would be Ms. Kim Waller from the Knox County School System, Frank Shanklin, Sr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:43| and also Dr. Ron Stewart with Grace Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| May I ask the commission chairman, does he also intend to rotate the nominee he will be presenting each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Commissioner Trammell, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| Just one real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| The term begins today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| So we're talking one-year appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| So we want to make sure that the term starts today and would end a year from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| Is that what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Just so everybody knows going in what the term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Let the law director tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| The term pursuant to our policy, which we need to talk about this, it may begin today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:33| but it will end at or around September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:43| Let me find the language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| When we appoint the other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| So that would be September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| Or the first meeting of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| Of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| So in actuality, this first body, their term would expire here in seven months, eight months, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:09| instead of a full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| I guess if we wanted to, we could do that or let them roll over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| My problem with allowing them to serve this part year and another year, the next full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| I think that would probably be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| I just want everybody to understand what they're committing themselves to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:29| I know Mike Hammond says his plate's full, but he's happy to take this on, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| It would probably be better if we let them serve to the next septum, not this one coming up, but the following one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| But I think we'd still have to re-vote to allow them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| So everybody knows up front what they may possibly be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| So September 1 of 2008?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| Until then, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| But we may have to reappoint them come September 1 of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| Is that correct, Mr. Hall Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Is that fine with the county mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| We would have to reappoint them September 1 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| Mr. Chairman, we have nine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| Are we now ready to vote on those nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| We're ready to vote, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| Paul Pinkston, Commissioner Paul Pinkston from the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| Mike Duncan with the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| Former county executive, Mr. Tommy Shumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| And Pastor Clarence Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| And then the mayor has Commissioner Mike Hammond, Frank Shanklin, Sr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| Kim Waller, and Dr. Ron Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| And Ms. Martha Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| So is everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| That's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| Well, let me thank the commission and Chairman Moore for working with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| I think this is a step that we can use to build on as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| I'm optimistic about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| I hope you are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| We've got a lot of things we need to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| And obviously our path is pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| One of two ways we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| We can fall into a trap of bickering with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| or we can fall into a path of trying to work with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| I hope we can take the latter path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| I know it would certainly suit me more favorably, and I hope you feel the same way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| I certainly like this path we started down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| Next item, I think it's 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| approving the appointment of Frank Shanklin, Sr. to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| Intergovernmental voted 8-1 for approval with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| And we, Greg, you had a name that you had put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| I think it was James Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| You should have a bio on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| I think he sent it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| And I'll make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Well, we'll hear from the other committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7702)|

| 2:08:29| Second by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7709)|

| 2:08:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Vice Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| I don't know what happened in the intergovernmental with the name of Frank Shanklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| but him being put on the ethics committee, he's a very good man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| and I'm glad that we did that for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| I agree, Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7730)|

| 2:09:00| there was discussion that his son, I believe, is on the city industrial board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| Oh, yeah, so a takeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| Yeah, we saw a takeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7756)|

| 2:09:20| I think is Mr. Harrison here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| You might want to come on down and introduce yourself, Mr. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:38| Could you produce your citizenship papers, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| I left it at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7781)|

| 2:13:00| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| The reason I asked this to be removed is that we learned during the committee meetings that the prime beneficiary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| of this is the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=7986)|

| 2:14:05| Is someone here from the public building authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:13| Do you know if they're wanting to move forward with this, Mr. Warner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| It's my understanding that, yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| I raised a question the other day in committee of whether, in fact, the public building authority is a open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:37| comes over the Open Meetings Act like this commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| And why it seems on the face of it, this seems a worthwhile thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| At the same time, I wonder from the law director whether if that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:54| then that seems to be somewhat contrary that their vote and discussion is held in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8094)|
| 2:15:04| Could the law director say this would be a violation or not a violation of that law before we would vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:12| I think we had asked for someone from PVA to be here to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| and I thought they had suggested that their attorney would be here to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| And he is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| But I can answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| Yes, they are covered by the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| The Sunshine Law does apply to PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| Would this comply with the act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| Don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| I don't know that it's ever been tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| Obviously, it is created by Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| So you would have to assume that Tennessee law would not contradict the express provisions of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8147)|
| 2:16:03| But I don't know that it's ever been tested, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| Mr. Dale Smith, are you wanting to move forward with this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| I had emailed you and Mr. Owings last Thursday or Wednesday, and we would like to withdraw it because, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:21| excuse me, I almost ran down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| We would like to withdraw it because we never considered that it would be construed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| or viewed as kind of circumvent Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| We just thought it was a useful tool we might have in our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| But it's just not that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| So given the reservations that I heard expressed in the committee meetings, we just would like to withdraw the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:49| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8209)|

| 2:16:53| Probably just bad timing, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8216)|

| 2:18:35| For the new commissioners, we, the county and the city of Knoxville, entered into a growth plan agreement back on January 11, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:46| As part of that agreement, Section 7 of the agreement, each of you should have it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| It's an attachment to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| It provides that the county adopt drainage standards for development that are at least as strict as the drainage standards used by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8334)|
| 2:19:04| within 60 days of the execution of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| Well, as I said, the agreement was executed January 11, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| Now, the county did adopt drainage standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| And I understand we're looking at others right now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| But we adopted drainage standards a year and a half or two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| There is at least some disagreement by the city that, between the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:36| that those drainage standards are as strict as the drainage standards adopted by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:43| So we have, or the city has a claim that they don't wish to surrender by the operation of the statute of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:51| So what they have done, they have provided me with a tolling agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| which for a period of time will, Knox County will not assert its defense of the running of the statute of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:09| This is a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:10| Statute of limitations is six years by Tennessee code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| If there were a violation, it could have occurred within the first 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| We had 60 days to adopt drainage standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| And so the city has counted six years from that time, and that would be around March 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:33| So they have requested that we enter into a tolling agreement instead of between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:42| and the end of the second week in March filing an action against Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| I've reviewed the tolling agreement and recommend its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| Second by Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| So, Mr. Law Director, this is just, in effect, delaying it and still leaving everyone their same legal rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| That's fine then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Nice habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Mr. Law Director, do we want to hear Commissioner Mark Harmon's proposal now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:28| I mean, certainly you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| It would be 8.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| Clark will make this 8.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| It was added to the agenda, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| It was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| Let me just go ahead and add everything in the commission it was supposed to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| because there's some things that need to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| Okay, Clark, if you'll just read the caption, I guess, and then we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| Knox County Commission agrees to the following proposal for the County Law Director to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part1?start=8516)|
