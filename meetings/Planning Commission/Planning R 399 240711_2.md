| 4:24:13| I think I've lost my place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15853)|
| 4:24:19| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15859)|

| 4:24:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15866)|
| 4:24:26| Two more to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15866)|
| 4:24:34| OK, we have a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15874)|

| 4:25:02| Staff recommendation, approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15902)|
| 4:25:04| to amend the previously approved plan district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15904)|
| 4:25:07| to increase the maximum height of a townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15907)|
| 4:25:10| from 35 feet to approximately 41 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15910)|
| 4:25:13| as presented on the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15913)|
| 4:25:15| subject to the one noted condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15915)|
| 4:25:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15917)|
| 4:25:19| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15919)|
| 4:25:22| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15922)|
| 4:25:23| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15923)|
| 4:25:26| We have two people signed up for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15926)|
| 4:25:29| Mr. William Burton and Mr. Lamar Lepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15929)|
| 4:25:35| Is that Leopard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15935)|
| 4:25:36| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15936)|
| 4:25:37| Leopard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15937)|
| 4:25:38| Yeah, Leopard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15938)|
| 4:25:39| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15939)|
| 4:25:41| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15941)|
| 4:25:41| I'm opposed to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15941)|
| 4:25:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15943)|
| 4:25:44| And what is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15944)|
| 4:25:45| Patrick Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15945)|
| 4:25:46| Patrick Kelly, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15946)|
| 4:25:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15948)|
| 4:25:50| All right, if you'll set your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15950)|
| 4:25:53| My name is B. Lamar Leopard, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15953)|
| 4:25:56| and I live at 9416 Clingmans Dome Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15956)|
| 4:25:59| I moved to Knoxville from South Carolina in 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15959)|
| 4:26:03| I recently retired from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15963)|
| 4:26:05| as an engineer, programmer, and eventually group manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15965)|
| 4:26:09| after 32 years, and built my retirement home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15969)|
| 4:26:12| in the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15972)|
| 4:26:14| My townhouse, when viewing straight out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15974)|
| 4:26:17| from my rear-facing rooftop deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| looks directly on the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| that are being discussed in this variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15981)|
| 4:26:24| I chose my retirement home vacation very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15984)|
| 4:26:26| expecting the 35-foot height restrictions in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15986)|
| 4:26:30| would always be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15990)|
| 4:26:32| I will significantly lose my views of the mountains and lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15992)|
| 4:26:35| if the property behind me exceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15995)|
| 4:26:38| 35 feet above ground level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15998)|
| 4:26:40| I'm very much opposed to approval of this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16000)|
| 4:26:43| You are aware that the properties under this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16003)|
| 4:26:46| are within a 1,000-foot boundary of the scenic portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16006)|
| 4:26:49| of the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16009)|
| 4:26:51| The state law says you can't build anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16011)|
| 4:26:53| higher than 35 feet above ground in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16013)|
| 4:26:56| You may hear from those supporting the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16016)|
| 4:26:58| that the North Shore Town Center is somehow exempt from this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16018)|
| 4:27:01| but reading the law itself clearly states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16021)|
| 4:27:04| the restriction on buildings shall apply to the scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16024)|
| 4:27:06| highway, notwithstanding the route being located inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16026)|
| 4:27:10| or outside a municipality, and notwithstanding any law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16030)|
| 4:27:14| or ordinance to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16034)|
| 4:27:16| Therefore, there are no exceptions to this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16036)|
| 4:27:20| Secondly, if you approve this, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16040)|
| 4:27:24| will be approving a violation of Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16044)|
| 4:27:27| Secondly, the front of my law faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16047)|
| 4:27:29| Clingmans Dome Drive, which is approximately 10 feet higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16049)|
| 4:27:31| in elevation than Horizon Drive behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16051)|
| 4:27:34| The property has only three stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16054)|
| 4:27:36| exposed above the ground level in front of my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| because the bottom floor is below ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16059)|
| 4:27:42| If anyone supporting this variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16062)|
| 4:27:44| tells you that numerous lofts in the town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16064)|
| 4:27:46| already exceed 45 feet, they're misleading you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16066)|
| 4:27:50| My loft is less than 35 feet in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16070)|
| 4:27:53| because it has three exposed stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16073)|
| 4:27:56| Third, I drove the scenic link to the parkway yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16076)|
| 4:27:59| and found no structures exceeding three normal stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16079)|
| 4:28:04| Approval of this variance would be the only totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16084)|
| 4:28:09| above ground, four-story building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16089)|
| 4:28:12| within the entire scenic portion of the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16092)|
| 4:28:16| Finally, Mike Stevens is not only the builder requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16096)|
| 4:28:19| this, but he is also one of my neighbors in the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16099)|
| 4:28:23| I don't like this, but I'd like to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16103)|
| 4:28:25| by reading a text message that our neighbor Mike personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16105)|
| 4:28:28| sent to my wife earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16108)|
| 4:28:31| My wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16111)|
| 4:28:34| If you really show up at NPC and oppose us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16114)|
| 4:28:37| I will not be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16117)|
| 4:28:40| We can build them three feet lower with no variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16120)|
| 4:28:43| and I will build them, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16123)|
| 4:28:46| It seems Mike does not think he needs anyone's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16126)|
| 4:28:49| to exceed the 35 foot height restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16129)|
| 4:28:52| and that he intends to do so regardless of today's outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16132)|
| 4:28:56| In fact, it appears to me he may have already done so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16136)|
| 4:28:59| on some recent properties built on Horizon Drive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16139)|
| 4:29:02| are four stories, but only have a few feet of their bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16142)|
| 4:29:04| floor below ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16144)|
| 4:29:06| I do not know who approved these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16146)|
| 4:29:08| without an approved variance, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16148)|
| 4:29:10| seems they made a huge mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16150)|
| 4:29:13| Regardless, you should not honor prior mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16153)|
| 4:29:16| by making a worse one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16156)|
| 4:29:18| I respectfully request you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16158)|
| 4:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16161)|
| 4:29:24| That's my handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16164)|
| 4:29:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16165)|
| 4:29:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16166)|
| 4:29:27| We'll wait on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16167)|
| 4:29:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16191)|
| 4:29:53| Well, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16193)|
| 4:29:54| My name is William Burton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16194)|
| 4:29:55| My wife and I live at, oh, she had to step out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16195)|
| 4:29:59| at 9410 Clingmans Dome Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16199)|
| 4:30:02| And I'm here today to ask you to deny this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16202)|
| 4:30:07| for the following three reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16207)|
| 4:30:10| First of all, it fails your test that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16210)|
| 4:30:14| consider as a committee when deciding yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16214)|
| 4:30:19| First of all, is it compatible with the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16219)|
| 4:30:22| of the neighborhood, including the size and location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16222)|
| 4:30:24| of the buildings in the vicinity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16224)|
| 4:30:27| I'm going to say no, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16227)|
| 4:30:29| It's going to stick out like a sore thumb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16229)|
| 4:30:32| because that's six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16232)|
| 4:30:33| It matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16233)|
| 4:30:35| And this is in the last block of townhomes to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16235)|
| 4:30:40| So if you can imagine, if the mountains were that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16240)|
| 4:30:44| it's where everyone is looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16244)|
| 4:30:45| I think I put in there a line of sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16245)|
| 4:30:49| so you can see where this structure would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16249)|
| 4:30:53| Secondly, is it consistent with the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16253)|
| 4:30:55| the one-year plan, sector plans, adopted plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16255)|
| 4:31:00| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16260)|
| 4:31:01| In fact, I tried doing my research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16261)|
| 4:31:07| Over the past seven years, this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16267)|
| 4:31:09| has approved six different items in the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16269)|
| 4:31:15| And in each one of those six, the 35-foot maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16275)|
| 4:31:21| was reinforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16281)|
| 4:31:23| This exception would be the only one and the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16283)|
| 4:31:27| and it's going to be in everyone's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16287)|
| 4:31:29| And so either four people are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16289)|
| 4:31:32| to have it, or the 20 to 30 townhomes behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16292)|
| 4:31:37| And we all can enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16297)|
| 4:31:39| So I close with, again, asking you to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16299)|
| 4:31:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16305)|
| 4:31:47| All right, you may speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16307)|
| 4:31:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16308)|
| 4:31:52| If you'll try to keep it to two minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16312)|
| 4:31:54| I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16314)|
| 4:31:54| I'm sorry, I'm not an orator, but I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16314)|
| 4:31:59| In the prayer at the beginning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16319)|
| 4:32:00| Could I get your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16320)|
| 4:32:02| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16322)|
| 4:32:02| Patrick Kelly, 9417 Horizon Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16322)|
| 4:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16325)|
| 4:32:05| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16325)|
| 4:32:09| In the prayer at the beginning of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16329)|
| 4:32:11| the words meeting the needs of the people were mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16331)|
| 4:32:15| If we keep the townhome to a height of 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16335)|
| 4:32:20| then the new townhomes will have a view of the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16340)|
| 4:32:23| Then my neighbors will have a view of the mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16343)|
| 4:32:25| and I will have a view of the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16345)|
| 4:32:27| And then that will meet all of our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16347)|
| 4:32:30| Also, to speak to the word need, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16350)|
| 4:32:33| is the need to go above 35 feet and violate the building codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16353)|
| 4:32:40| Do they have a need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16360)|
| 4:32:42| It may be mentioned that there are already houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16362)|
| 4:32:44| taller than 35 feet, not just because of the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16364)|
| 4:32:49| If that is the case, then those just fell through the cracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16369)|
| 4:32:53| and they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16373)|
| 4:33:00| Can the builder just build the building shorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16380)|
| 4:33:02| or lower the foundation six feet into the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16382)|
| 4:33:05| Please don't approve of this and take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16385)|
| 4:33:07| mine and my neighbors' beautiful views of the mountains, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| is one of the selling points I was promised when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16389)|
| 4:33:12| I built this home with Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16392)|
| 4:33:15| Please have the builder follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16395)|
| 4:33:19| The staff recommendation comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16399)|
| 4:33:21| did not mention that the extra height will, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16401)|
| 4:33:24| take away our mountain views entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16404)|
| 4:33:25| which will detract from my house value mentioned in item number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16405)|
| 4:33:28| four and will affect at least I don't know how many homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16408)|
| 4:33:34| The extra six feet will be the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16414)|
| 4:33:37| to where I can either see the top of the mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16417)|
| 4:33:39| or completely taking them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16419)|
| 4:33:41| I do have a picture, if that'll help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16421)|
| 4:33:43| And thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16423)|
| 4:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16425)|
| 4:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16426)|
| 4:33:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16427)|
| 4:33:49| Let's see, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16429)|
| 4:33:59| Hello, Ken Bowman, 9515 Bluegrass Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16439)|
| 4:34:03| on here for Mike Stevens Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16443)|
| 4:34:07| I just refer to the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16447)|
| 4:34:10| I think that if you go through the notes and the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16450)|
| 4:34:14| and looking at what we're proposing to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16454)|
| 4:34:18| this is the last townhouse loft, as we call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16458)|
| 4:34:24| to be built in North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16464)|
| 4:34:26| And it is between two existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16466)|
| 4:34:30| And because of the road grade, this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16470)|
| 4:34:33| will not exceed the height of either building on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16473)|
| 4:34:39| And it's because of the way the road slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16479)|
| 4:34:42| The determination of the height goes to grade plane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16482)|
| 4:34:46| as you all state in the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16486)|
| 4:34:50| So this building is identical in design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16490)|
| 4:34:57| as the building to the immediate left, which is a fiveplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16497)|
| 4:35:01| The building on the right, they are all four stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16501)|
| 4:35:05| So I understand the concern of the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16505)|
| 4:35:08| But we're talking about from rooftop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16508)|
| 4:35:11| your elevation will not change from the existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16511)|
| 4:35:15| on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16515)|
| 4:35:16| And it will conform to the development as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16516)|
| 4:35:20| So I ask for you all to approve staff recommendation, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16520)|
| 4:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16525)|
| 4:35:26| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16526)|
| 4:35:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16539)|
| 4:35:40| Commissioner Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16540)|
| 4:35:43| Sorry, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16543)|
| 4:35:43| I know you went over this on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16543)|
| 4:35:45| But just so I'm crystal clear, what the applicant just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16545)|
| 4:35:49| like, the slope of the road makes it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16549)|
| 4:35:52| my understanding is the slope of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16552)|
| 4:35:53| makes it to where they build it six feet higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16553)|
| 4:35:57| But when they're done, is it true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16557)|
| 4:36:01| that the roof height will be flush with the surrounding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16561)|
| 4:36:06| Existing buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16566)|
| 4:36:08| I said that in the possible, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16568)|
| 4:36:10| I don't, I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16570)|
| 4:36:12| I'm not sure what the actual elevation of the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16572)|
| 4:36:15| structures are to the roofs, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16575)|
| 4:36:17| compared to the existing grade of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16577)|
| 4:36:21| I know the property, so if you're looking at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16581)|
| 4:36:26| if you're standing on the road looking at this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16586)|
| 4:36:28| the buildings to the left, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16588)|
| 4:36:30| are higher, because I remember looking at topography grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16590)|
| 4:36:33| Like, those, the topography is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16593)|
| 4:36:35| The topography is coming down towards this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16595)|
| 4:36:39| I don't recall the properties to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16599)|
| 4:36:44| how the topography goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16604)|
| 4:36:46| So naturally, it will be sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16606)|
| 4:36:49| the buildings will be sitting slightly lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16609)|
| 4:36:51| just on the finished floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16611)|
| 4:36:57| But I really couldn't tell you if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16617)|
| 4:37:00| going to be the same height, slightly taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16620)|
| 4:37:03| I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| But is it true that there'll be a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16625)|
| 4:37:07| like, from sidewalk to the top of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16627)|
| 4:37:09| it won't be 41 feet, necessarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16629)|
| 4:37:14| Yes, measured from the average grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16634)|
| 4:37:16| in front of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16636)|
| 4:37:18| And I would assume the average grade's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16638)|
| 4:37:22| going to closely follow the sidewalk out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16642)|
| 4:37:25| Now, the way that these are constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16645)|
| 4:37:27| they actually have, like, a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16647)|
| 4:37:31| yeah, it almost seems like a New York style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| like, brownstone, like, little patio that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16653)|
| 4:37:37| lower than grade in front of the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16657)|
| 4:37:39| So it's a little bit, it's not your typical townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16659)|
| 4:37:43| where the ground just goes right up to the front elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16663)|
| 4:37:46| of the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16666)|
| 4:37:47| So it might feel just a tad bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16667)|
| 4:37:51| But when I was looking at this, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16671)|
| 4:37:56| was looking at mainly from an urban design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16676)|
| 4:37:57| like, how is this going to make somebody on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16677)|
| 4:38:00| feel different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16680)|
| 4:38:01| I wasn't looking at it from a sight line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16681)|
| 4:38:05| I think from adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16685)|
| 4:38:07| It's not really something that we typically look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16687)|
| 4:38:10| especially if somebody had promised views that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16690)|
| 4:38:13| were going to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16693)|
| 4:38:15| It's not part of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16695)|
| 4:38:16| It's not part of the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16696)|
| 4:38:19| These structures, they have an elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16699)|
| 4:38:22| that goes up to the second story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| They have a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16704)|
| 4:38:25| And then they have their penthouse, third story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16705)|
| 4:38:29| So from a massing standpoint, because the third elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16709)|
| 4:38:32| is stepped back, it doesn't feel as tall from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16712)|
| 4:38:35| So that's the way I was looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16715)|
| 4:38:39| It doesn't address what their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16719)|
| 4:38:41| what the neighbor's concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16721)|
| 4:38:42| But that's the way I was looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16722)|
| 4:38:44| I was not going to feel like you had a towering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16724)|
| 4:38:47| building over the top of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16727)|
| 4:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16729)|
| 4:38:49| I just wanted to get clarification over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16729)|
| 4:38:53| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16733)|
| 4:38:56| I guess my question is for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16736)|
| 4:38:58| Why are you wanting this to increase to 41 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16738)|
| 4:39:05| That is based on the grade plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16745)|
| 4:39:08| You average out the lower height and the higher height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16748)|
| 4:39:12| to create the grade plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16752)|
| 4:39:15| And being that it is in between two existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16755)|
| 4:39:21| it's identical to the building on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16761)|
| 4:39:24| I have a drawing that shows elevations that would show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16764)|
| 4:39:28| that the height is consistent with both buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16768)|
| 4:39:32| on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16772)|
| 4:39:34| So the 41 feet, depending on if you measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16774)|
| 4:39:38| you have buildings in there that go over 40 feet if you measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16778)|
| 4:39:43| from rear elevation that say the lowest point of grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16783)|
| 4:39:48| Grade plane's determined by the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| from the sidewalk to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16790)|
| 4:39:52| So that's going to vary from building to building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16792)|
| 4:39:55| So it sounds like we're asking for a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16795)|
| 4:39:59| It's very consistent because of topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16799)|
| 4:40:01| We're in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16801)|
| 4:40:03| This development, if you've driven through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16803)|
| 4:40:05| we have buildings that are connected that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16805)|
| 4:40:06| step down from one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16806)|
| 4:40:08| We're at the very flattest part of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16808)|
| 4:40:12| and the lowest part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16812)|
| 4:40:14| We backed up to target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16814)|
| 4:40:16| And so with the two buildings on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16816)|
| 4:40:19| we feel this request is consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16819)|
| 4:40:21| consistent with either building on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16821)|
| 4:40:25| It will not be taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16825)|
| 4:40:26| So from skyline and view, it will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16826)|
| 4:40:29| obstruct any more than the buildings on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16829)|
| 4:40:33| And just to clarify, the average grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16833)|
| 4:40:36| is on the front elevation of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16836)|
| 4:40:38| It doesn't go backwards towards the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16838)|
| 4:40:41| It's just whatever, if you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16841)|
| 4:40:43| at the front elevation of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16843)|
| 4:40:45| whatever the average grade is along that front elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16845)|
| 4:40:48| So really, if you look at their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16848)|
| 4:40:51| you have the three units on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16851)|
| 4:40:53| Everything is very flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16853)|
| 4:40:56| The average grade in front of those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16856)|
| 4:40:58| along the front is relatively level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16858)|
| 4:41:01| It's the last unit where the grade drops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16861)|
| 4:41:04| because there's an alleyway between just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16864)|
| 4:41:07| to the right side of this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16867)|
| 4:41:10| So they're dropping the grade down to that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16870)|
| 4:41:13| So this last unit just has a different average grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16873)|
| 4:41:18| than the rest of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16878)|
| 4:41:19| So it has a slightly taller need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16879)|
| 4:41:22| has a slightly taller height by average grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16882)|
| 4:41:24| The other units are still over the 35 feet, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16884)|
| 4:41:26| So they're not, they're all over the 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16886)|
| 4:41:30| The last unit, the one on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16890)|
| 4:41:32| is the one that's technically the tallest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16892)|
| 4:41:34| in the only sense that the average grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16894)|
| 4:41:36| in front of that structure is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16896)|
| 4:41:43| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16903)|
| 4:41:47| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16907)|
| 4:41:49| All right, Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16909)|
| 4:41:51| I move we approve the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16911)|
| 4:41:56| figuring it's gonna be essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16916)|
| 4:41:58| the same height as the other buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16918)|
| 4:42:00| It's gonna block a view no matter what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16920)|
| 4:42:04| but I think it's consistent with the topography plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16924)|
| 4:42:10| So per staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16930)|
| 4:42:12| As per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16932)|
| 4:42:13| So the motion is to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16933)|
| 4:42:15| to amend the previously approved plan district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16935)|
| 4:42:17| to increase the maximum height of a townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16937)|
| 4:42:19| from 35 feet to approximately 41 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16939)|
| 4:42:21| as presented on the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| subject to the one noted condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16943)|
| 4:42:24| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16944)|
| 4:42:26| We have a second by Commissioner Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16946)|
| 4:42:29| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16949)|
| 4:42:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16952)|
| 4:42:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16952)|
| 4:42:34| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16954)|
| 4:42:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16955)|
| 4:42:36| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16956)|
| 4:42:40| We have one other item here, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16960)|
| 4:42:42| let's see here, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16962)|
| 4:42:49| The appointment of the Executive Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16969)|
| 4:42:51| Vice Chair Huber is compelled to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16971)|
| 4:42:54| and then we have Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16974)|
| 4:42:57| Levinson, and Browning have been generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16977)|
| 4:43:00| of their time to agree to serve, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16980)|
| 4:43:03| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16983)|
| 4:43:04| We're adjourned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16984)|
| 4:43:05| Yeah, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=16985)|
