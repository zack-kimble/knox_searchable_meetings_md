| 0:00:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=21)|
| 0:00:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| We've got six members present, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=29)|
| 0:00:37| We have enough for a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| There's only one item on the agenda, and it was basically, and I'd like to thank Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| Byrd from Comcast for being here, so if anybody has any questions for him, he is present to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=48)|
| 0:00:56| answer any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Reason for this is to discuss recommendation to the full commission that we instruct the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=59)|
| 0:01:06| law department to finalize a contract with Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| They've been on a month-to-month contract for eight years, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| I could be corrected on that, but it's been about eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| The original contract was 1992, was the original one, and I was informed by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=80)|
| 0:01:29| that there was an updated one in 2001, but it was never really implemented, but we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=89)|
| 0:01:39| have two amendments to that one in 2001 that has been implemented, so we need to clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| this up so that we can get a contract going that's up-to-date and current and get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| a long-term contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| So I'd entertain, I guess, a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=117)|
| 0:02:05| Question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| What would be the extent, I mean, how many years are we talking about on this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| It'd be something that we'd work out with them through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| I would say, you know, four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| That's normally what a contract is, and Mr. Byrd could probably answer to what the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| ones have been, but usually it's a four- to five-year contract normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Russell Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| I'm the executive, excuse me, I didn't say pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| I'm the director of external affairs for Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| My address is 5720 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| And Mr. Brown, a couple years ago we were in the process, most of our franchises we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| did for five years, but now with the advent of the state-issued franchise with the TRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| which is ten years, most of the agreements that we'll be looking at in the future would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| be ten years, which would match what our competitors have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Why are we on a month-to-month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Why have we been on month-to-month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| How long did you say it's been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| It's been about eight years, and from my understanding, and I'll let Mr. Byrd speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| Mr. Thomas, our original franchise expired in 2005, and at a point shortly after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| we entered into negotiations, and due to changes within the law department, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=216)|
| 0:03:45| that we were maybe 60 or 70 percent towards a satisfactory agreement in the county change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=225)|
| 0:03:55| law directors, and then it kind of put us in a position where we started over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| There was a time that a consultant was being utilized who was asking us to agree to exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| the same agreement that Knowledgey had, whereas the provisions of that agreement did not specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| relate to Comcast, because we were at that point in time an incumbent cable operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| versus a person who was applying for a franchise and had burdens placed on them for the build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| out and the completion of that, so there were some things there that we weren't able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| get past in those negotiations, and then the law director changed again and kind of put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| us in the position that we wanted to wait and see what was happening with the state-issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| franchises, and just time has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| It goes fast when you're having fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| It goes fast when you're having fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I have had fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| In order that we have something to discuss, let me see if I can make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| can get some agreement on that we, the Cable Committee, recommend to full commission that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| the law department move forward with arranging a franchise agreement between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| and Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Okay, seeing we have a motion and a seconded, all in favor, or any more discussion, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Okay, then following with some discussion, I believe some people may have thought today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| would be some kind of discussion between Knox County and Comcast about the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| currently being provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| I'm not against talking about that, but I believe that we can handle such after we dispose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| of this motion, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| I think that's all technically that we're here to do today, is to recommend that commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| enter into an agreement, and it will have to be prepared for us by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Now then, commission, we are Knox County, so we should be the one stating, sitting as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| commissioners, what we think to the law department about how the contract ought to be written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| or what it ought to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| Could I speak to something, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Do we get before this comes up from the law director to have him give us a little background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| on what we've got now, what we'd be going to before we really vote on it, before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| really discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Yeah, I have the current contract, both versions, and I will make sure that it's all distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| to you all, to what we currently have, and then that way any questions that we can direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| towards the law department about how we want it mirrored or whatever, then when they start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| to negotiations with Comcast, then they can know what our wishes are, I guess, from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| And so when agreement is made, the commission as a whole will have the final approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yes, it will come back before the full commission for approval once it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| Okay, any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| How does this change in the state law with the franchising affect this committee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| the way we'll govern in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| It won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| We'll still govern the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| We'll still regulate Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| We'll still be the oversight of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| It won't affect the state franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| It's just Comcast is chosen, from my understanding, to stay local with our contracts and not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| a statewide franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=480)|
| 0:08:11| Everyone vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| All in favor say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Yeses have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| So this is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| We will instruct the law department now to, well, to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| Can we get that on this month or should we wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=510)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| I think what we've done is we've taken an action and we will give this information to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| the full commission in about 50 minutes and see what they want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Seeing nothing else on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Now, as we get into this negotiation between the county, Knox County, and Comcast, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=538)|
| 0:09:09| sure there will be a lot of people that will want to present some kind of information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| what they desire or what they'd like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Now, how we go about discussing that, as I said a moment ago, I think some people will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| hear today to try to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| Do we wish to hold public forum for anyone making comment at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| And I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| I believe that if there's someone here that has come to speak about this issue being before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| commission that they could also speak now before the cable TV committee just to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=579)|
| 0:09:48| points of view on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| If there's anyone in here that would like to speak towards this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| That's a familiar face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Mike Hammond, criminal court clerk, 8103 Birchall Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| Being new and looking at our situations in our various courts, one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| I would suggest as you look into this is the opportunity for us to have, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| if more outlets is the word, more boxes is the word, but as an example, when our jurors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| come in, you've seen the hallway that they sit in, and sometimes they'll be sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| We would like the opportunity for them to be able to view TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| So I would ask that we look at what we would need to do to work with Comcast to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| I know that inside the jury room there may be a possibility, too, that we might be, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| know we're going to be putting a new screen in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| I'm not sure how the judges are going to feel about letting them watch TV, if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| possibility that something that they're deliberating might be on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| But if they're just kind of waiting, again, it's just something for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| In our offices, for example, we do not have any TV screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| I'd like for our employees, if there's a major news event, weather-type related event, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| like for us to be able to turn the TV on so that they can see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| And again, just in looking at it, talking with our building people, I'm not that fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| knowledgeable about it, but I know that this is something that I'd like to request on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| of our department is that we look at either additional outlets or additional boxes, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| we would need to do to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| I have noted this, and I will make this known at the full commission meeting, too, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| we instruct the law department so that they can make that part of their negotiations in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Is there anyone else in the audience that would like to address the Cable TV Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| about this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Seeing none, I'll call this meeting of the Cable TV Committee adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Let's have a little sound here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| I'd like to call this meeting, Knox County Commission Work Session, to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=722)|

| 0:12:43| Commissioner Brown, would you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| You all rise, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=777)|
| 0:13:10| Next item on the agenda is to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=790)|
| 0:13:20| Do I have a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=802)|

| 0:13:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| So we're out of order already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Commissioner Anders has already got out four that we need to discuss that will not be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Those that will not be on consent are 18, 27, 31, and 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| And also we need to add to that item number 7 because there is a vacant, there's a blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| We need to add in a name on 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=859)|
| 0:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Also we have two other commissioners now should be counted as present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=871)|
| 0:14:48| Do we have any additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| I would like to put a couple of items on for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| One of them is for the Conner Road Bridge for a park out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| That's Save Our Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Or as we could say, the SOVs out there in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| But anyway, I would also like to put on there the best school practices which the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| have in their hand to get discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Maybe where I could go and see in Greenville, South Carolina, how they do their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| how they build them and the way that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Also a message from Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| Item 4 will be postponed until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| Also add a discussion item to next Monday's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| reference to breastfeeding and pumping in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=956)|
| 0:16:05| Also we need to add a discussion item from the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| That's what I was going to have, but you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| I'd like to add a discussion item on the reconstitution of the joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=982)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Also without objection, the discussion item of the PPU audit will be held Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| not today, but next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Are there other additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| I guess as a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| I looked at what Commissioner Anders had on the non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| Was the audit committee's recommendation consent or non-consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| I'd like to have that pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Is there a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| There was something on there, wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| The discussions that we may have coming out of the audit committee will push to next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| because the auditor isn't here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Number 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Yeah, it's number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Yeah, on number 30, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| If that's a consent item, are you saying that's been pushed back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| That is not a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| If you wish to discuss it, we'll pull it off consent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Number 30 will be off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Did you say the PPU discussion was pushed to Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I will not be here Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| If we could, I would still like to discuss it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| The PPU discussion will be as a discussion item today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1108)|
| 0:18:41| Make a motion we add all that needs to be added and take off all that needs to be taken off and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1121)|

| 0:19:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Currently at this time, I do not think we do not have a name to put in that blank as an applicant at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1169)|

| 0:20:36| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| No, I was just going to say, how do we determine, you know, when this contract, I mean, who determines this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| Would this be the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Would it be the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Would it be the engineering department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I mean, who decides when that contract is executed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Mr. VandeVate, name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Dwight VandeVate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| This is really, we have had a similar contract to this in place for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| and I forget the vendor for that particular contract, but I'm glad to tell you it was never used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| and I'd submit to you that we hope this one is never used as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Our typical standard is going to be a FEMA-eligible disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| So a typical spring storm or a snow storm, the kind of events that we see year in and year out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| would not be a catalyst for use of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| This is going to be for some sort of major, likely community-wide, significant disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| I mean, like a, heaven forbid, big tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| F5 tornado, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| But it wouldn't be for the garden variety spring and summer storms or winter storms that we see every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| Like I say, our hope is that it's never pressed into service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| and there is no cost to the county unless we actually mobilize the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| How long did we have the contract with the previous vendor that we never exercised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| Let me ask Drew Thurman to come up and speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| And Drew did a fine job putting this together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| He's our contract compliance manager in Solid Waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| and obviously Solid Waste is the logical place for this to reside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| They have to manage all the debris that's collected under the terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| Or somebody that actually looks more like Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Matt Myers, Knox County Purchasing, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| The previous contract was in place for three years, and that was the only time that we had allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| So it was time to re-bid this, and this is where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| And as stated by Mr. Vanderveet, there's no money out the door at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| It's only when it's used that we have expense to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| That was my most asked question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| Mr. King, do you wish to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Mr. Chairman, members, John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| I just saw this on the agenda, and I have not had a chance to talk to anybody about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| but this talks about removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Is disposal of the material still as per your existing contracts with who gets the disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1385)|
| 0:23:14| whether it's, you know, what I call municipal-type solid waste or whether it's trees and branches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| The county has contracts for dealing with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| I don't know if this is an additional disposal or whether the disposal of the items goes under the other contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1404)|
| 0:23:34| Matt might be better able to speak to that or Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| One thing I would point out, and certainly a very relevant question Mr. King asks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| but consider that in an event like this you are going to have multiple types of waste streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Mr. King has an interest in the sort of thing that we ordinarily collect, which we'd call green waste or organics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| But we would also have in a case like this typically demolished buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| and debris of that nature which would go to a different facility than green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I just wanted to say I'm, like Mr. VandeVeet, I'm thankful that we have not had to use this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| but I would like to commend the staff that he has under him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| and Jim Snowden in particular for the jobs that they've done since I've been sitting up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| and I know they were doing it before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| But being here we get all the complaints about the trees down and this down and that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| and it's amazing to me how we can have a storm come through at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| and when you go to work in the morning the road's clear and you can get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| So I know they work long and hard hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| and I just want them to know that I appreciate the work that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| and I'm thankful that we have such a great crew in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| My question determines between these two companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| who is determined number one and number two, and how is that determination made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| Commissioner Brantley, we set up evaluation committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| and there are evaluation criteria in each RFP and each bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| and they're set on a point schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Evaluators evaluate these individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| and then submit their total scores to the purchasing division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| We calculate the scores and come up with a ranking one through however many are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| In this case there were three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| We look at cost, experience, capabilities, different things for different RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Is that information public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Motion and second properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| On page eight, item number 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| consideration of an initial resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| determining the issuance of general obligation qualified energy conservation bonds of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| in an aggregate principal amount if not to exceed $12,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| This is resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| So moved to get it on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I'm sure Chris is going to expound on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Yeah, I think Chris is on his way down to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Is he signing autographs or the most eligible bachelor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| How lucky am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| This is part of Knox County's solar plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and we've got Ameresco, who won the bid to help us with any solar initiatives that we may do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| And this is through the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| It's qualified energy conservation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| And approving this does not approve us getting bonds in the amount of $12.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1632)|
| 0:27:22| It's just the process to get it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| And from that standpoint, it would be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| If we were able to do a project as to where we would use solar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| then the savings would at least pay back the principal and interest on the bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| and anything over that amount, then we just recoup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| The next step, if this is approved, is Ameresco will begin to work with TVA in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1668)|
| 0:27:58| And as far as the bonds, I can defer to Mark Mametoff, our bond counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| and he can explain more of how these QECB bonds do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1684)|
| 0:28:14| Mark Mametoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| These QECBs are a lot like a lot of bonds that were authorized during the stimulus package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| Instead of getting tax-free interest, you get tax credits paid back by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| They can result in essentially no interest rate on the bonds if it's structured correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| As Chris said, we've got a long way to go before this is a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| This is a very complicated transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| The only other one that's been done in Tennessee so far is one we did in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| for their Bridgestone Arena to basically make it more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Memphis is looking to do some. Lebanon's looking at doing some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| So we're not totally unique, but it's not been used widely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| There's quite a bit of allocation left over, and the state's looking to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| This would be a great project to use it for, but because we're in the TVA footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| it raises some really interesting tax issues for geeky guys like me who care about that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| This is just the first step in going down this path toward doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| It could be a very low-cost way to do some energy-saving solar installations here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1759)|
| 0:29:28| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| So is it strictly solar, or is there water conservation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| My understanding, and I can stand to be corrected, that this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| what we've asked the state to allocate for is strictly solar projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Okay. I just know before, and Chris, I know Chris remembers, but he may want to comment on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| that we had folks show up at our luncheon, and we were ready to sign the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| and then TVA, and they couldn't agree on it, and the payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| TVA changed the program after we started with our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| So this is a different circumstance, and we're working with TVA on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1802)|
| 0:30:11| We're not working through a specific program that we were working on beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| This is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| I mean, but I think at the end of the day, solar wasn't paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| TVA changed because it was basically costing the rest of the customers money to have these solar panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1824)|
| 0:30:35| So is that going to be an issue with this going forward, I'm wondering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| As we go through the process, once we get to a point to where we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| if we get to a point to where we see it's not financially feasible for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| then that's when it stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| And so it's just getting the process started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| and seeing if we can do something to utilize solar to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1858)|
| 0:31:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Chris, that had something to do with the buyback rate, did it not, the deal before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, it was a program that, and I can't, it's been so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| but TVA changed the buyback rate percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| which caused us from where we could be fine and not show a negative cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| to where there was no way that we could do it without not showing a positive cash flow to like year 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Does this, is this contingent upon a buyback rate too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| and is there a length of time that you get a lock in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| With these bonds, it's kind of, it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Now, we do have the concern of sequestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| We got an email this week about how that amount changed by a tenth of a percent again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| and so that always has an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| This will deal with TVA on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| and Ameresco will deal with them on projects that we may have in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| how, I'm not a solar expert, but how they will interact with them on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| to see if it's a project that TVA is willing to help with and us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1937)|
| 0:32:28| A motion and second is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| On page nine, item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| This is a resolution directing the Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| to conduct a performance audit of the school nutrition program, resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| I hear a motion. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| You know, I think we all just got an email from the chair of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1988)|
| 0:33:18| requesting an audit of this same department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| So I just think it's probably more proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| since it's a department that fallen under their auspices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| that we allow them to request that audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| I mean, it's the same desired result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| but I think it's more proper to come from the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| and Mr. McMillan has issued us a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| I just think that's, again, a better way to get the same result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| An audit's an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| The same folks are going to do the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| He actually asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| So I think that that's we can discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| but I just think that that's a better way for it to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and hopefully they'll, I mean, it's their bodies, it's their departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| it's their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| I'm going to leave it there for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| but I'd like to maybe see what the body thinks about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| In the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Commissioner Bussler had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| There is a charge that's given to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| It's under 49-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| In section C, number three here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| it says it requires its finance committee to examine the accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| of the county board of education quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| or at any other time it may appear that the county board is misusing any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| public funds or exceeding the budget adopted by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| I believe under that we can require from us an audit by the charge by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| I don't disagree with that, but to me that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| that audit that they're requesting would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I think you're making my point beautifully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| they would give us a document through Andrea that we can look at and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| okay, is this something that we like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Do we want to take the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| We don't, we've not seen anything at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| so this would give them an opportunity to do due diligence in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Right now we've seen basically a story in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| So we could get into their shorts at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| or we could allow them to have an independent body take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Either way, we're going to get to the same result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I mean, you know, at the end of the day there's going to be an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| and it's going to be by the Knox County Independent Auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Again, I'm just putting that up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Okay, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| I need to clarify that this is a report from the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Not asking, not saying that there should be an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| but it's a place marker in case there needed to be an audit because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| audit committee did not have enough information in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| It's time to make a decision, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| So, Commissioner Bussler, unless you have something else to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| I need to go to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Well, from my understanding, the audit committee was the first one to request this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| And in the end, the commission, regardless of who requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| the commission has to approve it being done or it doesn't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| I mean, that's the buck stops here as far as her work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| So, let it be known that it started from this end, not across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2233)|
| 0:37:21| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Well, it's not two audits that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| We're talking about the same audit, and it's just coming from two different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| So, it's my understanding we're looking at the same audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| and it's the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| and should we not be initiating the audit for the school board or for whoever shares it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| I disagree with you, Commissioner McKenzie, that instead of the school board initiating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| they've asked us to initiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| The procedure is the audit committee asks the commission to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| and then we ask it be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| There are several issues floating, legal issues floating in this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2285)|
| 0:38:14| The county has created an audit committee whereby requests for audits can come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| and it has a historical reason for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| The school system, through its director of schools, according to the duties of the director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| if and when the director deems that there's a problem, could be or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| then he could come before the audit committee and request something to be brought before county commission to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2317)|
| 0:38:45| The real, the chairman of the board of the Board of Education can do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| but the way you have it structured procedurally, all audit requests either are initiated by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| and sent to the audit committee for review and come back to you with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| or they bring a recommendation to you for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| The only issue related to how anything may or may not be done is that our internal auditor is a separate person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2350)|
| 0:39:22| and they receive their scope and duties from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and those that are being audited are not privileged to work on the scope and duties of an internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2365)|
| 0:39:33| As a matter of fact, you should be separate and apart in that duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| So if the school board is requesting an audit, then properly they would come before the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| They can always come before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| But in the end, you follow your procedure as to how an audit is occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| and it's separate and apart from what any department in Knox County, school board, mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| any other department would follow this same procedure, so it's not this unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| However, the unique responsibility is a director of school responsibility to report to commission the legislative body any fraudulent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2403)|
| 0:40:14| And I'm not saying that's the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| I'm just stating what superintendent's responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| If he deems that to be occurring, then he has a fiduciary duty to bring it before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| And that would also be part of, I think, what Mr. Bussler was talking about in terms of the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| There are different ways that it can be brought, but in the end, you follow your audit procedures that we have in place here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| and the bodies being audited are not part of that scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| I hope that cleared up a big, muddy situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| And Bud said a lot of what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Andrea even sent out an e-mail last week that went to the school system as well as, I can't do this on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| It has to come from the legislative body for me to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| So they would have to come before the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| The audit committee has already acted on this and is requesting us to initiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| So that's where it's at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| It doesn't matter if the school wanted to or not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| The audit committee has acted, and that's where it would have to go anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| So that's where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I just have a procedural question to be certain that it's clear in my mind what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| The reason we established the audit committee is so we wouldn't have individual commissioners just go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| and tell the internal auditor to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And just as a matter, it really isn't an independent auditor that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| The internal auditor works for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| That is a commission employee or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| And I guess my question is, to be absolutely clear, the reason we established the audit committee was to screen these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| to be certain that before an audit was performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| and the internal auditor devoted her resources and time to do it, it merited having an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| I guess my question is, is to be absolutely clear, this has gone through the proper procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| of what the intent of the commission was and has been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| It's now been vetted and screened by the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| and the audit committee says that this is worthy of an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| That's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| As a member of the audit committee, we had no more information at the time of the audit committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2554)|
| 0:42:44| than was what was available in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| This resolution before us is taking into account items that we have at that time we didn't have any knowledge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2568)|
| 0:42:59| other than what we were able to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| I said it a few minutes ago, this is more like a place marker to bring commission up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| that at that time we didn't know what we maybe should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| And another question that was asked at the audit committee would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| will this audit interfere with ongoing other legal activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2598)|
| 0:43:27| That question did not get, in my opinion, a proper response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| It didn't get any response in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| The response that was delivered at that was that occasionally there are audits performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| that reveal things that need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| This is a reverse of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| The audit committee was reading the news accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| and is recommending that full commission take a look at the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| and, if appropriate, have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| It is up to this commission and only this commission to determine whether there should be an audit or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| by the internal auditor of the nutrition program of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| I guess the only issue I have with that is it seems to me the audit committee should have gathered the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| and they should have come back, and maybe you are coming back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| This reads here that the audit committee says we need to conduct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| Not that we consider it, but that we conduct it, because that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| The intent was for us to discuss it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| The audit committee is recommending that we conduct an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| That's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Is that the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| I guess yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Well, I mean, I'm just going to get my last say and then I'll turn off my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| But to play, you know, I say to play with the rules or to do with the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| if the audit committee is recommending this and they have the information and they're saying to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| I'm going to go ahead and vote for this because this is how we're supposed to be doing it these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| is that the audit committee has vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| They say it has whatever information they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| They say it has merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| They're the ones that have done whatever investigation could be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| and they say that it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| That's how we're supposed to be doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| That was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I've got a letter in my hand here from Greg McMillan that was sent to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| and he's asking the audit committee about this letter saying, I want an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| Now, with us having this in hand, written like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| we are required, if I'm understanding this correctly, to go ahead and do the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| We are directed to vote on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I'm going to direct you to vote on this resolution in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Mr. Chairman, if, in fact, either the director of schools who's standing before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| and or the chairman request, and according with the statute, this body to do an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| then basically your duty is to require the audit and direct the audit committee to conduct the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| and give them the scope or the parameter or let them develop it through your direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| Conversely, there's two ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| and the system is set up to keep individual actions from occurring and overworking the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| However, statutorily, there are really two ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| You can come before this body with your proof and plead your case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| and this proof can direct the audit committee either to do further research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| or if it's overwhelming and you all decide, you can direct an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| The second piece is that if you receive information from the director or superintendent of schools here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| or the chairman, if they think there's some issue that needs to be audited financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| then as a finance committee, you're basically required to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| It's your fiduciary duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| And then you would direct the audit committee to do whatever's necessary to fulfill that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| So you've got two trains running parallel, and it really, the audit committee came with your recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| and then the director of schools and the chairman have come, I presume, with a recommendation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| So it's kind of before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Seeing no other lights, thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for bearing with us as we discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Do you wish to speak to the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| My name is Jim McIntyre, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| The letter that you have from Mike McMillan, chairman of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| is a request for the internal auditor to work with the Board of Education to conduct an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2880)|
| 0:48:09| But I think it's a little bit of a distinction without a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| It's a recognition that only the county commission can instruct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| and direct the internal auditor to do the work that she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| But I think what I heard and what I think Mr. McMillan heard from the audit committee when they last met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| was that this is an issue that's one of importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| There are some allegations that have been made and that, you know, it's the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| from what I understood, wanted to see the school district taking the lead on this issue if we so desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| And if we didn't, then the audit committee and the county commission probably would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| So I think the letter that you have before you is simply a recognition that the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| the chairman of the school board, and I believe that conducting an audit of our food and nutrition services department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| is a good idea, given the allegations that have been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| and that we would ask and request the county commission to direct the internal auditor to do precisely that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| The only place where there's a slight difference is we're actually asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| the county commission and the internal auditor to go over and above simply a financial audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| But also, in talking with Ms. Addis, her office has the capacity to do an independent risk review as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| So in addition to just looking at the financial operations and doing a traditional financial audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| to also look at our processes and procedures to make sure that there's an assessment of any potential risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| within those procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| So that's the request, and again, I'm not sure it's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| It's simply a signal that the school board chairman and the school board and the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| are interested in partnering with the county commission in making sure that an audit occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| and making sure that an independent risk review occurs also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| But it's a recognition of your role in directing the work of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Again, going over this, and I will go one more time, we are required, since we've got this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| since it has been brought to our attention, we've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| We can either use an internal audit by this, or it says may appoint a competent auditor to make the examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| So we can do internal or external on this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| I don't think we need to do an external audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| but we are required now that we have this letter before us to take action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I think Dr. McIntyre is a little confused when he didn't hear earlier the fact that the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| in authorizing any audit comes from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| You can ask for them all day long, but if we don't approve it, it don't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| And it seems a little bit like by jumping on the bandwagon second with a good bit of PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3067)|
| 0:51:17| we're going to work with the auditor to determine the scope of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| That's not the way an audit is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| When the auditor comes in and asks for your books, you give her your books and you get out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| You don't try to direct what direction and what books and what closets she looks or he looks under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| So I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Commissioner Strombi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| I agree with this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I think it needs to be done because, one, the audit committee has recommended that it be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| and we've also got the letter from the chairman and from Dr. McIntyre that it be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| I think we need to do it, and I think we need to define the scope of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| It is not just financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| It also looks for policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| and because if we don't define that, she's not going to go and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| She's only going to look for what we tell her to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| So we need to define that, and I say that we take the recommendation that Dr. McIntyre has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| that we also look at the policies and procedures, too, on this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move that we stop the discussion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| If you'll turn your light out, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| We have before us a motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Any opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Before we move away from this item, being as there are a couple of members not with us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| this will be pulled from consent at the regular meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| So please come prepared with any other questions or comments that you might have about this particular audit situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Yes, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| I think it would be probably a good idea to have our auditor here to explain what avenues she might be taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3201)|
| 0:53:33| and asking questions from this body as far as what we want her to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| and do we need to direct her back to the audit committee and have the audit committee do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| But I think we need some give and take with the auditor as far as procedures before we do that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3226)|
| 0:53:57| Continuing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| Item number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| This is a resolution amending the Knox County Commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| to change the meeting times of the commission effective to 4 p.m. for the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| 5 o'clock p.m. for the regularly scheduled monthly commission meetings, legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| and 7 o'clock p.m. for immediately following the legislative session for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| This is resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| That we move without recommendation unless someone wants to speak on this until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Commissioner Olinby, can I do a substitute motion on this that we postpone this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| I will not be present next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| Not that you all matter what I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I don't second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| The substitute motion is before us that it be delayed 30 days or until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| Now then, this needs to be a discussion item then on the Monday meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| This is to be added as a discussion item to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| If it doesn't pass, I guess we'd have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Oh, well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| I should have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| All in favor of a delay until next month meeting, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Now then, back to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| At Monday's commission meeting, so that we will have some preliminary ideas of what people are thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3329)|
| 0:55:37| we can have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Item number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| This is a resolution grant in the city of Knoxville, a permanent greenway easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| temporary construction easement and right of entry within property located 2802 North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| for the furtherance of the city's First Creek Greenway, Edgewood Park and Environs Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| This is resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| I make a motion that we move this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| The motion that's before us is to move on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| This is Commissioner Broyles' issue, and she will be here Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| So the motion is properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3397)|
| 0:56:48| We will now enter discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| This is the report from the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| Report from the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| We had a Cable TV Committee meeting, and it was discussed the contract or lack of one with Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3425)|
| 0:57:16| It's been on a month-to-month for going on nine years now, and there's actually two conflicting contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3436)|
| 0:57:25| one dated 1991 and the other one dated 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| and then there's two amendments to the 2001 contract that, from my understanding, was never implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| so it's kind of confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| But this is to work out an agreement, and to the Cable TV Committee voted to recommend that the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3461)|
| 0:57:52| start negotiations with Comcast to work out a long-term contract with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| and that is the wishes of Comcast as well, that they wish to have a long-term and not a statewide contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| So that was basically there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| and I would like to possibly have the proposal added to Monday's meeting for them to start the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3493)|
| 0:58:22| so we can vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| You put that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| I would like to make a motion that we ask the law department to prepare a resolution for next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| to start negotiations with Comcast on their long-term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| That motion carries, and I guess that was new ground, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3535)|
| 0:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| What just happened is that we had something that was not on the agenda approved by a supermajority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| All in one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| You really need to spin your rules, but since it was a supermajority, I'm not going to fight that war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Do we have other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Plus, this is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| You get a second bite at it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| We also had an item 35 discussion regarding the PPU audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| That will be this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| But we will talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| The reason being is the internal auditor is not present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| I apologize for you all having discussed this twice, but since I won't be here next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| I just wanted to throw some of my viewpoints out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| First, I'd like to thank Andrea and the Internal Audit Department for the work they did on the internal audit of the PPU account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3608)|
| 1:00:20| It was a long time in the making, but they did a good job of pointing out some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| that the school system is going to look at those recommendations and make the necessary changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3628)|
| 1:00:38| to make sure that these errors are corrected for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| There was a couple of things that I did want to point out in the internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| I will note that there was nothing criminal that took place in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| and no one on this body that I know of ever said that there was anything criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| We just said that there was moving of funds, which the audit did show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| that there was money used out of the PPU for other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| and that they'd need to have a better process or a procedure on transferring that money from one to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3675)|
| 1:01:25| It did point out that the land purchase was purchased out of the fiscal plan upgrade of $1.7 million to buy the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3685)|
| 1:01:37| and that was never repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Now, yeah, there was a reason because they bought the land out of that fund before the project was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| but the point is that money was never paid back to that PPU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| So, in essence, the Southwest Elementary, which is now North Shore Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| ran over budget, over $2.5 million over budget when you add those costs in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3719)|
| 1:02:07| And that's the reason that you have a project so that you can manage the money in that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| You know what's coming in. You know what's going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| And when you have it coming out of a couple of different funds, it's hard to keep track of where the money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| And you don't know if you're over budget or on time or over time, so it helps to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| I'm glad that the school system is going to look into soaring up those so that this don't happen again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3750)|
| 1:02:39| and that we make sure that before we approve a project that we don't approve the purchase of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3759)|
| 1:02:50| without having the project already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| And, you know, that happened down at Carter, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| We bought that land 20-something years ago, and we finally used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| But, you know, it helps to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| You know, private sector does it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| They have to keep track of their projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| And if there's any overage or whatever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| they have to come back and ask for more money to cover those overages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| But I just wanted to point out that, I mean, it was a good audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| I wasn't expecting her to find any criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| But when you do move money from fund to fund, there is that chance of impropriety, of having funds misused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3805)|
| 1:03:35| So that's really all the statements I have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| But I want to thank Andrea again for the audit, for doing such a good job and doing this audit for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3820)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Mr. Thomas, do you wish to speak to the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman, if you would permit me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| I'm the one that's the other Bob Thomas, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| not the intelligent, good-looking one that's sitting up here on the commission right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| I'd just like to say on the land purchase, it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| The Board of Education and the county commission approved the land purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| And I'd like to go back a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| We probably have several parcels of property right now that were bought, purchased years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| where a construction project was not set up for those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| Land was purchased for New Gibbs Elementary, I mean, middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| Twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| And so there have been several projects, actually, that have been, that the board has not done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| where land was purchased in terms of getting ready to do those projects at some point later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| But we do agree with the audit and appreciate Andrea working with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| And we do, we always are looking for ways to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| And she found some ways for us to improve, and we plan on implementing those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| And my address, 5325 Beverly Oaks Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| Any further PPU discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| Discussion on the Conner Road Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| I brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| I brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| They're building a new bridge down on Conner Road, and they're making it two lane, where the old bridge is one lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| It's a very sturdy concrete bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| It's one of the very oldest ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| And the community out there wanted to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| And while I'm bringing this up, I need to bring it before the public for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| so we can have the property donated to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| And they will upkeep the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| They want to put a cover over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| They want part of the roads left there so they can have a place to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| but not for cars to get up on the bridge and just put picnic tables on it and people to fish off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| So they want their park out north of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And without costing us anything, we just leave the bridge there and leave the road there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| and give it to the community out there for them to use as their public, little public community area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| And I've already talked to, I guess, Mr. Vandebate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| I don't know if he's still here or not, but I ask him to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| We don't know what's in the contract of where it's to be torn down or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| but it would be a great place for the community out there to have something to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| Mr. Law Director, the discussion that I guess we'd add to this is my first question would be about liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=3996)|
| 1:06:48| as we enter into discussion of what might technically take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Well, I can only address from where Commissioner Bussler is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| but if there is some legal entity out there that the property can be transferred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| then they would assume the liability and everything associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| If it is part of an activity that's going to become a county park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| then it would become part of the park service, meaning the county's park service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| And then we would be assuming, you know, liability and cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| And, of course, any gifts and things they want to do, just like we do at any other recreational activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| they could do and participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| So I guess the answer to the liability comes into the details as they finally appear before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| when and if that time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Yeah, you know, part of my concern would be then I'm assuming that there are county roads leading up to this bridge today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| What would happen to those county roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Where would our liability stop start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| So that was just, again, just as you start your public conversations about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| those are just some of the things that you all may want to start dialoguing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| There was a group of people came up and said that they would like to have the bridge to develop a community park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| And I told them they would have the liability and responsibility if it was given to them by the county to upkeep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| And they told the kind of scope that they wanted to put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| There is a little bit of the road coming to that bridge, but the new bridge is right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| So you're going to use a lot of the road to go to the new bridge, which will be a two-lane bridge instead of a single-lane bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| So all they wanted to do was keep the road that was there for people to park so they could get to that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| but put it up some way to where you could not let cars get up on the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| And they want to put a fence up to keep after a certain time at night, lock it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| and the people out there want to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| So they want to take responsibility of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| If the county wants to donate it to them, I'll get the people up here and the people to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| If and when we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Mr. Chairman, I think in this situation we just need to know how to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| and maybe the law director can say this is what this group needs to do to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| and we let them do that and then we follow through and then we see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Seeing no lights, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Discussion on the best school practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Here I am again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| After the first of the year, I was reading this program that's done in South Carolina on the Best Schools Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| and one of the things they said in here was that from 1999 to 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| they replaced 70 of their schools, either upgraded them or built new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| from 1999 to 2010 when it was finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| And they did it under a certain kind of financing, new modern schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| buildings where you could add on to them, where you could redo them down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| instead of having to build new schools every time that a new program come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| They could redo the interior of the schools and how they built them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| What I would like to do, the commission will allow me to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| and all I want is for you all to pay for the hotel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| I'll be down there two days in January, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| to talk with the school board and see how they did this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| I was reading this thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Does our state constitution set debt limits on school construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| The school, they would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Our constitution leaves it totally to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| And the way Knox County is funding it, we do it through the county commission side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| through bonnet and debtiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| And to the best of my knowledge, I don't know that there's any particular limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| But, you know, that could change every legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| And the other question, this comes up on a lot of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| is why is the county commissioner doing it since he has no authority to recommend schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| to tell how they're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| I mean, you know, it's like a nice curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| but it seems like this is something that the schools ought to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| I mean, this is the schools, because we don't make any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| we don't make recommendations on how they're built, where they're built, when they're built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| what they do with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| But our charge, just to answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| our charge from what I read from this right here, that we fund the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| The funding comes from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| So we're not telling them how to build it, where to build it and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| We're just finding out where the best way and the most bang for our bucks we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| that we're spending county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| So to sit back here and say, well, that's all on their part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| maybe we see a different way or the other, you know, committee, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| the county down there knew how to do something better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| We just got to ask, could we not do it this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I guess I'm sort of, I guess I've been tainted by what happened with the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| with the school at Strawberry Plains is that that had to be, that that was a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| very creative way, you know, that had to be done through the IDB because we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| we, by we, I meant the mayor and the county commission could not build, we can't build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| And so the IDB had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| And then after it was built, the school had the option of either accepting it or refusing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| And, I mean, they could have said we don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| And that's what I mean is that some of that, you know, how we, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| it was a very contentious issue with the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| I mean, that may be something appropriate for the school board to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| but, you know, how we build schools and all is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| My question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Is how do we know that we're getting the most bang for our buck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| We're just giving money out without looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| The people in my district want to know how the money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Well, they have an elected representative on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| I know, but if somebody comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| It's not like, you know, these appointed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| If they have a question, they need to ask their elected representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| the person that they elected to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| But you go out and buy cars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| How do you make a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Do you just go out there and just buy a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| or do you do research on it and see where you get the most bang for your buck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| And that's all I'm saying is I just want to know if we're doing the best we can here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| And if I'm looking inside here, this is the only thing I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| And if I don't look at other people where they're doing a great job at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| how will I know where we're doing the best job here that we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| How do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| How does any of us know unless we take a look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Well, I have a representative that I elected to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| This conversation is at an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Moving along to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Discussion regarding the joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| I'm sorry, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| I thought your light was on for that particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| You'll have extra innings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| This actually dovetails very nicely into that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4459)|
| 1:14:27| We do, you know, as I've said over the years, Commissioner Busley, you know, I'm an advocate of lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| We have lanes and the school board has lanes and the mayor has lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| And I think we need to stick to those lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| But this joint education committee that was formed, Commissioner Wright, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| a couple of years ago maybe, a year and a half, two years ago, was an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| It came out of discord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| It came out of the budget vote where, you know, there was a lot of distrust and angst among both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4495)|
| 1:15:05| An opportunity to have just a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| It was not a decision-making body, but just to have a general dialogue about educational issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4507)|
| 1:15:15| We felt we had something to add to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| They felt misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| So a subset of this body, a subset of the school board members got together monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| and just dialogue about topics of interest, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| that were kind of served as a stumbling block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| Spent a lot of time just talking about how to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I mean, we probably spent three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| This was a facilitated conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| No tax monies were spent, but there was a paid facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| private company paid for a facilitator to kind of get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And this ended, I guess, a little bit before the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| And what we said we would do is we're going to get kind of a new slate of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| new slate of school board members, and we would talk about reconstituting this joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4567)|
| 1:16:19| And so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Do we want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| How do we want this to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| So this was a, in my opinion, let me put a comma there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4583)|
| 1:16:32| And so the thought was initially as issues would come up in a commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| or issues would come up in a school board member that were volatile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| and maybe not all the information was understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| we would kind of put that issue aside and we would bring it to the joint committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| to get more understanding and report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And then if it was still an issue, we would vote on it, you know, up, down, left, or right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| So I think it was a pretty successful process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| At the time it was myself, Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| and Commissioner Burroughs that represented the county commission on the joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| So, again, just for this is a discussion, if this commission's in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4640)|
| 1:17:30| we will probably put together a resolution to ask in the school board if they're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| But, again, this is just an initial spark to see if this body is interested in moving this body forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4657)|
| 1:17:50| I just heard what you said, and I think you're right, the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| So, Commissioner Wright, you may want to put out there what you can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| No, no, no, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| I'm done, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| The formation of the committee as it existed was at the pleasure of the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| and I would like to, as the chairman today, replace that at his pleasure next Monday for continued discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Everyone, well, Commissioner Brown, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| The issue that's being discussed, this is the place to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| Everyone hearing Commissioner McKenzie's comments knows what's before us so that we can discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4708)|
| 1:18:37| and it was a committee that the four members were appointed at the pleasure of the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| and I will leave that with him this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| Two of the four are here today, and in our discussion on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| I would like to have each of the three, if assuming Amy's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| give us a report on what you accomplished during those two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| Is it worth spending the extra time to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Other than sitting around singing Kumbaya, was there anything accomplished in those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| I'd like to see that as part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| We can also call on former Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| He may be somewhere around on the territory come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| If anyone can talk to Commissioner Hammond about it right now, though, and find out his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| Do we have other discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| As a point of personal privilege, my point of personal privilege, I actually have about four things I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| First is the senior citizens picnic that occurred that was sponsored by the Knox County mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| On behalf of the senior citizens that participated, I would say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| The people that were there liked the meal, the social contact, and were appreciative of the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4801)|
| 1:20:10| If it had been a younger crowd, they would have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| But the most spoken to thing that pleased the people the most was especially enjoying the old folks band that played for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4814)|
| 1:20:25| The old folks band that played for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Thank you, Judge Tim Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| Now that we've got on to that, it's sort of like a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| The best way, I think, to attract commissioners is to have a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| I would like to say a special thank you to the clerk of courts today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| Former Commissioner Hammond furnished a meal and a guided tour through his chief deputy of the changes that are taking place in the different courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4847)|
| 1:21:03| And then for the third point, I believe that the chairman's lunch next Monday is being provided by the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4863)|
| 1:21:13| And if anyone is interested in hearing the presentation of the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| you need to be here around 1130 this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| I do have two more things, but I see Commissioner Owenby has no go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Well, the only other two items I had were the finance committee is going to meet immediately in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4889)|
| 1:21:39| The finance committee is getting ready to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| After a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| After a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| And at 4 p.m. there is a committee meeting on ethics appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4905)|
| 1:21:55| That was my last two things. Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Yeah, I'm sorry. I just remembered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Just wanted to let everybody know that this Thursday at West High School at six o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| me and Amy are going to start a series of town hall meetings and everyone's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| It will be sunshine, but it's something that me and Amy came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| And we decided that we'd like to have town meetings, town hall forum meetings in our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| And we're starting in my district at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| And then next month we'll be on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| And the site hasn't been determined yet, but it will probably be in her district in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| So we're inviting everybody out, all the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Anybody wants to come out and ask questions or concerns that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| I'm labeling the odd couple because she's on one side of the spectrum and I'm on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| But we're looking forward to it, and I want to invite everybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Yes, I wanted to let everybody know if you are interested in going in on a table at the Legacy Park luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| that we need to get with Joe Lee and get that organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Some have already. We already have some in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| So anyone that will attend the Legacy Park's luncheon, please let Joe Lee know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=4995)|
| 1:23:23| You can use your matching funds money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| But we need to have 10 to get a full table or else the five of us that are going are going to have to cough up double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5008)|
| 1:23:36| I'm already coughing up double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Commissioner Bussler's my date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| We didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| If there be no further business to come before this work session of Knox County Commission, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5024)|
| 1:24:03| We call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5043)|

| 1:24:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5079)|

| 1:24:58| Drum roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| I'm getting heckled up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| What I'm going to do today is go over a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| We're in the middle of year end, so we're seeing auditors every day and we're preparing our financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| So I'm going to go over a little bit of that as far as very preliminary numbers on a few funds and where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5119)|
| 1:25:31| And then I'll get into some of the revenue that's came in for FY15 because we're closing out 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5131)|
| 1:25:40| So we'll go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| And feel free to stop me at any time with questions that you have and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| We'll start by saying that as we did the budget for FY14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| we had a projected use of fund balance in the general fund of about $2.87 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5155)|
| 1:26:05| We're going to end FY14 with use of fund balance of about $177,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5165)|
| 1:26:14| So a lot better than what we budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| I will tell you that the general fund would have actually have had an increase in fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| or, as some people would like to call it, a surplus or a budget surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| However, there were certain funds that we chose to transfer funds into to make those funds whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| as in governmental law library, solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| And by doing that with solid waste, it also helped engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| And we also had some internal service funds that we placed some money into, being risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5207)|
| 1:26:59| and our employee benefits fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| And also we also had to help out the air quality fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| So if not for those, we would not show a negative as far as the net change in fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5224)|
| 1:27:12| But if you do a percentage of about $167 million compared to what $177,000 is, it's very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5232)|
| 1:27:22| And so taking that a step forward, how that will affect us on our balance sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5242)|
| 1:27:31| total fund balance will go from basically $66,265,000 to basically $66,089,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5251)|
| 1:27:44| However, the breakout of fund balance, the number that we always talk about, unassigned fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5264)|
| 1:27:52| that number actually increased this year from basically 51.4 to 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5272)|
| 1:28:00| And so that's a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| The one that went down was committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| So it's just spending down things that was committed or planned use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5286)|
| 1:28:18| Going on to where we are currently as far as current revenue that's came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| keep in mind that I know we're in October, but basically we've gotten two months' worth of most any revenue that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5304)|
| 1:28:34| It's a timing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| So will tax, as an example, we're about $11,000 behind where we were a year ago on collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5316)|
| 1:28:48| Sales tax has been pretty good, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| Sales tax for the first two months were up about 4% from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| And so we'll continue to watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| We had budgeted a percent increase on sales tax based on a projection at a set point in time as we did the budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5341)|
| 1:29:14| If that trend were to continue of around 4%, that would be very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5354)|
| 1:29:24| The one that's really encouraging is hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| For the first two months of this fiscal year, we are 18% up over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5370)|
| 1:29:38| The first month was about, excuse me, I'm sorry, it was about 24% up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| It was about 32% up for the month of July, about 18% up for the month of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| I think that's about 24% for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| That's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| I mean, you can point to certain events that may could help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| But either way, that is a positive trend that we will look and hope continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| I don't like to call things trends by what's happened in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| But it's something that we can watch and keep up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| We will continue to work with our auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Our plan is to have our annual report done by the week of Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| so I don't have to make my employees work on Thanksgiving and the day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| He's got his head down. He didn't listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Jason's asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| He's asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| But that is a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Every year we have not ran into any roadblocks this year or any unexpected circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| so I don't know why that would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| The auditors so far have not found anything of concern, and we'll continue to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| And after we get done with year end, we'll have a couple of months to get caught up on the current fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| and then we will begin work on the 2016 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| I will answer any type of questions that you have to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Chris, is there any area that gives you concern, anything you see now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| or that you might see in the future that we need to watch out for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| My soapbox, the Hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| The state will talk every year about doing away with the Hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| This is my opinion now, so to take it for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| We have an Amendment 3 on the November ballot, which I think, is it 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| I think it's Amendment 3 that says, should we make state income tax unconstitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| That is 3, correct? I think that's number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| So everybody's going to say, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| We don't want state income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I think that's what will be used as an attempt at some point to do away with the Hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| It will be said that we have passed a constitutional amendment saying that the Hall income tax is just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| and we need to do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| The Hall income tax is a tax on dividends and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| Five-eighths stays with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| We get three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| For us, it's anywhere between $2 million and $3 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| So the state should hold us harmless if and when they do take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| We'll see if they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| I don't think you will hear that conversation as much this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| because if you hear what's being said out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| the $300 million shortfall revenues are not meeting expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5578)|
| 1:33:08| That is one thing that concerns me, because that's not in our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| If they pull that away, how do we make up that $2 million to $3 million in the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5593)|
| 1:33:20| It would be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| It would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| I'm interested to see when we actually get the ñ and we'll have to figure out when it's going to be ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| when we have the impact of the first annexations rolling off, which should be any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5610)|
| 1:33:39| That's going to be a hit on our sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| So that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| It doesn't hit schools, because we give the same percentage to schools as the city of Knoxville does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5625)|
| 1:33:53| and so that won't affect schools, but it will affect general fund and roads and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| So that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| We'll see what that impact is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| Property tax, we always seem to have growth of about a percent and a half every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| We're blessed in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Those are the two things, though, that come to mind that when I think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| We went to Nashville, the mayor and myself, and talked about hall income tax before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| and talked about having to do things on bonds and just say, keep the locals in mind before you make drastic changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5663)|
| 1:34:32| And so we'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| But those are the two things that come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| Anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| This is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| We're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| A financial report by Knox County Schools Superintendent Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5691)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| You should have our Knox County Schools report for the first quarter of fiscal year 15 in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| along with the apple and the book on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| And I'm going to ask our Executive Director of Finance, Ron McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| to walk you through the particulars and address any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| The document you have before you is titled Knox County Schools Financial Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| Our veteran commissioners are aware of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| For our newer commissioners, though, what this report does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| it's a standard financial report that we provide to the commission on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| And so this is the first report for the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| It's for the first three months, July through September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| And what these reports show is a budget to actual comparison in our general purpose fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| That's our general operating fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Between the current fiscal year versus the same time as the previous fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| for both revenue and expenditure categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| And so this particular report shows that after three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| both revenue collections and expenditures appear to be on track for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| as well as compared to the same time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| I can briefly go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| There's really two pages of substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| One page is a revenue sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| The other is an expenditure sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| And so page two in the revenue section is a comparison of collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| And I think it's important to know, especially for our newer commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| I know where, again, our veteran commission knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| but for the Knox County Schools, the operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| there are three main components of revenue that account for about 96% of all of our revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5811)|
| 1:36:59| Three main components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| One is property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| One is sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Those are the local components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And the third is the BEP, the basic education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| That's the state revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| And that normally accounts for about 40%, just that one item alone, about 40% of our revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| So those are the three items that we really closely monitor each year because of their significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| But anyway, on page two, and I'll just kind of go over some of the high spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| On page two of the operating revenue sheet, as of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| we're running at about 11% of budget to actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| And if you look at the prior year, again, that's where we were running, about 11%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| So there's really no surprises there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| And the next page in the expenditure section, page three, there are a list of categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| And I think that what's important is that for the bottom line for all of these categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| we see that spending is really on par with respect to budget and actual this year as compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5881)|
| 1:38:08| I think this year our operating expenditure is roughly about 15% compared to last year at about 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| You'll also notice in some of the categories there may be some differences in percentage spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| Quite often that's just a reflection of timing postings or the timeliness of postings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| And so what happens sometimes in month three for one year, it's posted in month four the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| So what we really want to focus on, at least early in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| is this bottom line total to make sure that we're really not out of sync, so to speak, with the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5916)|
| 1:38:44| So we kind of want to line those up to make sure everything's running according to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| So, again, nothing really unusual with this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| You know, probably it's just kind of a typical accounting boring report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| You know, for accountants, it's kind of what we like when it's boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| So, yeah, nothing really jumps out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| It's three months into the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| We'll be giving another one to you for the next quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| But just, you know, always, too, if a commission ever has any questions, even on these reports or between reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| please feel free to give us a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| And our accounts are also kept on the county's financial system on the Munis report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| So I know Chris could provide any of those reports as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| So, anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| I just kind of wanted to hit the summary for kind of sensitive to our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| If there's any questions, I'll be happy to answer those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| Or if you have some later, please feel free to give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| I may be missing it here, but can you explain down at the bottom of the page on two and three, it says note one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| It gives a definition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| And what does that pertain back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| I don't see it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Oh, it's just a general note, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| So note one is, so on page two, revenue amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| What we wanted to just reflect is that sometimes in the individual line items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| there may be a difference of percentage collected at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| And so what we want to make sure of is that when we look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| that any significant difference, we want to track that down to see what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| And so often it's nothing more than just the timing of a posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| So, for instance, sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| That's normally, when we collect those, that's normally a two or three-month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| because those collections go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Then the state, of course, keeps their share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| They remit the local portion back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| And so sometimes it may be from just one month to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| And so what we're doing is we're trying to take a picture of a specific point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| in this case, September 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| So, for instance, if a particular posting for last year was September 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| but in this year it may be October 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| then that's going to be a variance that would be used specifically for that one particular line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| So we just wanted to put the note there just to capture that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| and let the readers of the document know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| Okay, I always thought when you put that note down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| it referred like note two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| It says operating transfers, see note two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| and you go down to note two and it tells you that's what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| I thought those normally put in there for a specific detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Well, so the reason we didn't for note one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| we wanted to distinguish, we could have just put a general note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| but that particular note could change with respect to each item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| with regards to each individual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| So that's really just an acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| That note one is just to distinguish it between the other two notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| Okay, and then I've got one other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| I'll let you go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| On note two, it says transfer from the county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| It says early literacy, kindergarten intervention, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| Okay, what is et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Yeah, we have for operating transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| sometimes we have transfers within our own funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| So, for instance, the school nutrition fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| reimburses the general purpose budget for a portion of utilities costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| for a portion of their workers' compensation fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| related to the school nutrition employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| the cafeteria workers, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| So there's a few items in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| The reason we put early literacy and kindergarten intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| those are the two really high dollar items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| And so we just wanted to give the readers of the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| an idea of what comprises most of those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6168)|
| 1:42:59| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Yeah, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| What is regular instruction support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| That's going to be instructional support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| that's not necessarily classroom specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| It could be, I need the budget here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| Is that materials or is that people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| It could be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| No, it would include personnel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| So it could be maybe grade level supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| I mean, that's just one of several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| If you go online, you can see our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Knox County Schools budget, and it will give a detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Our budget is probably 900 line items long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| but you can actually go into our budget document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| and there's a specific page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| Our budget is probably 90 something pages maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| So there's a specific page that has regular instruction support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| and so it will give all of the line items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| that are associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| So yeah, it would include personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| There's some teacher's assistance dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| or personnel in that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Also, supplies and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| There may be some allocations in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| I'm trying to do this from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| I'm almost hesitant to say unless I went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| and looked at the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| But anyway, what we try to do is summarize the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| rather than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| It's on your website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| BEP 2.0 has never been fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| What has the administration and the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| what efforts have they made to make this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| And what can we do as a commission to help you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| to make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| I appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Probably our Board members and maybe our legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| could speak a little bit better to that than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| I can tell you probably...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| I believe BEP 2.0, the first and only installment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| was probably six or seven years ago maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| It was about $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| And so the following year is when the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| really began to start to take a dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| And so that second installment never came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| And so, yeah, it would be pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| It would be a big help for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| So we, you know, there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| I can't think of the acronym right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| But there's been, I know from county administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| school board members, our legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| there's been a lot of effort put forward to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| to try to secure those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| I think the problem with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| I'm just speculating on the state's dilemma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| but I think they just felt the pain of the economy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| And so, unfortunately, those funds have never come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| BEP, you know, we took a little bit of a hit this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| And it was totally unexpected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| And to complicate the, or to add to the dilemma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| which is one of the three big components for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| it's really odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| It has just literally leveled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, completely static over a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| I think over the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| it's come in at like 108 point whatever million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| I mean, it's just boom, boom, boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| It's like a flat line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| And so that creates some budget challenges as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| not just the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| but it does for county government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| So, you know, that's just a product of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| And I think the state kind of finds himself in that dilemma as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| Yeah, oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Mr. Chairman, sorry, just to add to that also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| you know, the Board of Education each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| adopts a legislative, a set of legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| And moving to BEP 2.0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| has been a part of those legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| for each of the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| So that is the document that then individual board members use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| for conversations with the legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| when we have interaction with the legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| between the board and the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| That's the document that is discussed and talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| So it's been one of the board's legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| for each of the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| Well, the Board of Education is also part of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| sort of interacts with the larger school districts around the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| through something called the Coalition of Large School Systems, or CLAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| And that's been a push, not only with our Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| but also with Shelby and Hamilton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| and Metro-National Davidson County Schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| And so it pushed real hard to try to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| that our legislative delegation is aware of the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| of moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| And it's been a high priority for the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6464)|
| 1:47:51| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Piggybacking on what Randy said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| is there anything, I guess putting our voice to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| would it help to move this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Because, you know, if we got the state average of the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| we're looking at almost $53 million that we're losing to other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| And that could take care of a lot of our issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| The shortfalls and money that you all want extra money to do stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| If we could do anything to lend that voice to maybe help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| because it's the small counties against the big counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| is what it's boiled down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| In a word, Commissioner, yes, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| I mean, I think the more that we can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| on moving in that direction, the better we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| I think the challenge is, of course, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| that there are 136 districts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| Most of them are small rural districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| And so when you get into a conversation about how do you divide the pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| it is a bit of a challenge to prevail on that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| But if you talk about a decision that's already been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| but that a commitment was made to move in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| I think impressing upon people in the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| that that was a commitment that was already made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| and moving in that direction makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| I think that's more of a winning argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| I also think if we can, as the state has over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| continue to increase the pie rather than fight about how we slice up the pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| I think that's an important dynamic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| And again, I think if the County Commission can join with the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| in that conversation and in that dialogue, I think that would be very powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| Well, and I think that's kind of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| I mean, I understand contributing more to the rural counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| I understand that if we could just make this formula a little bit more fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| and that the major counties were the one that suffers the most out of all those major counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| And I just think it needs to be a little bit more fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| Even if we don't get the whole $52 million, at least we can get half of that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| It would cut down a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| We're just not anywhere near that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| And, I mean, I would be glad to join that and encourage this body to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6629)|
| 1:50:37| Any pressure that we could put on the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| and hopefully we'll have one up there soon that is from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| and will be able to help us in that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| There's a lot of money that we give that we don't get back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| and the formula is not set up fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| On the topic of the BEP, with the shortfall that the state is seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| do you think that's going to have any more downward effect on our funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| If the commissioner, if the BEP continues to, you mean if it can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| State revenues continue to be somewhat $300 million short, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| I'm always real hesitant to speculate with BEP, with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| It's really kind of a complex three-page formula with several different components in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6690)|
| 1:51:39| The one component that is the great unknown every year is this calculator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6699)|
| 1:51:49| or this calculated total called the fiscal capacity index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| And so you can run it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| It's pretty much the same general formula for all districts within the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| except for at the bottom of the formula there's this fiscal capacity index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| and then that kind of really all bets are off at that point because they adjusted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| So that's really the driver that's unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| There's been some years where we really thought there was just not a lot of room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| to receive any money from the BEP, and lo and behold, the state comes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| and it's like, geez, this is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| And then other times you think, since the economy is going along better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| you think you're going to see some significant increases from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| and then they don't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| So it's always a possibility that as long as the thing we look at is when we look at the sales taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6756)|
| 1:52:45| and that illustrates pretty much how the economy has been rolling over the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| So when that flatlines, that concerns us because we're not sure exactly how that would affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| some of the BEP numbers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| I think you raise a very valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| And Mr. Caldwell would certainly know more about this than I, but I haven't seen any hard numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| but I've heard reports that revenues for the state of Tennessee for September were up over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| So that's, if true, encouraging, and we'll have to see what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| But I know Chris probably has much more better information than we do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| On the BEP formula, I was a finance major in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| I don't understand a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| I think it's hard to be a body that regulates it when you don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| Is there anybody besides Dr. Fox that knows this thing that could come help explain it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| Joe Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| Yeah, Joe Sullivan really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| But I can tell you, it's three pages of formulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| I mean, this is, you know, they can finish and you can still not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| I mean, I think I'm being fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| Someone could go through that whole, you know, the whole three pages with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| and you still may not understand it completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| It's complex, but I will say we are fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| I mean, you know, we have folks like Ron McPherson who is a real expert in school finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| who does understand it and can walk you through the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| I mean, the formula is published every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| The components of the formula are published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| The calculation is published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| It's just you do have to know, you just have to understand how it all works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| But, you know, we're fortunate to have someone like Mr. McPherson and Mr. Thomas on our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6866)|
| 1:54:32| who do understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| We also, you know, the folks at the State Department of Education can also be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6873)|
| 1:54:38| in helping people to understand the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| But it is complex, but it is knowable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| and the individual components of the formula are laid out on an annual basis for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| So it is three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| But you can walk through the calculation and see what the numbers look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| and be able to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| You might not agree with all of the components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| And I think where we are today is you talk about BEP 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Well, we went from one methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| We were supposed to transition from one methodology to another methodology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| and there was supposed to be a transition point in the middle where it was 50% of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and 50% of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| That's where we stuck for the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| And so, you know, we were, and I don't know how we get off that dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| And I think it's really, again, up to boards of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| and county commissions to say, look, this is what we were promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| that we would move in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| And moving in this direction is going to be advantageous to the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| And so we'd like to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| But it's going to take a concerted effort on the part of all of us to say, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| this is what was promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| This is the commitment that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| We need to make that transition from one formula to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| Like, you know, and the one thing that Mr. McPherson touched on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| the one aspect of BEP that harms us, every way you want to look at it, it is subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6954)|
| 1:56:03| but that physical capacity, piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| the premise of that is how much can a community afford to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6970)|
| 1:56:18| Is that community taxing itself enough to pay their portion of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6978)|
| 1:56:28| And that hurts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| So, you know, you can argue that, but that's the point or piece of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6990)|
| 1:56:37| So, you know, that's the theoretical premise is somewhere, you know, Huntsville and Scott County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=6997)|
| 1:56:44| hey, there's not a lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| There's unemployment rate, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, their tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| So they maybe should get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| So, you know, so that piece hurts us just by the nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| It hurts urban districts where, you know, the jobs are a little more, a little higher paying, a little more plentiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7020)|
| 1:57:10| And, again, you know, the T word, tax word comes up, should be taking a bigger portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7030)|
| 1:57:20| So, again, it's one of those things where when you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| and CTAS, as you all go to the CTAS meetings, when you look at the tax rate of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7046)|
| 1:57:34| compared to the tax rate of the other counties in the state, we're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7054)|
| 1:57:44| Sam, some of the counties that receive the most PEP money have some of the lowest property tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| And as someone that lives in the city, I pay about 5.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| No, you can't, you don't count city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| I know you can't count it in the formula, but as a taxpayer, I have to count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| No, you can't count city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| I mean, as a commissioner, you should know, anyone, you should know, you can't count city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| You shouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| That's not part of the city's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| As a county commissioner, you should know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| That is not, so you cannot count city tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| So, again, you can't bring apples to an orange fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| So, again, I'm not trying to be argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| I'm trying to state facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| As CTAS, not Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| So if we want to have a dialogue about it, let's have a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| But, you know, don't shoot me down when we're talking about BP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| And if I bring a dissenting point, let's have a dialogue about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7133)|
| 1:59:01| So it's a statement of fact that our tax rate hadn't increased in, I don't know, 11 to 12 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7141)|
| 1:59:10| Or we hadn't had a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| You know, as assessed value goes, the rate goes up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| So that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| And it goes into the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| It's all interconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| So as we dig into it, my only charge to eat all of us is to dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| Yes, we aren't getting our fair share from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| But there's another side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| There's two sides to that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| So, again, as we have these conversations, and no one's asking for an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| That's not what Sam McKenzie's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| But let's dig into it and see where the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| Yes, there's some efficiencies that can be had across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| There's some efficiencies that can be had on this side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| So, again, as we dig into these finances, I just challenge everyone to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7195)|
| 2:00:02| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| You know, I don't want to sound doom and gloom, but if you look at where the money at the state comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| if you take a dollar of state revenues, 53 cents comes from sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7210)|
| 2:00:18| Fifteen cents or percent comes from the franchise and excise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| And then you drop down to the gasoline tax, which is automatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| just about automatically goes to road repairs and the business and insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| or the banking and the insurance is six percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| The point being is that the vast majority of the tax receipts from the state comes from economic activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7235)|
| 2:00:43| I mean, it's sales tax and the business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| And, you know, particularly on the way that things are taxed in the state, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| we do tax goods, you know, which are the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| And what's happened over the last 25 to 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| we've had an inversion to where 60 percent of our economic output was goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| and 40 percent were services and it's flipped around now where we have 60 percent services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| and 40 percent goods as we've become more of a service state and a service nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| And we do not tax services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| And if you're really looking at how that trend's going, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| we're trending more and more toward a service state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| which means that part of the economy that may be growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| I mean, our whole state economy may be growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| We may have more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| We may have a bigger economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| We're not receiving revenue from it as if we were making things because all we tax are goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| The point I'm trying to make is it's sort of grim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| even though Tennessee is going to grow more than most other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| our tax revenues aren't necessarily going to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| And I'll just go ahead and throw this out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Forty-one percent of the budget goes to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| And the next biggest chunk deals with health and human services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| And with all of this talk on Medicare, I mean, it's going to be, if we do have any growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7322)|
| 2:02:09| it's going to all be eaten up, not on Medicare, but on Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| It's all going to be eaten up by health care and there's not going to be any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| I mean, Dr. McIntyre had mentioned he'd like to see the state education budget maybe grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| from that 41 percent to something more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| but it's all being consumed by Medicaid and this talk on Medicaid expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| and just the normal increasing cost of health care there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| So in my mind, it doesn't look good that we're going to see a lot more help from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| I just wanted to throw that out there so people understand what some of the problems are we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7357)|
| 2:02:46| Anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| Thank you for coming, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| As soon as you say this meeting is adjourned, I would say, commissioners, please remain seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| Commissioners, please remain seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| For the purpose of receiving candidates for appointment to the Knox County Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7386)|
| 2:03:15| I call this committee of Knox County Commission into order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7395)|
| 2:03:23| Madam Clerk, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7403)|

| 2:03:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7433)|

| 2:03:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Thank you, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Without objection, I'll operate from this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| The purpose of this meeting is at 4 o'clock to receive in public hearing before this committee of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7450)|
| 2:04:21| applicants for the vacant Knox County Ethics Committee seat as will be before us at full commission meeting as Resolution 1410-110, Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7461)|
| 2:04:39| Are there applicants here present to present their names for appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| If we don't nominate Gerald Witt or Samantha Manning, we're out of luck today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7489)|
| 2:04:58| We've got Mr. Brown over here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| I didn't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| He was back behind my level of vision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| Can we nominate somebody that's not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| We can do that today or we can do that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| While I was getting ready to ask, is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| In answer to Commissioner Owenby's question, do they not have to be present for the interview time to be nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7523)|
| 2:05:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Commission can nominate any person at any time for any position as long as they're present to accept the nomination and be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7536)|
| 2:05:46| Unless they have given in writing in advance that they're willing to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| some way that they have noted they're willing to serve, then anyone can nominate anyone, whether they show today or not, for the positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7551)|
| 2:06:02| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| The reason I bring that up is that I talked to Scott Daniels a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7565)|
| 2:06:12| if he was still interested in serving on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| He apparently hasn't met in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| What hasn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141020?start=7579)|
