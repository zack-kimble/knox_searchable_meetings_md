| 3:09:31| in terms of first making this statement. When I came on to commission in 2016, I met with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11371)|
| 3:09:38| chamber, and my observation to the chamber in 2016 talked about our farmland. That was one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11378)|
| 3:09:46| the primary statements I asked when I came on and I met with the chamber, looking at the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11386)|
| 3:09:53| of agriculture in our farmland and the sustainability of feeding people in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11393)|
| 3:09:59| So I just want to acknowledge in 2016 I made that very observation. The second observation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11399)|
| 3:10:06| regarding Midway Park, which the second biggest issue that was before commission at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11406)|
| 3:10:13| looking at large industrial tracks to make sure we have the available resources for expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11413)|
| 3:10:20| and retention of businesses in this area. And third, I want to say in terms of the growth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11420)|
| 3:10:26| development of our county, especially for people who are seeking employment at that level, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11426)|
| 3:10:33| county still is going to have to deal with how the transportation component from the interior of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11433)|
| 3:10:39| city, so that people can have access to those jobs out there in terms of our boundaries, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11439)|
| 3:10:45| people can have access to CAP and the transportation necessary to fill that area. But I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11445)|
| 3:10:52| acknowledge the spot development, the urbanization in terms of the level of traffic those trucks will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11452)|
| 3:10:58| pull out onto John Sevier, which is a critical component to me. In terms of the viability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11458)|
| 3:11:06| regarding the size of the building, and I agree that your metrics of success should equal more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11466)|
| 3:11:13| than just money, and that we acknowledge that the community does have opposition. And the effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11473)|
| 3:11:20| in terms of the ecosystem, and the compromise in terms of their water quality, and the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11480)|
| 3:11:28| standards, because we want to be good neighbors. We acknowledge that. This is a huge opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11488)|
| 3:11:34| for the county to make sure we acknowledge the needs of what takes place. That was the reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| wanted to hear what the community had to say when they toured your facility. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11499)|
| 3:11:47| Commissioner Carringer. Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| The facility and all is just fabulous, and they do have their act together, and we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11513)|
| 3:12:00| want to keep this company and want to be able for it to expand in Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| And when I make decisions, I try to always incorporate how I feel that the Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11526)|
| 3:12:14| that it is in their district, feels about it. And so I guess I'd like to hear from Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11534)|
| 3:12:22| what his feelings are and how he feels about Fresenius relocating their disposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11542)|
| 3:12:32| center there. So I'd kind of like to know his feelings, because we're not allowed to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| each other, and I haven't heard. So I'd, whenever the appropriate time, I'd like to know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11556)|
| 3:12:42| Commissioner Wright feels about it, because he was elected by the people in this audience and all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11562)|
| 3:12:47| District 8. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess this first question would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11567)|
| 3:12:55| be for Mr. Seymour. Yes, sir. On our tour that we went on Saturday morning, I may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11575)|
| 3:13:07| misunderstood, but I thought that the owner of this property lives on Hammer Road. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11587)|
| 3:13:15| Yes. What's the bells in the chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11595)|
| 3:13:21| What? Who lives over there? Does Tom live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11601)|
| 3:13:29| Okay. Their farm is on Hammer Road. Okay, but they don't have a house that connects the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11609)|
| 3:13:34| off of Hammer or something like that then. Okay, now I may have misunderstood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11614)|
| 3:13:39| I understood that because they're keeping part of the land for farm and housing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11619)|
| 3:13:46| So they have a home there? Yeah. Yeah, Roscoe. Come up here and explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11626)|
| 3:13:57| Come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11637)|
| 3:14:03| I hope I didn't misunderstand what Mr. Sherry and Mr. Bell told me. Okay, I'm Roscoe Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11643)|
| 3:14:11| 842 Kimmel House Road. The property on Hammer Road has two residential houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11651)|
| 3:14:20| The owner's family do not live in these two houses, and there's a house on Roscoe Lane also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11660)|
| 3:14:28| that is a rental house. Okay, thank you. Let's see. The young man that spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11668)|
| 3:14:37| with the, I guess it's a blue striped shirt, I can't tell, yes, beard, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11677)|
| 3:14:41| Quick question for you. You were concerned about the emissions level generated from the 26 trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11681)|
| 3:14:50| that would be on the property there. And my question is, because Hammer Lane basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11690)|
| 3:14:58| dead ends into Interstate 140, would you not perceive that more emissions would be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11698)|
| 3:15:04| from the trucks on Interstate 140 than from a 26 semi and a 24-hour basis coming to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11704)|
| 3:15:15| there? So first off, I am not an expert on this. I have not applied any models, and actually I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11715)|
| 3:15:23| would like to ask a question about that model if you don't mind while we have this exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| So I'm concerned about the additive nature of pollutants. If you look at any one thing in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11728)|
| 3:15:33| society, it's not really affecting people. It's when you have a combined, a concentrated approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11733)|
| 3:15:39| And one other thing about the trucks, yes, right now they're proposing to have 24 to 29 or 28 was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11739)|
| 3:15:48| I think a figure that was thrown out there. However, those things can be amended. That facility can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11748)|
| 3:15:55| support way more truck traffic by design than what they're necessarily using. There are 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11755)|
| 3:16:00| docks on one side and 20 docks on the other. And based on national averages, that could support up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11760)|
| 3:16:06| to 390 truck trips per day. So my concern is maybe not 10 trucks, maybe not 20 trucks combined with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11766)|
| 3:16:13| other increases on John Sevier, but those numbers are going to keep increasing. 350 vehicle trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11773)|
| 3:16:19| per year, it's increasing. So that's 350 per day per year on John Sevier. So that's where my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11779)|
| 3:16:27| comes from. Okay, well then my next question is, did you get a chance to tour the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11787)|
| 3:16:33| on Saturday? So I did visit the facility. I do tour it. I come from a biomedical research background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11793)|
| 3:16:40| and a manufacturing background, so I could pretty much imagine what they had there. And I looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11800)|
| 3:16:44| plans for their manufacturing line. Okay, so with your background, would you not assume then that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11804)|
| 3:16:50| an industry had five different product lines that they were going to have to take from that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11810)|
| 3:16:58| and move it to a warehouse that they would have to have separate doors to isolate those products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11818)|
| 3:17:05| particularly on one of the products that they produce, it has to sit there in that warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11825)|
| 3:17:11| for 21 days before it can be moved? Yes. So if you have like 5,000 of something sitting in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11831)|
| 3:17:19| warehouse for 21 days, it's going to take up a lot of space, but you're not going to have to move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11839)|
| 3:17:25| in and out regularly. And I think that's why there's a smaller number of trucks. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11845)|
| 3:17:32| other, could I just see a show of hands who were there on Saturday for the tour just out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11852)|
| 3:17:40| curiosity that actually went inside the factory and saw it? Okay. And let's see here. Oh, another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11860)|
| 3:17:49| thing, just from a homeowner's side, when I first saw the plans for this warehouse, my concern was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11869)|
| 3:17:59| well, how close are the neighbors? All right. How many of you are familiar with Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11879)|
| 3:18:06| in West Knox County? Okay. Do you know where the Pinnacle Theater is, where the Target store is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11886)|
| 3:18:15| and on that side of Turkey Creek, are you all pretty familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| Did you know behind those things, all those businesses which create a lot of noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11899)|
| 3:18:28| there's a residential neighborhood right back there. And they only have a hundred feet separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11908)|
| 3:18:34| between all of Turkey Creek and their backyards. So my first question was to the architectural firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11914)|
| 3:18:41| was, how close is that outside wall to your back door? And the estimate with most of the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11921)|
| 3:18:50| is in the neighborhood of 500 feet. So I don't think you're going to have a noise issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11930)|
| 3:18:56| with a warehouse when you've got that kind of distance between, plus with the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11936)|
| 3:19:01| buffer as well. Could you comment on the elevation of those buildings relative to those houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11941)|
| 3:19:07| Well, that was the other question, because my question was, if you're on Interstate 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| is this going to tower above Interstate 40? It is not, because it's going to be a lower grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11951)|
| 3:19:16| than Interstate 40. So I'm assuming they're not trying to showcase this. Like when Panasonic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| built on Straw Plains Pike, they wanted to showcase their building, so they put it up close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11962)|
| 3:19:27| high, and with their big logo. But because this is a, my assumption, a secure facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11967)|
| 3:19:35| that they're not going to want to let people know that it's there. And the other question for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11975)|
| 3:19:42| I guess, Dusty was, are you not a FEMA contractor where you have to be ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11982)|
| 3:19:49| at a moment's notice when there is an emergency to provide these medical supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11989)|
| 3:19:55| and that's one of the reasons you want to have the close proximity to the interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| Yes, sir, that is accurate. We do hold product for national disasters around the nation in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11999)|
| 3:20:05| different centers, so if caught upon, we can deliver them for those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12005)|
| 3:20:12| Okay, thank you. That was all the questions I had, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12012)|
| 3:20:16| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12016)|
| 3:20:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank everyone who sent emails, and we do read them. We may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12017)|
| 3:20:23| say thank you on them, but we do read them, I can promise you that. It was mentioned, I'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12023)|
| 3:20:31| off, it was mentioned that we are doing a Governor John Severe Highway corridor study. Let me first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12031)|
| 3:20:38| tell you this, this study is not to limit property owners, so get that completely out of your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| If you own property on Governor John Severe Highway, we're not, this corridor study is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12044)|
| 3:20:48| not to limit your use of your property. That's not what this is all about. The corridor study is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12048)|
| 3:20:54| about taking, looking at Governor John Severe Highway, which is on the west end, which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12054)|
| 3:21:00| scenic highway. The only limitations on a scenic highway is that there's a 1,000 foot buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12060)|
| 3:21:06| no billboards, no junkyards, 35 foot billing height. On the east end of Governor John Severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12066)|
| 3:21:15| Highway, it's considered a parkway, which has different regulations. It is 45 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12075)|
| 3:21:22| billing height. They can go up to 45 foot billing height. We are looking at the corridor study, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| will come before this commission in, I'm guessing, four to five months from now. We are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12088)|
| 3:21:35| limiting signs, the size of the signs, adding more trees, more beautifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12095)|
| 3:21:43| meeting that way. Just because it's a scenic highway or scenic parkway by state regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| don't mean a lot. I just wanted to get that out there about the corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12108)|
| 3:21:53| Mr. Glenn, I got a question. I did not understand when you mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| What did you mean by 35 and 45 foot limit? Could you clarify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12117)|
| 3:22:02| Someone handed me this copy of your corridor study and overview on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12122)|
| 3:22:14| I was looking at the, they had underlined and highlighted the billing height limit to 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12134)|
| 3:22:22| prohibited within 1,000 feet. You have clarified that, that that is to the southwest portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12142)|
| 3:22:32| the eastern portion. The only thing I didn't understand is prohibited within 2,000 feet. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12152)|
| 3:22:38| assume that's advertising and the 45 foot limit. You have clarified that for me. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12158)|
| 3:22:46| Mr. Green, did I state that correctly? Yes, sir, you did. Okay. I've been through a few of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12166)|
| 3:22:53| meetings. Next one, I guess, is for the assistant law director, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12173)|
| 3:23:00| The word spot zoning come up and then spot zoning, we've heard quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12180)|
| 3:23:08| Would you, will you, I'm not verified, will you explain to us what spot zoning consists of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12188)|
| 3:23:16| Spot zoning generally occurs when you have a small piece of property that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12196)|
| 3:23:24| zoned differently than all the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12204)|
| 3:23:27| And so you have a couple of elements there. You got different zoning and you got a small piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| of property. Whether a piece of property is small or not is a facts and circumstances sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12211)|
| 3:23:38| analysis. But if you'll recall, we had the same sort of allegation with the Midway Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12218)|
| 3:23:45| And the 300 acre piece of property, the court threw that out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12225)|
| 3:23:50| this is not a small piece of property. Obviously, this is smaller than the 300 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12230)|
| 3:23:56| At 50, 57 acres. I don't know of a case in Tennessee's history where a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12236)|
| 3:24:05| 57 acres, has been deemed small. But normally where you'll find spot zoning is the smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12245)|
| 3:24:12| pieces of property, you know, 3, 4, 5 acres, 10 acres, maybe. But when you get beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12252)|
| 3:24:21| you're looking at a larger piece of property. So a court is likely to look at this and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12261)|
| 3:24:26| this is not a small piece of property. This is a large piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| so it doesn't meet the element of spot zoning. So I would guess it might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12269)|
| 3:24:36| We, during my tour there, we had talked about, I know, the noise and the light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12276)|
| 3:24:43| and the visibility. I requested from, I guess this question will be to Alicia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12283)|
| 3:24:50| I requested that, one of the things that we were told in the Johnsonville Corridor study is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12290)|
| 3:24:55| we want to limit access, let me rephrase that, TDOT would like to limit access to Governor Johnsonville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12295)|
| 3:25:03| Highway. If you have got a secondary road that leads into the primary road, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12303)|
| 3:25:08| Governor Johnsonville Highway, you must access Governor Johnsonville Highway from your secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12308)|
| 3:25:14| road. And I requested that you look at Roscoe Lane. Can you explain to me why 24 to 28 trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12314)|
| 3:25:26| a day cannot use Roscoe Lane? Yes sir, I can. I took your recommendation and Becky Bottoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12326)|
| 3:25:33| with Cannon & Cannon completed our original TIS report that showed the truck access on John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12333)|
| 3:25:39| Sevier and then the car access on Roscoe. And once we had our tour together, we called them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12339)|
| 3:25:46| asked them to run a second traffic impact study to look at if we had an opportunity to condense that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12346)|
| 3:25:53| And I've got their conclusions and recommendations and ultimately, and I can read you item number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12353)|
| 3:26:00| it is recommended that sign access alternate, which would be to combine the two side entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| not be implemented, but to keep it separated. This is considered important as the truck's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12365)|
| 3:26:12| access should be provided at a location where more site distance is available and attainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12372)|
| 3:26:17| and it just wasn't available at Roscoe Lane. We did have some recommendations that we needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12377)|
| 3:26:23| clear some vegetation. We could do some things to improve Roscoe Lane, but just due to the height of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12383)|
| 3:26:29| the trucks and the amount of site distance that they felt like it was less than adequate. They did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12389)|
| 3:26:35| however, recommend to us that we provide a desaling for our access on John Sevier. It was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12395)|
| 3:26:42| required as part of the TIS report, but it was recommended to improve the safety. And based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12402)|
| 3:26:47| the recommendations of Knox County Engineering, Cameron Parker with TDOT, each of those entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12407)|
| 3:26:54| plus MPC has reviewed that with our use on review application, and that's the recommendation we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12414)|
| 3:27:00| been provided. So we did look into those efforts and see if that was a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12420)|
| 3:27:05| and Fresenius was open to that, but just due to the existing conditions and based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12425)|
| 3:27:11| engineering report, it just wasn't feasible. But we are going to enhance John Sevier with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| desaling to make it as safe and efficient as we can. I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12436)|
| 3:27:23| It does, but it doesn't. In my mind, we already got Roscoe Lane, and I cannot see why we could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12443)|
| 3:27:34| use Roscoe Lane when today a tractor-trailer, it's a public road access, they've got the right to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12454)|
| 3:27:41| down that road. Now who says, is it TDOT or MPC, who says that you can't use Roscoe Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12461)|
| 3:27:50| That's a good question. I don't know if Ms. Pionke wants to address it, but ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12470)|
| 3:27:56| we have three review entities that are looking at this, and again, we've just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12476)|
| 3:28:02| been through an initial use on review, and that's based on those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12482)|
| 3:28:09| Sydney Pionke, 205 West Baxter Avenue. The traffic impact study was submitted because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12489)|
| 3:28:17| we have the concept plan or use on review in front of us coming up, and all the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12497)|
| 3:28:24| that reviewed the study, we all review it independently, and then we all get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12504)|
| 3:28:28| and meet and discuss what the outcomes are of the study, and it was unanimous by all the reviewers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12508)|
| 3:28:34| that the access should be separated. The best thing that could happen is to keep the trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12514)|
| 3:28:39| separated from the cars. You have a differential in speeds and things that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12519)|
| 3:28:45| and in cases in particularly with industrial parks, you've got people that are, if they punch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| a clock in particular, you have people trying to get in or get out of work quickly, and if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12531)|
| 3:28:58| trucks moving slowly and somebody's trying to be in a rush to get to work, it doesn't work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12538)|
| 3:29:04| Anytime you have speed differentials, that's a concern, so we always try to look to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12544)|
| 3:29:10| the trucks from the cars when possible, and we felt that doing so on Roscoe Lane for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12550)|
| 3:29:17| and having a separate entrance for the trucks on John Svear was in the best interest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| everyone. Is that a requirement? Would that be a requirement on use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12563)|
| 3:29:30| I believe it would be, yes, because it would be part of the site plan in terms of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12570)|
| 3:29:35| Both access points are gated as well, so obviously they'll have their employees go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12575)|
| 3:29:40| and use the Roscoe Lane access for the employees, and then only the trucks, once again, will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12580)|
| 3:29:46| have a gated access point off of Governor John Svear Highway, so it will help keep them separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12586)|
| 3:29:56| Okay. I guess a question to Mr. Seymour, and he can guide it to whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12596)|
| 3:30:02| We talk about ag. It is zoned ag now. Is this land being used as farmland now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12602)|
| 3:30:12| Yes, there's actually a piece of it zoned CA, Commercial A, up against the interstate. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| been used for pasturing. Is that what you all are using it for, pasturing cattle now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12617)|
| 3:30:25| So in the past it's been ag. It's kind of hard to me to look and say that this is spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12625)|
| 3:30:34| because to me spot zoning would be in that residential neighborhood right in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12634)|
| 3:30:39| of it. Someone's got two acres and a convenience store wants to come there in the middle of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12639)|
| 3:30:45| residential area and put a commercial convenience store there. That would be, to me, spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12645)|
| 3:30:54| Being close to the interstate and being some commercial, you know, I don't consider this spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12654)|
| 3:31:01| zoning. So thank you for your time and your efforts, and I'll turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12661)|
| 3:31:08| Commissioner Anders. Yeah, Ms. McCauley, if you don't mind. The pictures of elevation that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12668)|
| 3:31:14| sent us today, and one of them says view at 6109 Hammer Road. Yes, sir. So am I supposed to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12674)|
| 3:31:20| behind the home and that's what they're going to see? That was the goal. We had a request from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12680)|
| 3:31:25| MPC during our use on review was to do our best attempt at trying to look at site views, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12685)|
| 3:31:33| from Hammer Road, but from John Sevier, from the interstate. Obviously we're in a bit of a balancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12693)|
| 3:31:39| act here. I'm trying to make sure that our finished floor elevation doesn't put anyone, you know, in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12699)|
| 3:31:46| adverse impact. So those renderings were taken from Google mapping, essentially. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12706)|
| 3:31:53| piece of software that we incorporate our site survey. So obviously we've surveyed our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12713)|
| 3:32:00| and some of the surrounding roadways, but we have not obviously surveyed the entire neighborhood. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12720)|
| 3:32:08| it incorporates that. That gives us, I'll say, the best possible view. And for us, the goal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12728)|
| 3:32:15| that was to try to, if I'm a resident on Hammer Road, I know the concern is site view, site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12735)|
| 3:32:23| visibility. And so for us, it was how can we apply that landscape screen in the right area with a max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12743)|
| 3:32:29| growth, and then we are restricted by our building height. So it was trying to adjust that finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12749)|
| 3:32:35| floor to where we could get it at a level where the site obviously still ties in the way it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| to, but as low as it could be, you know, given the conditions we've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12761)|
| 3:32:47| Okay. Going back to the pictures from today, looking at the, just one of the drawings, how far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12767)|
| 3:32:55| off, so from the creek, how far, where does the berm start on the creek side, or is there a berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12775)|
| 3:33:05| on the creek side? So the existing vegetation for the creek obviously has to remain. So we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12785)|
| 3:33:11| that 50-foot stream buffer that we have to maintain. We took a measurement from the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12791)|
| 3:33:16| line of the creek, which is essentially the property line, to the edge of our pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12796)|
| 3:33:21| Pavement is roughly 200 feet, and then by the time you get back up to the building, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| you're upwards of 400, 500 feet. All right. When you say get back up to the building, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| building above the creek or below the creek? It's above the creek, sir. Okay. And is the 15-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12810)|
| 3:33:36| berm going to be built between the creek and the parking lot? Yes, sir. Okay. Is it, and I guess on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12816)|
| 3:33:42| John Saffir's side as well, just not the interstate side? Correct. Any adjoining parcel that is of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12822)|
| 3:33:49| residential use now has that 15-foot screen. And what, and what do you, is that 15 foot of dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12829)|
| 3:33:56| or is that 15 foot of dirt and trees? Dirt and trees, sir. So it's dirt, 15 foot of dirt, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12836)|
| 3:34:01| then we plant trees. Well, no, sorry, 15 foot. When I say 15 foot, I mean 15 foot wide. I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12841)|
| 3:34:07| not like 15 foot. How tall are we going? How tall are we going, and what kind of trees are we planting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12847)|
| 3:34:11| If you look at the landscaping plan, which my other, we use the MPC recommendation for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12851)|
| 3:34:19| type A dense screening. I don't know if you're. Is that the heaviest, that's the heaviest density? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12859)|
| 3:34:23| the heaviest option that we could have chosen. So it's, like I said, it's 15 feet in width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12863)|
| 3:34:29| and then as far as the screen, it requires offsets of evergreen canopy trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12869)|
| 3:34:37| I found it, okay. You got it, okay. Yeah, thank you. I have a copy if you, if you need. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| So that was the recommendation, and in addition to that, MPC staff also asked that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12881)|
| 3:34:48| screen the building facade, break the building facade up, so we've added some more in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12888)|
| 3:34:54| to those comments as well. Next question is for Arthur, if I could have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12894)|
| 3:34:59| You may. Thank you. Arthur. Yes, sir. All right, we're talking about Roscoe Lane, and we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12899)|
| 3:35:05| about the 100 or so cars a day in and out on Roscoe Lane, which would be a couple hundred trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12905)|
| 3:35:13| Now, I'm going to go ahead, and I don't limb here, and say that Roscoe Lane is probably not on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12913)|
| 3:35:17| priority list for improvements. What is, if approved, what is Fresenius going to do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12917)|
| 3:35:23| improve Roscoe Lane? Because Knox County has no desire to improve Roscoe Lane, I am. We've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12923)|
| 3:35:29| discussed that. It's obviously going to have to be repaid. Knox County has not kept Roscoe Lane up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12929)|
| 3:35:34| as you well know. It's not in the 75-year plan. It's on our 28,000-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12934)|
| 3:35:41| I think you're getting to it in two more centuries. Right. It's part of our requirements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12941)|

| 3:35:59| Thank you. Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and that was part of my question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12959)|
| 3:36:06| Roscoe Lane, but could somebody just go over the impact on John Sevier Highway and the trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12966)|
| 3:36:13| turning in and out? I'm looking at your drawings and I just must have missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12973)|
| 3:36:21| the changes that will impact that with the level of traffic. I just need somebody just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| clear it up, looking at the picture of this. I'm a little confused. Absolutely. And I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12986)|
| 3:36:32| the scale of those drawings isn't great, trying to get all that property in there. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12992)|
| 3:36:38| TDOT recommended to us, you know, on John Sevier, we had a minimum recommendation from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=12998)|
| 3:36:44| to have 75 feet of storage. Right. Okay. And then 100 foot of taper. TDOT asked for a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13004)|
| 3:36:50| more than that. So as far as what the improvements would be, we're going to revise the guardrail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13010)|
| 3:36:57| provide 100 foot, 150 foot, I think, of taper, and then 100 foot of storage just for that truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13017)|
| 3:37:05| obviously to have time to move, desail, and then turn. And as far as the truck traffic goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13025)|
| 3:37:10| a lot of this traffic is already on John Sevier. You know, we're already making movements on John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13030)|
| 3:37:17| Sevier based on the manufacturing facility. So I know the part of the truck traffic is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13037)|
| 3:37:23| that's already really being implemented in John Sevier. It's just we're creating a stop for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13043)|
| 3:37:30| Thank you. I have a question for Gerald Green. Yes, sir. Gerald, I understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13050)|
| 3:37:39| when the public sees a facility to this side, they think there has to be massive activity going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13059)|
| 3:37:45| But, and there's been talk about lot industrial, plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13065)|
| 3:37:51| The process in which they make this product, it has a resting period. In some ways, I see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13071)|
| 3:37:58| more as not a warehouse, but a storage facility. Would that be a fair statement? That's fair given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13078)|
| 3:38:05| the amount of time that the material has to remain at this location before it can be shipped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13085)|
| 3:38:10| And again, I refer back to the truck traffic that will be generated. 28 trucks a day is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13090)|
| 3:38:19| I would hazard to say that there are days when there are more semis coming to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13099)|
| 3:38:23| a large commercial site loading and unloading than that. Again, what we're to address with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13103)|
| 3:38:31| the zoning is looking at the impact and not the size of the facility, the impact and the use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13111)|
| 3:38:38| the facility. Commissioner Ryan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What we're faced with right at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13118)|
| 3:38:51| moment is not a part of the commission meeting. This is zoning. This is not making policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13131)|
| 3:39:00| This is a fairly well-constrained process. We had time limits on people making presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13140)|
| 3:39:09| We moved into commissioners asking questions of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13149)|
| 3:39:13| This past week I met with Jerry Glenn. That same morning I met with, I happened to be at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13153)|
| 3:39:22| retiree's breakfast, and one of my fellow retirees from the telephone industry was there. We conversed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13162)|
| 3:39:34| about the problems that are facing Knox County due to this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13174)|
| 3:39:43| Normally what takes place right at this moment is for someone to make an affirmative or a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13183)|
| 3:39:52| motion to affirm the action of MPC. I can't make an affirmative action motion, nor can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13192)|
| 3:40:02| be the swing vote to approve this zoning. Excuse me, this is sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13202)|
| 3:40:15| Commissioner Nystrom. I'll make a motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13215)|
| 3:40:27| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13227)|
| 3:40:31| We'll do a roll call vote. Can we explain to those in the audience that have not been through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13231)|
| 3:40:36| before? This is the first part of the process. There's a whole new vote after this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13236)|
| 3:40:42| So this is simply on the sector plan. The zoning will be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13242)|

| 3:41:34| Commissioner Carringer votes aye. Commissioner Wright, do you wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13294)|
| 3:41:43| The people that I represent in the 8th district now have seen a unanimous, almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13303)|
| 3:41:54| vote to approve this sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13314)|
| 3:42:00| I find myself in a box because I was not able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13320)|
| 3:42:07| because I didn't know how Commission would react to this particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13327)|
| 3:42:14| Way back when Commission was big and a lot of people were quoted in the newspapers about Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13334)|
| 3:42:24| Road, I was able to get five or so qualifiers on what was proposed as an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13344)|
| 3:42:36| for example, changed into a business park and what was going to be a 200-acre flat piece of ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13356)|
| 3:42:48| moved into an arrangement of more of a college campus setting for a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13368)|
| 3:42:57| I was unable to have that kind of conversation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13377)|
| 3:43:03| because I didn't know where we were headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13383)|
| 3:43:06| Since my fellow commissioners so strongly believe in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13386)|
| 3:43:17| I would wish to change my vote to a yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13397)|

| 3:43:56| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr. I am here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13436)|
| 3:44:01| applicant, 550 West Main Avenue. Okay. Is the opposition here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13441)|
| 3:44:13| Mr. Chairman, I'm Bill Patey, attorney. I represent the opposition. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13453)|
| 3:44:20| Can we get the report for the M.P.C. staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13460)|
| 3:44:22| No, sir. Mr. Chair, members of the Commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 8-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13462)|
| 3:44:27| to recommend approval of the requested planned commercial zoning for the property. The Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13467)|
| 3:44:32| found that the development as permitted by the recommended planned commercial zoning would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13472)|
| 3:44:37| appropriate. The topography of the property and its access to good roadway system make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13477)|
| 3:44:43| amenable to development with few adverse impacts. Any impacts of development can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13483)|
| 3:44:49| addressed during the planned review process, which is a requirement of the planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13489)|
| 3:44:57| Would the applicant like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13497)|
| 3:45:02| Yes, sir. Again, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, here on behalf of Fresenius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13502)|
| 3:45:12| The planned commercial zoning that we are requesting was, the application for that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13512)|
| 3:45:20| after extensive discussions with the Metropolitan Planning staff and the building officials to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13520)|
| 3:45:27| ensure that this proposed use of a warehouse for this property was consistent with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13527)|
| 3:45:37| zoning ordinance, consistent with the use and the description thereof. As Mr. Green has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13537)|
| 3:45:45| explained, although it is a big warehouse, it is not a heavy industry or even light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13545)|
| 3:45:56| It is a commercial district. We're asking for this zoning, and one thing M.P.C. told me early on was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13556)|
| 3:46:03| that if the use of this building was ever changed, it would have to come back to M.P.C. for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13563)|
| 3:46:15| and a use on review, and if the new use was not planned commercial, it could not be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13575)|
| 3:46:23| for this property. So that was one of the controls that M.P.C. wanted on the property, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13583)|
| 3:46:29| one of the controls or reasons we asked for the planned commercial. As a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13589)|
| 3:46:37| C.B. zoning would apparently allow this use for this property. C.B. is an unplanned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13597)|
| 3:46:48| M.P.C. asked us not to apply for an unplanned zone, and Fresenius was very happy to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13608)|
| 3:46:57| with or comply with the recommendations of M.P.C. to apply for a planned commercial zone that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13617)|
| 3:47:04| allow M.P.C. review and county engineering review, TDOT review, and a number of other agency reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13624)|
| 3:47:15| of the project, and that is what we have done. Also, if the use changed in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13635)|
| 3:47:24| the use would have to come back before the M.P.C., and if it was not consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13644)|
| 3:47:30| planned commercial zone, it would not be approved. So that's why we're asking for the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13650)|
| 3:47:37| commercial zone. Again, Mr. Dusty Irwin may want to fill in some things, and Alicia McCauley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13657)|
| 3:47:46| We are working very hard, as Alicia and Dusty have demonstrated, with TDOT and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13666)|
| 3:47:57| other agencies to make this the finest warehouse facility and Fresenius the finest industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13677)|
| 3:48:05| and business that Knox County has attracted in a long time. Fresenius is proud of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13685)|
| 3:48:13| They're proud of what they do. They provide health care for millions of people in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13693)|
| 3:48:20| and I think maybe Mr. Irwin would like to explain that to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13700)|
| 3:48:25| and that's why we're asking that you all approve the planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13705)|
| 3:48:32| Thank you, Commissioners, for the opportunity to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13712)|
| 3:48:37| I think it might be helpful if we described our manufacturing process, the flow for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| facility. Typically, our process flow is to bring raw materials into the facility on National Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13722)|
| 3:48:51| where we house those raw materials until we absorb them very quickly into our production plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13731)|
| 3:49:00| Upon completion of manufacture, once we have this warehouse facility, we will deliver directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13740)|
| 3:49:07| to that. We'll house very, very little, maybe samples, but otherwise these products will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13747)|
| 3:49:13| directly to the facility to be held for release. Some always will be held for that case that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13753)|
| 3:49:22| spoke to, that disaster scenario that at times does occur. There was a question about the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13762)|
| 3:49:32| of the facility, and would it look like a compound? I think the response would be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13772)|
| 3:49:40| Most of the security is in the building perimeter itself, although we do have a secondary fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13780)|
| 3:49:45| We don't put razor wire or any such things on our facility. It's mostly access control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13785)|
| 3:49:54| and as you know, these days a lot of access control, as with our facility, is with badges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13794)|
| 3:50:00| through the door and then into appropriate areas of the facility as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13800)|
| 3:50:05| So I'd like to just reiterate that this site, this warehouse and shipping facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13805)|
| 3:50:13| are privately owned. They're pharmaceutical products that are held there. We don't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| narcotics or anything. It's for dialysis product. It is a very secure facility as described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13818)|
| 3:50:27| and we take great pride in, as a pharmaceutical provider, a company that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13827)|
| 3:50:33| cares about appearances and cleanliness and order, that an FDA facility also has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13833)|
| 3:50:40| high requirements upon us, and we sustain and maintain those requirements at the highest level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13840)|
| 3:50:45| for this industry. Fresenius is an anchor industry for Knox County, for this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13845)|
| 3:50:52| There aren't very many large manufacturing pharmaceutical companies in this region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13852)|
| 3:50:58| and we do our best to develop and maintain our supply chains in this area. To the example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13858)|
| 3:51:06| of pallets and cardboard boxes, if you can calculate the amount of product we build on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13866)|
| 3:51:14| daily basis, the amounts of these materials that we source locally and use in our product stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13874)|
| 3:51:23| are significant for the economy of Knox County in many ways. So not only do we create hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13883)|
| 3:51:29| of jobs, both at our factory and at the distribution center, that compounds itself in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13889)|
| 3:51:35| our economy in a like manner. That's really all I have to say at this time. If you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13895)|
| 3:51:43| I'll be glad to respond to them. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13903)|
| 3:51:50| I'll just reiterate what you've heard before. NBI, of course, is continuing to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13910)|
| 3:51:56| NPC staff for our use on review. We've been through our initial review and had our comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13916)|
| 3:52:03| issued. Our plan is to revise those for tomorrow, and of course, being at the PC1, that extra level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13923)|
| 3:52:12| of landscaping, lighting, just that extra step of review is what we're working with staff to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13932)|
| 3:52:18| sure our plans go above and beyond the traditional codes and comply with all of their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13938)|
| 3:52:25| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13945)|
| 3:52:30| The opposition's turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13950)|
| 3:52:31| Hello, it's Kyle Rowe, 6516 Pine Grove Road. Everything I said before stands. I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13951)|
| 3:52:47| question still about the modeling that was presented earlier. Was that the move model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13967)|
| 3:52:54| No, but that's the more recent one though, right? The move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13974)|
| 3:52:57| We can't hear you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13977)|
| 3:53:05| The model that I used was based off of the moves emission factors developed in the moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13985)|
| 3:53:12| modeling platform. I can show you the model and everything if you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13992)|
| 3:53:19| I would love to take a look at that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| No problem. I'll send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14000)|
| 3:53:22| Okay, awesome. Can you comment on your error and standard deviation with that model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14002)|
| 3:53:31| I can't comment that because EPA is the one that does the research and puts all the emission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14011)|
| 3:53:37| factors into it. This is the model we have to do for our emission inventories and also do our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14017)|
| 3:53:42| modeling for the regions for our non-attainment demonstrations when we were non-attainment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14022)|
| 3:53:47| various other aspects of what we're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14027)|
| 3:53:51| And so does that use local sampling data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| It does. I'm sorry, you guys aren't speaking into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14033)|
| 3:53:56| I'm sorry, I asked if that used local sampling data from the specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14036)|
| 3:54:01| We get inputs from the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14041)|
| 3:54:06| I'm sorry guys, you'll have to have this conversation afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14046)|
| 3:54:10| This conversation is an outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| It's an outlier? Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14052)|
| 3:54:16| Yes, I guess the other thing I'd like to bring up is speed differentials was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14056)|
| 3:54:25| I'm not 100% certain what the actual speed limit on Roscoe Lane is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| but I'm guessing it's lower than John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14068)|
| 3:54:31| And I don't know what their speed limits are and their facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14071)|
| 3:54:34| but basic math would dictate that in order it should go facility Roscoe Lane to John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14074)|
| 3:54:39| Sevier which is something I wanted to point out since speed differential with clock punchers was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14079)|
| 3:54:44| an apparent issue, some food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| Really this is, you know, it's, Fresenius is a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14088)|
| 3:54:53| You know, yes, they offer a product that is life-saving and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14093)|
| 3:54:58| That's an awesome business area in which to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14098)|
| 3:55:01| Now they are a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14101)|
| 3:55:03| Fresenius is a 33 plus billion dollar a year revenue business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14103)|
| 3:55:09| It's quite considerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14109)|
| 3:55:10| Yes, and they do bring a lot of resources to the area and we're appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14110)|
| 3:55:13| They, sorry, the issue is not with them and their manufacturing practices or this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14113)|
| 3:55:26| It sounds lovely and it would look great in a park designed for buildings of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14126)|
| 3:55:33| This is Amazon level size that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14133)|
| 3:55:38| This is being placed directly in the middle of a rural agricultural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14138)|
| 3:55:44| This is going to directly affect home values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14144)|
| 3:55:47| Certainly another homeowner is going to devalue, but a potential business might value that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14147)|
| 3:55:53| property as being more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14153)|
| 3:55:55| It is agricultural land and one of you stated that this isn't spot zoning because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14155)|
| 3:56:00| size of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14160)|
| 3:56:01| All of the properties over there, this is multiple tracks, are large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14161)|
| 3:56:05| This is an inexorable advance of industry and distribution and warehousing on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14165)|
| 3:56:13| It is a good area, but that's the area in which the community lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14173)|
| 3:56:17| Good people, hardworking people that have land, that have families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14177)|
| 3:56:22| The reason that the speed differential was an issue is because it's dangerous to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14182)|
| 3:56:26| large trucks around cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14186)|
| 3:56:29| I mean, it was stated that that is the issue and that is omnipresent with this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14189)|
| 3:56:36| Now, if you had a light, you had some sort of programmatic way to get these vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14196)|
| 3:56:43| onto the road, okay, that sounds better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| That's what we do everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| That's why intersections have some method of regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14207)|
| 3:56:50| That spot on John Sevier does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14210)|
| 3:56:53| In addition to this, sorry, yes, the truck traffic, the numbers we were given, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14213)|
| 3:57:07| is, there are some assumptions made here, the numbers we were given on our tour at full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14227)|
| 3:57:11| production, their line will generate, will create, I believe it's four pallets every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14231)|
| 3:57:21| 10 minutes, so a pallet every two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| Based on rough estimates, a standard pallet size, which is 40 inches by 48 inches in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14243)|
| 3:57:28| WB50 truck, which they're planning on using, which has an interior height of about 109| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14248)|
| 3:57:32| inches since it's a wedge-type shape, would generously, or I should say conservatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14252)|
| 3:57:39| generously produce 80 truck trips per day, but conservatively, roughly 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14259)|
| 3:57:43| Now, it's assuming full operation, so maybe someone can comment on that and the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14263)|
| 3:57:48| number of product that they're going to be listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14268)|
| 3:57:50| That figure is roughly double what has been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14270)|
| 3:57:53| One, I'm concerned about that, that the generation, the creation of this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14273)|
| 3:57:58| has seemingly been a very easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14278)|
| 3:58:00| So what happens when that facility is built and sitting empty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14280)|
| 3:58:04| How easy will it be for a larger company to come in and use that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14284)|
| 3:58:08| How easy will it be to make that next logical step to say, well, the facility's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14288)|
| 3:58:13| Some people have been moving out, so you don't quite have the residential issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14293)|
| 3:58:18| Sure, we could do 100 trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14298)|
| 3:58:20| We just did a new surface course of pavement on John Sevier, so that could support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14300)|
| 3:58:24| Where does that stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14304)|
| 3:58:26| This really is going to be the beginning of the end for the people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14306)|
| 3:58:36| Not this month, not next year, but the process will be started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14316)|
| 3:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14321)|
| 3:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14322)|
| 3:58:47| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14327)|
| 3:58:56| Bill Petty again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14336)|
| 3:59:03| I'm amazed to hear that they're going to have 28 trucks per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14343)|
| 3:59:10| with a 600,000 square foot facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14350)|
| 3:59:14| That's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14354)|
| 3:59:17| Also, you might be interested to know that Roscoe Lane is a school bus stop area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14357)|
| 3:59:26| You've heard these people, the neighbors, tell you the issues that they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14366)|
| 3:59:32| And I realize this is apparently a great company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14372)|
| 3:59:34| I have nothing against them, but I just feel that what they have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14374)|
| 3:59:41| that what they have asked for ought to be in an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14381)|
| 3:59:47| not out there in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14387)|
| 3:59:50| And they've applied for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14390)|
| 3:59:54| Maybe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14394)|
| 3:59:55| Maybe that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14395)|
| 3:59:56| I find it extremely difficult to understand how you can have a 600,000 square foot facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14396)|
| 4:00:02| that is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| It's general industrial, processing, storage, packaging, wholesaling, distribution, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14404)|
| 4:00:16| And as I said before, planned commercial uses permitted include office, commercial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14416)|
| 4:00:23| and light distribution centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14423)|
| 4:00:28| It doesn't make sense to me, but I'm not too smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| But it just raises questions, serious questions on both points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14430)|
| 4:00:38| And I would respectfully ask that you deny it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14438)|
| 4:00:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14443)|
| 4:00:47| Commissioner, is there any further testimony from either side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14447)|
| 4:00:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14452)|
| 4:00:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14454)|
| 4:00:55| This question is for Mr. Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14455)|
| 4:01:01| Did you participate in the plant tour on Saturday at Fersenius?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14461)|
| 4:01:10| I'm glad you had the same problem I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14472)|
| 4:01:13| So you really don't have an idea of what they actually produce and do at that facility then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14473)|
| 4:01:19| No, as I told you, I don't disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14479)|
| 4:01:23| I'm tickled to death we've got that type of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14483)|
| 4:01:26| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14486)|
| 4:01:27| We need it, but I don't think you need it out there where they're asking you to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14487)|
| 4:01:31| Are you familiar with the intersection of Hammer Road and John Sevier Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14491)|
| 4:01:36| Generally speaking, I don't live in that part of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14496)|
| 4:01:39| and I don't travel that very frequently, but I do go out there occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| Okay, what's across the street at the intersection of Hammer Road and John Sevier Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14502)|
| 4:01:49| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14509)|
| 4:01:50| Would you ask the gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14510)|
| 4:01:53| Does anybody know, is that not a commercial business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14513)|
| 4:01:56| No, that's where people go to go fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14516)|
| 4:02:00| It's the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14520)|
| 4:02:03| So it's not, it's a community center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14523)|
| 4:02:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14527)|
| 4:02:13| It's a metal building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14533)|
| 4:02:16| It was permitted as a barn and built as a barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14536)|
| 4:02:19| It has a bale of hay and a tractor in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14539)|
| 4:02:22| Okay, so it's not actually a commercial business then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14542)|
| 4:02:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14545)|
| 4:02:29| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| Yeah, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14553)|
| 4:02:34| I was looking at the results of the meeting, and I didn't see any conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14554)|
| 4:02:42| You know, some of the stuff that concerns me a little bit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14562)|
| 4:02:45| is type A screening going to be a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14565)|
| 4:02:47| I mean, I didn't see any of that usually listed in here, and I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14567)|
| 4:02:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14571)|
| 4:02:51| We're trying to get away from conditions since they're confounding sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14571)|
| 4:02:58| and with this being a planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14578)|
| 4:03:01| we can address all those without conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14581)|
| 4:03:04| I've taken notes on the issues that have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14584)|
| 4:03:07| as you heard from the staff, MBI staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14587)|
| 4:03:12| In their preliminary plan, they've addressed lighting, access, buffer, building design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14592)|
| 4:03:19| They have listened to the concerns of the community also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14599)|
| 4:03:22| With that checkpoint of the planned commercial and the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14602)|
| 4:03:26| MPC, both the staff and the commissioners felt they could address the issues and the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14606)|
| 4:03:31| at that point without trying to name them as part and attach them as conditions to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14611)|
| 4:03:36| Do they, so they go into the conditions of the planned commercial on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14616)|
| 4:03:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14621)|
| 4:03:41| So they have to do what's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14621)|
| 4:03:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14624)|
| 4:03:47| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14629)|
| 4:03:51| Back to the MBI design, and the lighting is all down lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14631)|
| 4:03:57| It's, as you said, it doesn't spill over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14637)|
| 4:04:01| Yes, it's LED lighting, and one of our requirements is that there is no light spillage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14641)|
| 4:04:05| In addition to that, the lighting will be interior to where the landscape buffer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14645)|
| 4:04:11| So, again, the goal is to have no light pollution, light, dark sky, none of those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14651)|
| 4:04:18| It's not like you're going to see it from five miles away lighting up the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| Right, we don't want to pay for it, and we obviously don't want to encroach that on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14661)|
| 4:04:25| neighbors. So it's really just what we need for a secure facility, and again, it's interior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14665)|
| 4:04:32| and we've submitted that plan to use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14672)|
| 4:04:34| So that'll be a part of our restrictions and requirements with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14674)|
| 4:04:38| Okay, thanks, and I guess back to Arthur or somebody from the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14678)|
| 4:04:43| The trucks, when you say there's 26 trucks a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14683)|
| 4:04:47| are they going back and forth from National Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| or half of them going out and going toward the interstate, or are they, what would be your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14689)|
| 4:04:56| David Weaver, Fresenius Medical, Ogden, Utah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| The truck traffic will be back and forth between the manufacturing facility and the warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14699)|
| 4:05:05| itself. They will carry full loads, often carrying an empty truck back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14705)|
| 4:05:10| so it will be continuous flow throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14710)|
| 4:05:13| Okay, so the majority of them will not be turning left into the facility, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14713)|
| 4:05:18| It'll be coming from National Drive in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14718)|
| 4:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14722)|
| 4:05:26| I didn't understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14726)|
| 4:05:28| I have to go back. I have to turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14728)|
| 4:05:30| Oh, no, I mean left coming from Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14730)|
| 4:05:38| We can't hear you all when you talk like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14738)|
| 4:05:39| If you want to say something, please come up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14739)|
| 4:05:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| They're going to be bringing product to the plant, to the distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14744)|
| 4:05:47| They're going to take the empty trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| They're going to have to turn left on John Sevier to go back to the plant to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14749)|
| 4:05:54| I was talking about coming from Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14754)|
| 4:05:56| What about the trucks that's going to have to take all of this stored product out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14756)|
| 4:06:03| When are those trucks coming in and out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| That's something they've not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| They're just addressing the trucks that's coming from National back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14767)|
| 4:06:12| I live on Hammer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14772)|
| 4:06:14| I'm at 6127 Hammer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14774)|
| 4:06:17| The building, I'm on Inman Branch Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14777)|
| 4:06:22| Where they're going to be building is 40 feet up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14782)|
| 4:06:24| Then the building is another 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14784)|
| 4:06:27| That's 85 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14787)|
| 4:06:28| How are they going to keep the light and noise off of my home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14788)|
| 4:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14792)|
| 4:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| As when I was growing up, I lived out there before the interstate was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14795)|
| 4:06:40| I remember when they built it back in, I guess, about 67s, you know, and I struggle with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14800)|
| 4:06:51| East Knoxville because it means so much to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14811)|
| 4:06:55| And I keep writing down the pros and the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| And I've driven John Sevier's truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14818)|
| 4:07:00| The pros and the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14820)|
| 4:07:02| And I've driven John Sevier all my life from Asheville Highway all the way up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14822)|
| 4:07:08| even as a kid when I worked there in Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14828)|
| 4:07:14| And the thing I keep coming back to, I look at my list, is jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14834)|
| 4:07:19| And that's the number one thing people always bring up to us are jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14839)|
| 4:07:23| And I think the restrictions we've made, and that was just for example, I'll go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14843)|
| 4:07:29| Midway, the way we're going to do the lighting, the way it's going to look, the sound requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14849)|
| 4:07:37| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14857)|
| 4:07:38| I think it's going, at Midway, it was going to be a lot better than people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14858)|
| 4:07:44| But the number one thing to me is there's going to be jobs five minutes away from some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14864)|
| 4:07:49| people driving an hour now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14869)|
| 4:07:53| Jobs seems to be driving this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14873)|
| 4:07:55| In the four years I've been on commission, zoning is the toughest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14875)|
| 4:08:03| Nobody here wants to make decisions on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| It's the toughest thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14885)|
| 4:08:08| Because you're trying to do what's best for the majority of people, and it's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14888)|
| 4:08:15| And I have to say, Dave has a very difficult situation there, but he does want jobs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14895)|
| 4:08:22| his area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14902)|
| 4:08:25| But I just want you all to know that this is not something we take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14905)|
| 4:08:30| And it has to be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14910)|
| 4:08:34| If this moves forward, we're not going to let something that's going to be loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14914)|
| 4:08:40| We're going to try to keep growth so that it doesn't encroach into people's lives as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14920)|
| 4:08:48| little as possible, but yet benefit the community by more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14928)|
| 4:08:52| That pays taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14932)|
| 4:08:54| That keeps our taxes low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14934)|
| 4:08:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14937)|
| 4:08:59| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14939)|
| 4:09:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14940)|
| 4:09:01| I have a question about the employee access road, if somebody could answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14941)|
| 4:09:09| What's the name of that road again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14949)|
| 4:09:10| Because I was traveling on Roscoe Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14950)|
| 4:09:13| So we're going to propose paving Roscoe Road, since that's in our century plan as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14953)|
| 4:09:21| But what other lighting or buffers provided, because I know there are two rental properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14961)|
| 4:09:29| along that road, but I know the entrance and exit of that Roscoe Road is very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14969)|
| 4:09:37| at times to pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14977)|
| 4:09:38| It's weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14978)|
| 4:09:39| It is weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14979)|
| 4:09:39| It's weird, because right now it kind of just tapers into almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14979)|
| 4:09:43| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14983)|
| 4:09:44| That's the reason I needed to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| No, part of our requirements with the county is to make a definitive end to where the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14986)|
| 4:09:52| road is and then where Fresenius, of course, begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14992)|
| 4:09:55| So that will be part of our site plan is to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| Obviously, we're a restricted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=14999)|
| 4:10:01| So if someone does get back in there and obviously isn't meant to be and needs to be able to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15001)|
| 4:10:05| around, we have to provide adequate means for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15005)|
| 4:10:07| So yes, that's part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| So my other statement is, does the flow of traffic with the speed, will that be impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15009)|
| 4:10:15| as people come around that curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15015)|
| 4:10:17| Is that a concern at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15017)|
| 4:10:20| The existing part of the traffic study was that we have a site distance minimum that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15020)|
| 4:10:26| we have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15026)|
| 4:10:27| And we're pretty close to meeting that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15027)|
| 4:10:30| The recommendation was for us to have the vegetation cleared along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15030)|
| 4:10:35| Obviously, the road's not been very well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15035)|
| 4:10:38| Neither has the vegetation in the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15038)|
| 4:10:41| So the traffic report dictated that we needed to coordinate that, make sure everything was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15041)|
| 4:10:46| in business mode, and then we'll have to meet our site distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15046)|
| 4:10:50| And this statement is for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15050)|
| 4:10:53| Before my last question, the MPC, is that we, I, because this district borders the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15053)|
| 4:11:02| that I serve in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15062)|
| 4:11:03| And I'm here and acknowledge your concerns and oppositions to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15063)|
| 4:11:09| So I'm just saying they have not fallen on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15069)|
| 4:11:13| And my question was for Mr. Green at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15073)|
| 4:11:17| If he could just comment on the, really, as we look at the zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15077)|
| 4:11:26| I'd like to hear what MPC's eight to six thoughts were on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15086)|
| 4:11:33| MPC's staff and the commission are sensitive to the need to preserve agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15093)|
| 4:11:40| The challenge is that zoning alone does not preserve agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15100)|
| 4:11:44| It takes a full range of actions from having people who are willing to farm the land to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15104)|
| 4:11:50| people who are willing to pay for the land to keep it in farm to making farming an economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15110)|
| 4:11:56| viable operation by people buying those products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15116)|
| 4:12:00| Maybe there's a range of programs to assist with those, most of which, some of which exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15120)|
| 4:12:06| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15126)|
| 4:12:07| Major ones do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| We look at the long-term needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15129)|
| 4:12:13| Looking at this property, we tried to look at 10, 20 years before, and I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15133)|
| 4:12:19| Thomas made a good point about the need for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15139)|
| 4:12:22| We're a growing county, urbanizing county, but the challenge to keep agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15142)|
| 4:12:27| viable in a growing, urbanizing county are almost insurmountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15147)|
| 4:12:33| But we do know that we need jobs to provide economic viability for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15153)|
| 4:12:38| We look at this location with its access to the interstate, with available utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15158)|
| 4:12:45| and the long-range projection for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| How do we preserve those areas more rural in East Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15167)|
| 4:12:51| Well, maybe one way to do that is to look at where growth and development can be concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15171)|
| 4:12:56| along our major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15176)|
| 4:12:59| All those thoughts were part of the process that made staff come to the conclusion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15179)|
| 4:13:06| recommend approval of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15186)|
| 4:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15188)|
| 4:13:11| I have a question for Fresenius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| I guess you're a logistics or transportation expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15193)|
| 4:13:20| And I think you've already given your name for the record, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15200)|
| 4:13:22| David Weaver, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15202)|
| 4:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15203)|
| 4:13:24| I've heard 2628 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15204)|
| 4:13:27| Now, is that trips from the manufacturing plant to the warehouse and back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15207)|
| 4:13:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15212)|
| 4:13:33| So the number that was given was an all-inclusive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| So that's including our product that's going out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15215)|
| 4:13:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15219)|
| 4:13:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15220)|
| 4:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15222)|
| 4:13:43| I just wanted you to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a comment which I find real interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15225)|
| 4:13:50| If they only have 28 trucks per day, why are they having, if I understood correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15230)|
| 4:13:56| something like 60 loading docks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15236)|
| 4:14:00| What will they be doing next year once they get that thing under roof, get it rolling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15240)|
| 4:14:05| They're not planning on putting 60 docks out there for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15245)|
| 4:14:08| They're not spending that money for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15248)|
| 4:14:11| I'm coming in to tell you they're going to have 28 trucks a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15251)|
| 4:14:14| That may be the first day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15254)|
| 4:14:16| How many will they have the next month or the next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15256)|
| 4:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15259)|
| 4:14:20| I'll get you that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15260)|
| 4:14:21| The things they're not telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| We have some conflict with the amount of product that they are manufacturing daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15263)|
| 4:14:36| and computing the amount of that product that fits per truck that they have recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15276)|
| 4:14:46| Our numbers are closer to 60 to 65 trucks would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15286)|
| 4:14:53| Do you have a comment on the volume that you told us you were going to manufacture at that tour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15293)|
| 4:15:02| Has that decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15302)|
| 4:15:06| Who did your calculations for transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15306)|
| 4:15:09| Was that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15309)|
| 4:15:09| Sir, by rules you're supposed to address us and then we'll ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15309)|
| 4:15:15| Would you all care to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15315)|
| 4:15:22| Commissioners, Mr. Chairman, the calculations we've made are based on our projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15322)|
| 4:15:31| maximum manufacturing production based on the plans that we have shown you as visitors to our plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15331)|
| 4:15:39| We have an aggressive program and we've been very clear and honest about what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15339)|
| 4:15:46| maximum potential output of those lines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15346)|
| 4:15:49| That's versus what they really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| If I tell you they make 12 million a year, that's maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15351)|
| 4:15:55| They might make nine depending on variables from the customer and etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15355)|
| 4:16:01| So when we described our current program based on our projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15361)|
| 4:16:08| the numbers are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15368)|
| 4:16:11| I'm sorry if they're confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| I understand how they could be, but those numbers are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15373)|
| 4:16:18| We show in our current projected planning somewhere total of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15378)|
| 4:16:26| We've said somewhere between 20 and 30 trucks a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15386)|
| 4:16:29| 28 seems to be the number that we're talking about and that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15389)|
| 4:16:33| That's a fair number for us to be discussing at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15393)|
| 4:16:37| Could you explain the bay doors on the loading dock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15397)|
| 4:16:43| There have been changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15403)|
| 4:16:44| Originally there were many more shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15404)|
| 4:16:47| I think that would be up to the architect to describe exactly what the new number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15407)|
| 4:16:54| It was from the rendering versus the actual design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15414)|
| 4:16:58| Could you also explain a little bit about the nature of your product and how it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15418)|
| 4:17:03| to be staged in different areas that would require access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15423)|
| 4:17:07| That's exactly where I was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15427)|
| 4:17:08| So the nature of our product requires a lot of eyeballs to look at this for accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15428)|
| 4:17:14| So obviously we have the first audit that takes place by a picker is the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15434)|
| 4:17:18| It's the person that's going to select a product from the racking and then stage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15438)|
| 4:17:22| We have a second auditor that comes in and then we also have a pharmacist that is licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15442)|
| 4:17:27| to where this product is being distributed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15447)|
| 4:17:29| So it receives three audits and it's staged at a specific door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15449)|
| 4:17:33| That's why we have so many doors because you will stage a certain load for this door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15453)|
| 4:17:36| and we do it two to three days in advance based on volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15456)|
| 4:17:40| So that's the reason for so many doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15460)|
| 4:17:42| And also we will be implementing a recycling program for cardboard, pallets, plastic, plastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15462)|
| 4:17:49| wrap, some of our other products as well, which automatically consumes five to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15469)|
| 4:17:53| doors right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15473)|
| 4:17:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15476)|
| 4:17:57| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15477)|
| 4:18:03| I think this is, sorry, I think this company is a godsend for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15483)|
| 4:18:09| This is hundreds and hundreds of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| Your grandchildren are going to have jobs for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| They can make $70,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| It may not be a big deal to you, but I know it is for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15495)|
| 4:18:19| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15499)|
| 4:18:20| The people in East Knox County, I remember this during the problems with the other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15500)|
| 4:18:27| in this part of the country, but in West Knoxville, in West Knox County, when they built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15507)|
| 4:18:33| the FedEx terminals out there, I didn't hear one complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15513)|
| 4:18:37| Not one complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| But for some reason, this part of the country, you don't want anything to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15519)|
| 4:18:43| You don't want anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15523)|
| 4:18:44| I was speaking at a Republican club up in Asheville Highway in Straw Plains one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15524)|
| 4:18:52| and I said, you know, this highway has the same businesses on it that it had on it 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15532)|
| 4:18:57| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15537)|
| 4:18:58| And he said, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15538)|
| 4:18:59| And that's the way we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| Well, I don't think, I don't think that's the future, but I do understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15543)|
| 4:19:07| But it's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15547)|
| 4:19:10| Commissioner Neistat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15550)|
| 4:19:14| I'd like to make a motion that we approve item number 59, which is that we approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15554)|
| 4:19:21| PC commercial zoning consistent with the sector plan that we recently approved per MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15561)|
| 4:19:27| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15569)|
| 4:19:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15571)|
| 4:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15571)|

| 4:21:19| Madam Clerk, will you please read the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15679)|
| 4:21:22| This is item 63-A-18-SP, request of Randy Grenard for a North City Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15682)|
| 4:21:30| from AG Agricultural SLP Slope Protection Area and STPA Stream Protection Area to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15690)|
| 4:21:38| Low Density Residential SLPA Slope Protection Area and STPA Stream Protection Area, property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15698)|
| 4:21:47| located northeast side of Beverly Road, south of Oakland Drive, Commission District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15707)|
| 4:21:53| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15713)|
| 4:21:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15715)|
| 4:21:56| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15716)|
| 4:22:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15720)|
| 4:22:04| Can we get the report from the MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15724)|
| 4:22:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15727)|
| 4:22:08| Mr. Chair, members of the commission, the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15728)|
| 4:22:11| Oh, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15731)|
| 4:22:12| Just a minute, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15732)|
| 4:22:13| I wanted to recognize City Councilman Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15733)|
| 4:22:17| She's also out here today that we forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15737)|
| 4:22:24| Mr. Chair, members of the commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 9-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15744)|
| 4:22:28| to recommend that the County Commission adopt Resolution 3-A-18-SP amending the North City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15748)|
| 4:22:35| Sector Plan to LDR and STPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15755)|
| 4:22:41| The Planning Commission felt that the change in the land use designation would allow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15761)|
| 4:22:48| rezoning at a density which would provide the opportunity for a creative development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15768)|
| 4:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15774)|
| 4:22:56| Would the applicant wish to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15776)|
| 4:22:59| And you did hear the guidelines were running by tonight, 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15779)|
| 4:23:10| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S-700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15790)|
| 4:23:20| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Randy Gennard, in request of the Sector Plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15800)|
| 4:23:28| Currently, the Sector Plan for this property is for agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15808)|
| 4:23:33| We have requested an LDR, sector amendment to LDR, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15813)|
| 4:23:40| We believe that there is, in one of the factors to be proven for a Sector Plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15820)|
| 4:23:47| that there is, in fact, an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15827)|
| 4:23:53| In support of this, the property has been for sale for over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15833)|
| 4:23:58| However, the property has not sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15838)|
| 4:24:00| The current owners inherited the property in 2007, and Mr. Gennard's offer to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15840)|
| 4:24:07| and contract is the first offer that has been recognized on this track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15847)|
| 4:24:14| The current Sector Plan makes the property impractical for development for its best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15854)|
| 4:24:21| With the current Sector Plan of agricultural, it is essentially forcing a high-density development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15861)|
| 4:24:29| when you factor in the zoning of RB, which is general residential in part, and then industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15869)|
| 4:24:35| in part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15875)|
| 4:24:37| There's a Sector Plan of low-density residential surrounding this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15877)|
| 4:24:41| To the north, to the west, to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15881)|
| 4:24:45| The infrastructure and the basis to support that there is an error or omission in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15885)|
| 4:24:49| plan is when you look at the surrounding properties and the infrastructure costs to develop this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15889)|
| 4:24:54| property, it's essentially impossible based on the current Sector Plan and the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15894)|
| 4:25:00| for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15900)|
| 4:25:03| The instant facts in this case are like the case that I cited in my letter to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15903)|
| 4:25:08| in Reddick v. Smith, which is a long-standing Tennessee Supreme Court case, where the Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15908)|
| 4:25:14| Court held that the Municipal Board correctly amended the ordinances to allow for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15914)|
| 4:25:21| development on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15921)|
| 4:25:23| In that case, similar to here, there was real estate that had been for sale for over seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15923)|
| 4:25:29| years and had not sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15929)|
| 4:25:31| The prior use on the property was as a nursery, and that use had long since been terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15931)|
| 4:25:37| and that use had long been gone, and there were no leases or any other interest in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15937)|
| 4:25:43| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15943)|
| 4:25:44| When you factored in the surrounding area, there was development consistent with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15944)|
| 4:25:50| was requested for the amendments to the plans and ordinances at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15950)|
| 4:25:55| This is essentially the same facts that we have here, where the Tennessee Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15955)|
| 4:26:00| held that the Zoning Board or Municipal Board acted correctly in granting the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15960)|
| 4:26:07| and the rezonings to allow the property to be adequately used and properly used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15967)|
| 4:26:14| This is not an agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15974)|
| 4:26:16| This property has not been used for agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15976)|
| 4:26:19| This property has sat vacant and dormant for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15979)|
| 4:26:23| I mean, we're closing in on over two decades now, and before that it had a few cows on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15983)|
| 4:26:29| it, but ever since then, this property has been unusable and undesirable based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15989)|
| 4:26:36| sector plan and the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15996)|
| 4:26:39| The current use for the property under the industrial zone and the general residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=15999)|
| 4:26:44| zone allow for heavy, intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16004)|
| 4:26:48| The industrial zone, as we heard earlier, when comparing it to light industrial, heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16008)|
| 4:26:55| industrial is the most, as our code zoning ordinance cites, it is the most heavily intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16015)|
| 4:27:01| use for a property that is known to have adverse impacts on the surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16021)|
| 4:27:07| That's what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16027)|
| 4:27:09| That is your manufacturing facilities that manufacture, for instance, our ordinance allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16029)|
| 4:27:16| as a use permitted, manufacturing rubber and plastic, such as tire and plastic products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16036)|
| 4:27:22| manufacturing wood products, such as a lumber mill, a sawmill, or even paper products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16042)|
| 4:27:28| Even under this industrial zone, this could be a waste management site, whether it be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16048)|
| 4:27:34| landfill or some solid liquid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16054)|
| 4:27:37| It could be a fulfillment center, such as a call center or online shopping, a fulfillment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16057)|
| 4:27:46| home shopping network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16066)|
| 4:27:47| It could be a distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16067)|
| 4:27:50| It could be a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16070)|
| 4:27:52| Under any heavy, intense use is what this property is zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16072)|
| 4:27:58| Also, the property is zoned for general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16078)|
| 4:28:01| It is on the upper part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16081)|
| 4:28:03| Under general residential, it is a much higher density that you could have in a general residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16083)|
| 4:28:08| zone, such as apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16088)|
| 4:28:11| We could, under the current zone, it is permitted, per the zoning ordinance, up to 12 units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16091)|
| 4:28:17| acre, 12 units per acre of apartments in this RB zone, within the confines of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16097)|
| 4:28:25| zone, you are looking at 220 apartment units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16105)|
| 4:28:32| When looking at what could go here right now versus what we are asking for, the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16112)|
| 4:28:43| is certainly a lot more conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16123)|
| 4:28:46| With a low density residential sector plan amendment, that is going to invite the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16126)|
| 4:28:53| to a plan residential, which is then going to necessitate a use on review, where everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16133)|
| 4:28:59| about this property for this development is going to have to go through the intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16139)|
| 4:29:04| use on review process, where everything is considered, all the ordinances for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16144)|
| 4:29:11| proper development, are examined and adhered to, and then it comes back through for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16151)|
| 4:29:21| There is a need currently for housing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16161)|
| 4:29:24| I could not tell you how many NPC meetings, county commission and city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16164)|
| 4:29:29| that I have been to, that the discussion has come up from real estate professionals indicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16169)|
| 4:29:35| that there is essentially an inventory crisis here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16175)|
| 4:29:39| I have confirmed with Jennifer Roach with the Knoxville Area Realty Association, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16179)|
| 4:29:46| she cited the statistics of the housing inventory crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16186)|

| 4:29:58| less than what it was last year at this time, and last year there was a cited housing inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16198)|

| 4:30:21| the most underserved market in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16221)|
| 4:30:27| The density request, which is more of an argument under the rezoning, is a proper density request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16227)|

| 4:30:38| When you factor in the acreage here and you consider comparable developments in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16238)|
| 4:30:43| right now, a 3.1 per acre density is very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16243)|
| 4:30:50| Density has to be at a certain level or development cannot happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16250)|
| 4:30:55| Simply the infrastructure costs become unaffordable and the practicality of the development cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16255)|
| 4:31:02| go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16262)|
| 4:31:03| At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce evidence into the record and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16263)|
| 4:31:08| testimony from a witness, Mr. Benny Moorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16268)|
| 4:31:14| If I could ask him some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16274)|
| 4:31:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16276)|
| 4:31:16| If you would, sir, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16276)|
| 4:31:21| Benny Moorman, Benchmark Associates, PO Box 23892, Knoxville 37933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16281)|
| 4:31:27| Mr. Moorman, what is your profession?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16287)|
| 4:31:29| I am a registered land surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16289)|
| 4:31:32| What certifications do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16292)|
| 4:31:34| I am one of the few surveyors in the area that actually hold a degree in land surveying and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16294)|
| 4:31:39| have a license from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16299)|
| 4:31:43| Do you have any other qualifications or certificates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16303)|
| 4:31:47| I am also one of 28 certified floodplain surveyors in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16307)|
| 4:31:52| Mr. Moorman, as part of your profession, are you involved in development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16312)|
| 4:31:56| Yes, I have been involved at my current company for the past 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16316)|
| 4:32:01| Development here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16321)|
| 4:32:03| Mostly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16323)|
| 4:32:05| And as part of your profession and your training and your knowledge, do you have knowledge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16325)|
| 4:32:13| costs associated with development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16333)|
| 4:32:15| Yes, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16335)|
| 4:32:17| And when it comes to development, what is the most expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16337)|
| 4:32:21| component of the financing of the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16341)|
| 4:32:24| The infrastructure for the development, being the roadways, the utilities, the storm drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16344)|
| 4:32:33| And on a development like this, there has been a concept plan, a preliminary concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16353)|
| 4:32:37| shown, what is it about this site that would make the infrastructure cost what they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16357)|
| 4:32:46| The most developable part of the property is back into the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16366)|
| 4:32:50| so you are basically going to be served, as the exhibit that you have seen shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16370)|
| 4:32:55| a 1,400 foot street that would yield, could, through development practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16375)|
| 4:33:02| yield lots on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16382)|
| 4:33:03| That is about 1,400 feet with the cost that developers are using today and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16383)|
| 4:33:10| infrastructure costs are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16390)|
| 4:33:11| You are looking at $600 to $650 per linear foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16391)|
| 4:33:15| so you are looking at somewhere around $750 to $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16395)|
| 4:33:20| That being said, if you tried to go with the current sector plan and do an agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16400)|
| 4:33:29| development, and we will say be conservative, number one, because of the limited depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16409)|
| 4:33:34| you are going to have wide lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16414)|
| 4:33:36| A limited depth of property before you get into the steep hillside, you are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16416)|
| 4:33:40| have wide lots and therefore you are only going to yield somewhere around 7 to 10 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16420)|
| 4:33:46| over 1,400 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16426)|
| 4:33:48| And that kind of infrastructure cost just cannot support that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16428)|
| 4:33:54| And how do developers justify doing a development or afford to do certain developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16434)|
| 4:34:03| Based on their yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16443)|
| 4:34:04| They have to give a certain amount of yield to substantiate the infrastructure cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16444)|
| 4:34:08| And is that the yield referred to as density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16448)|
| 4:34:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16451)|
| 4:34:12| In your opinion, what is the highest and best use of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16452)|
| 4:34:16| I think for all involved, low density residential is the best use for the community and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16456)|
| 4:34:21| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16461)|
| 4:34:23| Can this property be feasibly developed under the current sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16463)|
| 4:34:29| Not in my eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16469)|
| 4:34:30| I mean, the only way it would be developed as it is, is by the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16470)|
| 4:34:37| If it does remain at agricultural, the property is going to remain dormant or it is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16477)|
| 4:34:43| to be approached by a developer that would go for a high density or an industrial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16483)|
| 4:34:49| Let me ask that question better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16489)|
| 4:34:52| Can this property be feasibly developed under the current sector plan for single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16492)|
| 4:34:58| residential units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16498)|
| 4:34:59| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16499)|
| 4:35:00| I mean, there is no way with the amount of infrastructure that this could be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16500)|
| 4:35:05| single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16505)|
| 4:35:07| Thank you, Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16507)|
| 4:35:09| So, again, to try to close up here, this sector plan amendment to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16509)|
| 4:35:17| results ultimately in a conservative development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16517)|
| 4:35:21| Now, I understand with progress comes change and change, a lot of people don't like change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16521)|
| 4:35:30| I don't like change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16530)|
| 4:35:31| I like my routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16531)|
| 4:35:33| When a property such as this size has been dormant and been undeveloped, it's frightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16533)|
| 4:35:40| when somebody comes along to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16540)|
| 4:35:43| But I can tell you, Knox County property is not in surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16543)|
| 4:35:50| You know, real estate, as they all say, they ain't making any more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16550)|
| 4:35:54| So, what you have right now are multi-family developments, apartment complexes, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16554)|
| 4:36:00| high in demand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16560)|
| 4:36:02| The market shows it, you know, whether that market can sustain it or not, apartments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16562)|
| 4:36:08| being built nonstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16568)|
| 4:36:09| They've been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16569)|
| 4:36:10| They've been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16570)|
| 4:36:12| Permits are still being pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16572)|
| 4:36:13| Where apartments have been developed in this county are on the most viable, cost efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16573)|
| 4:36:22| properties, meaning the infrastructure costs are the most cost friendly because these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16582)|
| 4:36:30| the preferred properties, the easiest ones to develop, the ones that don't require as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16590)|
| 4:36:35| much draining, don't require as much stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16595)|
| 4:36:37| Those properties are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16597)|
| 4:36:38| Those properties that are under contract or have been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16598)|
| 4:36:41| So, what comes next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16601)|
| 4:36:43| The multi-family market is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16603)|
| 4:36:45| Apartments are still here, so they're going to go on to the more challenging sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16605)|
| 4:36:48| And as this property is currently zoned, it could be one of those next sites to be apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16608)|
| 4:36:55| So, when you look at density, you know, a lot of times you've got to compromise on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16615)|
| 4:37:03| what's better for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16623)|
| 4:37:06| A conservative development where somebody is wanting to go through the use-on-reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16626)|
| 4:37:10| process or development that will allow for apartments, buy right, or allow for heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16630)|
| 4:37:17| impactful industrial use, manufacturing, distribution, waste management, landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16637)|
| 4:37:27| The option to me is you take the most conservative approach that has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16647)|
| 4:37:32| use-on-review process that can be analyzed by the proper people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16652)|
| 4:37:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16655)|
| 4:37:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16658)|

| 4:38:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16703)|
| 4:38:29| I am 15 years old and a rising freshman at Central High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16709)|
| 4:38:33| It has long been my dream to build on my Papaw's land and be the fifth generation to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16713)|
| 4:38:38| This rezoning will essentially end my dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16718)|
| 4:38:43| The development would cause additional flooding all over Fountain City and all the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16723)|
| 4:38:47| Broadway because White's Creek flows into First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16727)|
| 4:38:52| In May, Commissioner Carringer held a community meeting the neighbors and developer attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16732)|
| 4:38:59| At that meeting, 75 people signed cards opposing the rezoning on Beverly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16739)|
| 4:39:10| I gave you a list of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16750)|
| 4:39:13| One of the ladies at that meeting told how my Papaw rescued her son from drowning on our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16753)|
| 4:39:19| My Papaw grabbed him from the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16759)|
| 4:39:21| Due to the extreme flooding we already have, a child almost died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16761)|
| 4:39:29| This happened only 40 feet from the proposed development's entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16769)|
| 4:39:34| You also have a handout of the FEMA flood map showing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16774)|
| 4:39:39| Do you see Beverly Road in orange?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16779)|
| 4:39:43| And the property outlined in red?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16783)|
| 4:39:57| Do you all see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16797)|
| 4:40:05| My last handout was a map and descriptions of the soil types on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16805)|
| 4:40:09| This information came from the soil survey of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16809)|
| 4:40:12| and it is complicated, but it's easy to see that on three of the soil types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16812)|
| 4:40:17| development is poorly suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16817)|
| 4:40:20| With the fourth soil type, development is only moderately suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16820)|
| 4:40:27| You can clearly see that with all these soil types, the main hazard is the risk of erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16827)|
| 4:40:34| County Commissioners, you have the power to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16834)|

| 4:41:21| most of those acreage with a slope of 20 to 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16881)|
| 4:41:26| That's almost 60 acres right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16886)|
| 4:41:29| We can talk about traffic increasing by 1,500 trips a day on a substandard road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16889)|
| 4:41:37| with horizontal and vertical curves, a railroad crossing with no arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16897)|
| 4:41:43| a one-lane bridge, and many other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16903)|
| 4:41:47| And every single one of these issues is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16907)|
| 4:41:52| But you know, NPC staff said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16912)|
| 4:41:58| Quote, our recommendation of one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16918)|
| 4:42:03| gives him reasonable use of his land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16923)|
| 4:42:07| consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16927)|
| 4:42:13| That's all County Commission is required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16933)|
| 4:42:17| give him reasonable use of his land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16937)|
| 4:42:20| not the highest and best, but reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16940)|
| 4:42:24| Commissioners, you all received a letter from the developer and from his attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16944)|
| 4:42:33| Please do not be deceived by Mr. Forrester's letter when he says, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16953)|
| 4:42:41| approval of these requests simply allows him to submit a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16961)|
| 4:42:47| and a development plan to NPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16967)|
| 4:42:51| That's not true. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16971)|
| 4:42:57| The fact is, first of all, approval and allowing a greater density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16977)|
| 4:43:03| takes all future decision of the entire development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16983)|
| 4:43:08| out of the hands of County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16988)|
| 4:43:11| He said it came back here. It doesn't come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16991)|
| 4:43:15| And Mr. Schoonmaker and Mr. Daly were on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16995)|
| 4:43:19| and they know that's where uses-on-review and plan development goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=16999)|
| 4:43:23| It doesn't come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17003)|
| 4:43:27| Secondly, he trivializes the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17007)|
| 4:43:32| The sector plan is an adopted plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17012)|
| 4:43:36| It's a guide for NPC staff's monthly decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17016)|
| 4:43:41| And your decision tonight on density is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17021)|
| 4:43:47| NPC staff, commissioners, and everyone has agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17027)|
| 4:43:53| even Mr. Gennard, he wants planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17033)|
| 4:43:57| Nobody's against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17037)|
| 4:43:59| I don't know where this confusion keeps coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17039)|
| 4:44:03| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17043)|
| 4:44:05| The question is not about use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17045)|
| 4:44:08| The question is about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17048)|
| 4:44:11| Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17051)|
| 4:44:14| Leaving the sector plan designation as agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17054)|
| 4:44:18| tells the developer that he must design a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17058)|
| 4:44:23| and a use-on-review at one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17063)|
| 4:44:27| If you amend the sector plan to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17067)|
| 4:44:32| and set the planned residential density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17072)|
| 4:44:35| at two or three or more dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17075)|
| 4:44:39| it enables the developer to submit a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17079)|
| 4:44:43| and a use-on-review well above the professional staff's recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17083)|
| 4:44:51| And as important as all that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17091)|
| 4:44:55| I think the most important thing we have to consider is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17095)|
| 4:44:59| that no significant changes in conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17099)|
| 4:45:03| that would be a legal basis to allow a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17103)|
| 4:45:07| have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17107)|
| 4:45:09| And I'd like for us to look at each one of those one at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17109)|
| 4:45:13| with the comments that NPC staff made about each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17113)|
| 4:45:20| We're going to look at these one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17120)|
| 4:45:40| These are the things that allow a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17140)|
| 4:45:44| Number one, introduction of new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17144)|
| 4:45:47| NPC staff says in their report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17147)|
| 4:45:51| no known improvements have been made to Beverly Road in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17151)|
| 4:45:56| No infrastructure improvements have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17156)|
| 4:46:00| that warrant any change to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17160)|
| 4:46:06| Number two, error or omission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17166)|
| 4:46:09| which Mr. Forrester likes to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17169)|
| 4:46:12| NPC staff said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17172)|
| 4:46:15| current sector plan proposes agricultural uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17175)|
| 4:46:21| This limits residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17181)|
| 4:46:23| to no more than one dwelling unit per acre density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17183)|
| 4:46:28| And the steep slopes and floodway limitations of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17188)|
| 4:46:33| make it unsuitable for development at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17193)|
| 4:46:37| exceeding one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17197)|
| 4:46:40| Therefore, a sector plan amendment is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17200)|
| 4:46:47| Unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17207)|
| 4:46:48| Those are NPC's words, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17208)|
| 4:46:50| NPC and their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17210)|
| 4:46:53| Number two, three, changes in government policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17213)|
| 4:46:58| There have been no changes in government policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17218)|
| 4:47:02| NPC staff says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17222)|
| 4:47:04| quote, the current plan designation of agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17224)|
| 4:47:09| will allow the applicant reasonable use of his land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17229)|
| 4:47:13| which is considerably steep and has limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17233)|
| 4:47:18| because of the adjacent floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17238)|
| 4:47:21| Unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17241)|
| 4:47:23| Number four, trends in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17243)|
| 4:47:27| NPC staff again says, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17247)|
| 4:47:30| low density uses have long been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17250)|
| 4:47:33| The property is suitable for limited residential density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17253)|
| 4:47:38| allowable under the current sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17258)|
| 4:47:43| The bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17263)|
| 4:47:45| NPC staff's recommended zoning and density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17265)|
| 4:47:49| are consistent with the current sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17269)|
| 4:47:55| There is no legal basis for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17275)|
| 4:48:00| If you vote for the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17280)|
| 4:48:03| you must clearly state which one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17283)|
| 4:48:07| which one of these four is the basis for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17287)|
| 4:48:13| And it has to be in the record and you have to state why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17293)|
| 4:48:20| And NPC has explained why each one of these does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17300)|
| 4:48:25| Does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17305)|
| 4:48:27| We are asking you to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17307)|
| 4:48:30| NPC professional staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17310)|
| 4:48:34| to deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17314)|
| 4:48:37| and approve planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17317)|
| 4:48:39| at a density of up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17319)|
| 4:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17324)|
| 4:48:47| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17327)|
| 4:48:56| And 47 seconds left on the clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17336)|
| 4:48:58| plus three minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17338)|
| 4:49:08| To respond to Ms. Rowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17348)|
| 4:49:11| as to the five requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17351)|
| 4:49:16| for an amendment to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17356)|
| 4:49:19| an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17359)|
| 4:49:22| I believe Ms. Rowe was quoting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17362)|
| 4:49:24| but failed to mention in the NPC staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17364)|
| 4:49:28| the current sector plan proposes agricultural uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17368)|
| 4:49:32| with slope and stream protection for the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17372)|
| 4:49:35| which is not consistent with the property's current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17375)|
| 4:49:39| industrial or general residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17379)|
| 4:49:44| Not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17384)|
| 4:49:46| So the question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17386)|
| 4:49:47| is does the sector plan process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17387)|
| 4:49:52| take into account the current zoning on properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17392)|
| 4:49:55| And if so, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17395)|
| 4:49:59| Do you want me to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17399)|
| 4:50:02| I can't ask him questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17402)|
| 4:50:04| I'll answer for NPC to stop the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17404)|
| 4:50:08| The sector plan does not necessarily look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17408)|
| 4:50:11| always at the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17411)|
| 4:50:12| What the sector plan does is identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17412)|
| 4:50:16| what we feel is the best potential future use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17416)|
| 4:50:19| for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17419)|
| 4:50:20| And I will apologize for NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17420)|
| 4:50:24| We have no mechanism now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17424)|
| 4:50:26| other than the rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17426)|
| 4:50:28| at which time staff makes a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17428)|
| 4:50:30| to try to bring the zoning into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17430)|
| 4:50:33| with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17433)|
| 4:50:34| So to answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17434)|
| 4:50:36| no, the sector plans do not always look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17436)|
| 4:50:40| at the current zoning as a guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17440)|
| 4:50:41| to the future use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17441)|
| 4:50:45| And again, to reiterate my support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17445)|
| 4:50:48| for the obvious error or omission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17448)|
| 4:50:51| and I cite back to the Reddick versus Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17451)|
| 4:50:55| Tennessee Supreme Court case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17455)|
| 4:50:57| which is factually on point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17457)|
| 4:51:00| and still good law in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17460)|
| 4:51:02| from our highest court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17462)|
| 4:51:04| Now there's been mention of flooding and traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17464)|
| 4:51:09| in this request for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17469)|
| 4:51:13| And I would ask that maybe a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17473)|
| 4:51:15| be proposed to Mr. Armstrong or Mr. Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17475)|
| 4:51:19| as to what is the proper consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17479)|
| 4:51:22| for a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17482)|
| 4:51:25| and whether flooding and traffic is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17485)|
| 4:51:32| Dr. Clark, do you have an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17492)|
| 4:51:34| To be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17494)|
| 4:51:37| Well, the commission can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17497)|
| 4:51:40| those types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17500)|
| 4:51:42| based on proper testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17502)|
| 4:51:46| And whether proper testimony is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17506)|
| 4:51:48| Whether proper testimony is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17508)|
| 4:51:50| In order to have proper testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17510)|
| 4:51:51| on either of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17511)|
| 4:51:55| it's best to have expert testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17515)|
| 4:51:58| And an expert, a traffic engineer might speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17518)|
| 4:52:03| and say that there's some traffic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17523)|
| 4:52:05| or a water quality engineer might speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17525)|
| 4:52:11| and say that there are some flooding concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17531)|
| 4:52:16| But still, those issues are better addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17536)|
| 4:52:20| at the concept plan stage or the final plan stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17540)|
| 4:52:24| where all of the calculations can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17544)|
| 4:52:30| This is more focused on whether there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17550)|
| 4:52:33| an appropriate use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17553)|
| 4:52:36| And that's what the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17556)|
| 4:52:37| in the sector plan is focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17557)|
| 4:52:39| So with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17559)|
| 4:52:42| you're determining whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17562)|
| 4:52:44| any of those conditions are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| With the rezoning, you're focused on the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17566)|
| 4:52:50| in the zoning ordinance and meeting those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17570)|
| 4:52:52| So they factor in tangentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17572)|
| 4:52:57| but those unfounded fears and speculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17577)|
| 4:53:03| about what might be without expert testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17583)|
| 4:53:05| aren't proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17585)|
| 4:53:07| And so which would be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17587)|
| 4:53:10| for the use on review should the applicant...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17590)|
| 4:53:21| Which would be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17601)|
| 4:53:23| should the applicant gain a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17603)|
| 4:53:26| and rezoning request, which would then be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17606)|
| 4:53:29| for consideration of the appropriate experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17609)|
| 4:53:33| at the time on the use on review consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17613)|
| 4:53:37| Ms. Rowe misrepresents my statement that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17617)|
| 4:53:45| Or misquotes me on saying that the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17625)|
| 4:53:47| comes back here and she misquotes herself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17627)|
| 4:53:49| on saying that it goes to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17629)|
| 4:53:51| It goes to the MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17631)|
| 4:53:53| which then goes to the MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17633)|
| 4:53:56| The ultimate consideration here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17636)|
| 4:54:01| we've got a property that's been dormant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17641)|
| 4:54:04| for 20 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17644)|
| 4:54:07| There has been one contract to purchase the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17647)|
| 4:54:12| and that is a recent contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17652)|
| 4:54:14| So how can the sector plan not need to be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17654)|
| 4:54:19| when you consider all of those facts and circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17659)|
| 4:54:22| which mirror and track exactly to the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17662)|
| 4:54:25| of the case of Reddick versus Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17665)|
| 4:54:28| wherein the Tennessee Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17668)|
| 4:54:30| stated that the Municipal Board acted correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17670)|
| 4:54:33| in amending the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17673)|
| 4:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17675)|
| 4:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17675)|
| 4:54:38| The opposition has four minutes and 47 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17678)|
| 4:54:41| left on their timer and three minutes of rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17681)|
| 4:54:44| So seven minutes, 47 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17684)|
| 4:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17686)|
| 4:54:51| Don't exactly know where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17691)|
| 4:54:54| First of all, Mr. Brousseau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17694)|
| 4:54:56| in the minutes of comments from the March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17696)|
| 4:55:00| MPC meeting, said the north sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17700)|
| 4:55:04| shows this property as agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17704)|
| 4:55:07| because of how rough it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17707)|
| 4:55:10| I'll go to the case he keeps citing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17710)|
| 4:55:12| In Reddick versus Smith, Mr. Forrester says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17712)|
| 4:55:15| zoning requirements resulted in the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17715)|
| 4:55:17| not being able to do anything with his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17717)|
| 4:55:21| You know, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17721)|
| 4:55:24| MPC clearly stated under the current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17724)|
| 4:55:28| that he has reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17728)|
| 4:55:30| That's all that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17730)|
| 4:55:32| Also, in the cited case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17732)|
| 4:55:34| the two parties were in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17734)|
| 4:55:37| about what the zoning should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17737)|
| 4:55:39| commercial versus residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17739)|
| 4:55:42| Also, that case did not go before a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17742)|
| 4:55:46| It went before a quasi-judicial board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17746)|
| 4:55:49| which was a board of zoning appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17749)|
| 4:55:52| and they were appointed people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17752)|
| 4:55:53| It wasn't a legislative body, as you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17753)|
| 4:55:58| So, in this case, everyone's in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17758)|
| 4:56:02| that planned residential is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17762)|
| 4:56:04| Again, the question is not use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17764)|
| 4:56:07| It is density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17767)|
| 4:56:09| Density is what we're concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17769)|
| 4:56:11| for the flooding and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17771)|
| 4:56:14| He goes back to that we talked about flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| Sure, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17776)|
| 4:56:18| But these four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17778)|
| 4:56:21| one of those has to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17781)|
| 4:56:23| and MPC took each one and explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17783)|
| 4:56:26| how none of them applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17786)|
| 4:56:28| to have a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17788)|
| 4:56:30| I've explained that to you with staff's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17790)|
| 4:56:35| not my comments, but theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17795)|
| 4:56:38| that it doesn't warrant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17798)|
| 4:56:40| And I beg to differ with his idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17800)|
| 4:56:45| When he presents a development plan to use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17805)|
| 4:56:48| it goes to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17808)|
| 4:56:49| Sure, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17809)|
| 4:56:50| And then it goes to the board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17810)|
| 4:56:52| It does not come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17812)|
| 4:56:54| He said it came back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17814)|
| 4:56:57| We need to be very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17817)|
| 4:57:02| on what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17822)|
| 4:57:04| We're talking about a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17824)|
| 4:57:08| Those four reasons are the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17828)|
| 4:57:09| There's not five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17829)|
| 4:57:10| I don't know where he gets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17830)|
| 4:57:12| There's only four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17832)|
| 4:57:15| One of those has to be what you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17835)|
| 4:57:20| And MPC took each one of them apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17840)|
| 4:57:23| and said why that was not a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17843)|
| 4:57:26| that no sector plan amendment is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17846)|
| 4:57:31| Also, within the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17851)|
| 4:57:34| it talks about the land remaining agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17854)|
| 4:57:40| The density is the big issue before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17860)|
| 4:57:43| and that's the critical decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17863)|
| 4:57:45| that needs to be made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17865)|
| 4:57:55| Before we get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17875)|
| 4:57:56| I'd like to ask a couple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17876)|
| 4:57:58| to make sure we have some clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17878)|
| 4:57:59| on some of the major issues I believe we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17879)|
| 4:58:03| Cindy, could you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17883)|
| 4:58:14| And Gerald, you're welcome to chime in on these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17894)|
| 4:58:17| I think they're both things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17897)|
| 4:58:19| that your staff and Cindy's staff would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17899)|
| 4:58:23| I'll start with the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17903)|
| 4:58:25| To our current engineering design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17905)|
| 4:58:28| would they allow for water control on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17908)|
| 4:58:31| to be reduced to even less than it is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17911)|
| 4:58:34| if properly done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17914)|
| 4:58:35| Are there enough restrictions in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17915)|
| 4:58:40| They cannot make the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17920)|
| 4:58:42| any worse than they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17922)|
| 4:58:45| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17925)|
| 4:58:47| We haven't obviously seen any kind of design plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17927)|
| 4:58:49| so I have no idea if they can make it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17929)|
| 4:58:51| but they are only required not to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17931)|
| 4:58:54| any worse than it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17934)|
| 4:58:56| And can that be achieved with the standards we have today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17936)|
| 4:59:00| That I'm not sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17940)|
| 4:59:02| I would have to defer to somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17942)|
| 4:59:03| in the stormwater department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17943)|
| 4:59:06| Gerald, can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17946)|
| 4:59:08| We look to the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17948)|
| 4:59:11| county engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17951)|
| 4:59:12| to provide guidance on stormwater measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17952)|
| 4:59:16| and their staff, stormwater staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17956)|
| 4:59:17| the Leo Camare, who...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17957)|
| 4:59:20| So we don't have anybody here from engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17960)|
| 4:59:23| that can answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17963)|
| 4:59:25| Not at this time, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17965)|
| 4:59:33| In broad terms, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17973)|
| 4:59:35| the ordinance will permit the volume of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17975)|
| 4:59:38| from the site to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17978)|
| 4:59:39| It will not permit the velocity of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17979)|
| 4:59:42| from the site to increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17982)|
| 4:59:43| certainly not to the point of what's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17983)|
| 4:59:45| erosive velocity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17985)|
| 4:59:47| But given that you are going to add impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17987)|
| 4:59:50| they will be required to detain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17990)|
| 4:59:52| their additional water and then discharge it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17992)|
| 4:59:55| in a manner that doesn't contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17995)|
| 4:59:58| to any further downstream flooding problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=17998)|
| 5:00:01| that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18001)|
| 5:00:03| As Cindy's right, somebody from stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18003)|
| 5:00:04| could probably speak to that in more specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18004)|
| 5:00:07| and detail than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18007)|
| 5:00:08| but I can tell you that the ordinance does contemplate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18008)|
| 5:00:11| that with additional impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18011)|
| 5:00:13| additional water will leave the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18013)|
| 5:00:15| but it has to be metered in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18015)|
| 5:00:17| that it doesn't have an increase in velocity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18017)|
| 5:00:20| and contribute to erosive force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18020)|
| 5:00:22| downstream sedimentation, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18022)|
| 5:00:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18024)|
| 5:00:25| And Cindy, I'm sorry, I'll go to roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18025)|
| 5:00:28| and I know that's where you are an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18028)|
| 5:00:38| The conditions of the road to their Beverly Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18038)|
| 5:00:42| I heard mention of a one lane bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18042)|
| 5:00:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18046)|
| 5:00:48| How wide is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18048)|
| 5:00:49| I personally haven't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18049)|
| 5:00:51| to get out to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18051)|
| 5:00:52| so I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18052)|
| 5:00:56| And I drive this site, it's a two lane bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18056)|
| 5:00:58| but it's a narrow two lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18058)|
| 5:01:00| I would estimate 18, 19 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18060)|
| 5:01:07| That's the most, it's a narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18067)|
| 5:01:12| Maybe it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18072)|
| 5:01:14| Fortunately, I've never, I drive to Lowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18074)|
| 5:01:17| that way all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18077)|
| 5:01:18| and fortunately, I've never met a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18078)|
| 5:01:22| My timing is great on that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18082)|
| 5:01:27| Well, no, there's lots of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18087)|
| 5:01:28| It's just people are very accommodating at the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18088)|
| 5:01:31| and often will slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18091)|
| 5:01:33| so that one vehicle can pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18093)|
| 5:01:36| without passing on the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18096)|
| 5:01:38| Okay, and other than the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18098)|
| 5:01:40| do you know the width of the rest of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18100)|
| 5:01:43| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18103)|
| 5:01:45| I was explaining earlier to Jim Stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18105)|
| 5:01:47| that unfortunately, most of our experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18107)|
| 5:01:49| with Beverly Road has been more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18109)|
| 5:01:52| in terms of working with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18112)|
| 5:01:54| when they were trying to make improvements at Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18114)|
| 5:01:56| which is in the city in Oxford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18116)|
| 5:01:58| so as to Beverly itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18118)|
| 5:02:02| I don't have any good information for you to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18122)|
| 5:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18125)|
| 5:02:07| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18127)|
| 5:02:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18128)|
| 5:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18129)|
| 5:02:09| While you're up there, Cindy, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18129)|
| 5:02:13| In regards to the line of sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18133)|
| 5:02:17| has this been looked at at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18137)|
| 5:02:20| Not by us, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18140)|
| 5:02:21| Typically during the rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18141)|
| 5:02:24| we do not go out and field visit those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18144)|
| 5:02:26| We only do the concepts and use on reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18146)|
| 5:02:29| in terms of our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18149)|
| 5:02:30| and then for final plats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18150)|
| 5:02:32| that's reviewed by the stormwater department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18152)|
| 5:02:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18154)|
| 5:02:36| I'm done with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18156)|
| 5:02:37| Mr. Green, we've had some discrepancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18157)|
| 5:02:41| on the discussion of sector plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18161)|
| 5:02:44| and I guess really my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18164)|
| 5:02:48| under the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18168)|
| 5:02:50| could someone put apartments on this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18170)|
| 5:02:53| and how many apartments could they put?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18173)|
| 5:02:56| Currently, there's approximately 21 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18176)|
| 5:02:59| zoned for RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18179)|
| 5:03:02| which is the residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18182)|
| 5:03:04| at a density of 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18184)|
| 5:03:06| so on that 21 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18186)|
| 5:03:08| they could do approximately 245| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18188)|
| 5:03:13| to 250 apartment use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18193)|
| 5:03:17| And that's not touching the industrial side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18197)|
| 5:03:19| That's not touching industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18199)|
| 5:03:20| The residential is not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18200)|
| 5:03:22| in the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18202)|
| 5:03:23| and it would be challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18203)|
| 5:03:27| likely to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18207)|
| 5:03:28| but it could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18208)|
| 5:03:31| But that wouldn't come before commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18211)|
| 5:03:33| or that would just be a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18213)|
| 5:03:35| and a plan and you're out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18215)|
| 5:03:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18218)|
| 5:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18219)|
| 5:03:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18221)|
| 5:03:46| Mr. Green, how much of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18226)|
| 5:03:49| is industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18229)|
| 5:03:49| I looked at it and I didn't get an exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18229)|
| 5:03:52| but it looks like most of it is industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18232)|
| 5:03:54| Most of it, I think there's a total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18234)|
| 5:03:57| let me get all my numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18237)|
| 5:04:00| There's a total of approximately 80 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18240)|
| 5:04:03| so with 21 being zoned RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18243)|
| 5:04:06| there's approximately 60 acres zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18246)|
| 5:04:11| And I believe this was from the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18251)|
| 5:04:13| when industrial zoning followed the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18253)|
| 5:04:17| regardless of the characteristics of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18257)|
| 5:04:21| I think one time before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18261)|
| 5:04:23| when I was on the MPC before 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18263)|
| 5:04:25| the first years before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18265)|
| 5:04:27| we looked at that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18267)|
| 5:04:29| because of the flooding out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18269)|
| 5:04:31| and I think it's still flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18271)|
| 5:04:32| Nothing's ever been taken care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18272)|
| 5:04:34| but the only way we can take care of flooding out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18274)|
| 5:04:37| is to zone it in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18277)|
| 5:04:40| to where we can address that issue on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18280)|
| 5:04:46| Right now, is it industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18286)|
| 5:04:48| We don't have any mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18288)|
| 5:04:51| of taking care of the flooding out there now, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18291)|
| 5:04:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18294)|
| 5:04:55| Okay, if we don't have any more use on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18295)|
| 5:05:01| and you just have to raise your hand, Cindy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18301)|
| 5:05:04| oh, back there is Mr. Snowden, is he awake yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18304)|
| 5:05:08| But anyway, if there's no more demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18308)|
| 5:05:13| or use on the road right now, as it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18313)|
| 5:05:18| would we do anything to widen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18318)|
| 5:05:20| or make it better right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18320)|
| 5:05:23| It's a city road, you can't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18323)|
| 5:05:25| Well, we can't do it, it's a city road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18325)|
| 5:05:26| so the city would have to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18326)|
| 5:05:30| And right now, it's taking care of the traffic out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18330)|
| 5:05:33| that issue, but if you rezoned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18333)|
| 5:05:37| you would have to do a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18337)|
| 5:05:39| if it went to that stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18339)|
| 5:05:42| which would tell you whether you had to widen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18342)|
| 5:05:45| where you had to take care of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18345)|
| 5:05:48| And I think where the flooding's at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18348)|
| 5:05:49| is where the water goes underneath the road now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18349)|
| 5:05:53| is it not correct, Ms. Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18353)|
| 5:05:56| I don't go out there much anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18356)|
| 5:05:57| I used to live close by there and see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18357)|
| 5:06:01| The flooding is all up and down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18361)|
| 5:06:03| When it rains a lot, even the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18363)|
| 5:06:05| has to come back and put riprap under their track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18365)|
| 5:06:08| to keep it from washing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18368)|
| 5:06:10| And Mr. Paris, where he saved the children from drowning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18370)|
| 5:06:14| it was in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18374)|
| 5:06:16| Okay, so it goes all the way up and down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18376)|
| 5:06:19| Okay, so you'd have to have an engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18379)|
| 5:06:21| to take a look at that with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18381)|
| 5:06:23| to see how you could reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18383)|
| 5:06:25| or mitigate the flooding that's in that area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18385)|
| 5:06:29| But if we leave it like it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18389)|
| 5:06:33| this was in 2000 when I went off MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18393)|
| 5:06:37| Here it is 18 years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18397)|
| 5:06:40| and nothing's really been done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18400)|
| 5:06:45| And it's in the city now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18405)|
| 5:06:47| But anyway, it's always been in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18407)|
| 5:06:49| But anyway, and in industrial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18409)|
| 5:06:53| I mean, there is so many uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18413)|
| 5:06:55| that if they wanted to take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18415)|
| 5:06:57| and make some money off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18417)|
| 5:06:58| there is some very interesting uses for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18418)|
| 5:07:06| And it's almost two and a half pages of usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18426)|
| 5:07:13| under industrial zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18433)|
| 5:07:15| that you could do almost anything you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18435)|
| 5:07:17| on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18437)|
| 5:07:19| And I don't know how we address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18439)|
| 5:07:24| I think that industrial zoning is wrong in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18444)|
| 5:07:29| and it has to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18449)|
| 5:07:31| But I don't see any agricultural zoning in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18451)|
| 5:07:34| except for the very back end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18454)|
| 5:07:37| Is that correct, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18457)|
| 5:07:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18459)|
| 5:07:41| So there's just very little bit of agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18461)|
| 5:07:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18464)|
| 5:07:47| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18467)|
| 5:07:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18469)|
| 5:07:51| There's a few things I want to bring back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18471)|
| 5:07:56| First of all, in terms of the roads and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18476)|
| 5:08:00| my parents moved out in that area in the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18480)|
| 5:08:04| And so I was born in 62 and I'm 56 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18484)|
| 5:08:10| And so the best I can remember in 56 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18490)|
| 5:08:14| there's been nothing done to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18494)|
| 5:08:17| It's probably since whenever the city put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18497)|
| 5:08:22| The city has no future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18502)|
| 5:08:25| They have nothing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18505)|
| 5:08:26| And we have our city councilman, Lorne Rider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18506)|
| 5:08:29| out here who represents that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18509)|
| 5:08:30| There's nothing in the books anywhere that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18510)|
| 5:08:35| they're going to do anything about this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18515)|
| 5:08:37| So let me just back up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18517)|
| 5:08:40| we've all received many, many emails in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18520)|
| 5:08:46| to this sector plan and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18526)|
| 5:08:50| We also got a letter from Norfolk Southern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18530)|
| 5:08:54| And, you know, the railroad is very concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18534)|
| 5:08:58| They normally don't get into any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18538)|
| 5:09:01| But we have a letter from them, from them opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18541)|
| 5:09:05| And also they have so much right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18545)|
| 5:09:08| which leads right over into where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18548)|
| 5:09:11| they had wanted to put the road into this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18551)|
| 5:09:17| We've also had letters from area neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18557)|
| 5:09:21| We've had Fountain City Town Hall, Fairmont Emberlin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18561)|
| 5:09:24| and Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18564)|
| 5:09:26| And that's just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18566)|
| 5:09:29| And the only issue that's before us right now on this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18569)|
| 5:09:33| is the sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18573)|
| 5:09:39| So I think Mrs. Rowe very much described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18579)|
| 5:09:45| what the sector plan involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18585)|
| 5:09:49| And also, as I've stated, I've lived in this area 56 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18589)|
| 5:09:55| And I go across that way probably every two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18595)|
| 5:10:02| in all kinds of traffic at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18602)|
| 5:10:04| different times of the days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18604)|
| 5:10:06| Just the other day, which I find this interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18606)|
| 5:10:09| that the bridge got brought up, I was in my Jeep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18609)|
| 5:10:14| and I literally had to stop because a car came on through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18614)|
| 5:10:18| on that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18618)|
| 5:10:20| And that's one of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18620)|
| 5:10:21| So I'm thinking, OK, we're not going to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18621)|
| 5:10:24| to the roads there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18624)|
| 5:10:27| But we're going to allow this much traffic to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18627)|
| 5:10:31| Even though there are 21 acres that's zoned RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18631)|
| 5:10:39| that still doesn't mean that there are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18639)|
| 5:10:41| 21 acres that's really developed to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18641)|
| 5:10:47| this type of subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18647)|
| 5:10:50| Also, it's gone 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18650)|
| 5:10:57| I have not had one single person call me to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18657)|
| 5:11:02| that they thought this was a great deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18662)|
| 5:11:04| good for this district in terms of housing or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18664)|
| 5:11:11| There's a reason why this property has been for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18671)|
| 5:11:15| for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18675)|
| 5:11:16| And do any of you all, I mean, or any of my commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18676)|
| 5:11:26| colleagues, are you not asking why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18686)|
| 5:11:29| Why has there only been this one offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18689)|
| 5:11:32| And the offer has been from a person who has never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18692)|
| 5:11:37| developed any property before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18697)|
| 5:11:40| That should be some big red lights right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18700)|
| 5:11:44| for all of us to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18704)|
| 5:11:46| I support MPC's staff, their professional recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18706)|
| 5:11:51| They're a paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18711)|
| 5:11:55| I have never had anything that I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18715)|
| 5:11:58| of that could be such a huge issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18718)|
| 5:12:05| in completely wiping out a whole district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18725)|
| 5:12:11| The city has spent thousands and thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18731)|
| 5:12:15| of dollars trying to fix Emerland Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18735)|
| 5:12:19| Fairmont Boulevard, on down in Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18739)|
| 5:12:21| in this Oakwood, Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18741)|
| 5:12:23| and the whole area down Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18743)|
| 5:12:25| Watts Creek, this development will impact Watts Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18745)|
| 5:12:30| And there's, I don't know how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18750)|
| 5:12:35| I mean, listen, I drive through there every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18755)|
| 5:12:37| and it floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18757)|
| 5:12:40| You know, we're not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18760)|
| 5:12:42| Most of the time people that come up here and oppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18762)|
| 5:12:44| they're opposed to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18764)|
| 5:12:46| We are not opposed to having development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18766)|
| 5:12:49| We are for what the MPC recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18769)|
| 5:12:53| and that's what I'm asking for you all to think of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18773)|
| 5:12:58| We have to vote on the sector plan first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18778)|
| 5:13:00| before we go into the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18780)|
| 5:13:03| And so for my vote right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18783)|
| 5:13:07| to let my colleagues know how I am on this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18787)|
| 5:13:13| that I want to make two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18793)|
| 5:13:16| And the first is to deny the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18796)|
| 5:13:22| leaving the agriculture designation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18802)|
| 5:13:26| And then my second one for tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18806)|
| 5:13:28| is going to approve planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18808)|
| 5:13:30| at a density of one, up to one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18810)|
| 5:13:34| as the professional staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18814)|
| 5:13:36| Point of order, you can't get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18816)|
| 5:13:39| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18819)|
| 5:13:41| Well, I'm just letting you all know how I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18821)|
| 5:13:46| and what I think tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18826)|
| 5:13:47| So you don't have to wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18827)|
| 5:13:50| how the person in the district too thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18830)|
| 5:13:53| So are there any more lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18833)|
| 5:13:57| Are hues okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18837)|
| 5:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18838)|
| 5:13:59| Well, I was going to call for us to do the sector plan vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18839)|
| 5:14:06| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18846)|
| 5:14:08| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18848)|
| 5:14:09| One thing I was just curious about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18849)|
| 5:14:11| when we see the sector plan in ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18851)|
| 5:14:14| how common is it really in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18854)|
| 5:14:16| that we see an ag sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18856)|
| 5:14:19| that includes inside of it actual zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18859)|
| 5:14:21| for both for industrial and general residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18861)|
| 5:14:25| I just had not come across this very, very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18865)|
| 5:14:29| So is that something that we see frequently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18869)|
| 5:14:33| I mean, based on your experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18873)|
| 5:14:35| how often does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18875)|
| 5:14:37| Not frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18877)|
| 5:14:38| And I would say that's largely because landless challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18878)|
| 5:14:43| is not typically zoned industrial and RV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18883)|
| 5:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18887)|
| 5:14:49| Again, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18889)|
| 5:14:52| we try to balance what we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18892)|
| 5:14:55| is the best development potential for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18895)|
| 5:14:59| with the existing zoning and uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18899)|
| 5:15:02| And often we try to envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18902)|
| 5:15:05| what is best for the county with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18905)|
| 5:15:07| And that may not match the current zoning of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18907)|
| 5:15:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18912)|
| 5:15:13| So we talk about a significant error on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18913)|
| 5:15:18| I think Taylor had brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18918)|
| 5:15:21| I don't know if it qualifies as a significant error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18921)|
| 5:15:23| but it just struck me as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18923)|
| 5:15:25| that didn't quite match up when I saw the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18925)|
| 5:15:27| and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18927)|
| 5:15:29| And I guess the question there is what is the error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18929)|
| 5:15:32| Is the sector plan the error or is the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18932)|
| 5:15:35| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18935)|
| 5:15:36| Yeah, that's kind of what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18936)|
| 5:15:38| I mean, having driven the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18938)|
| 5:15:39| I mean, there was some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18939)|
| 5:15:40| You know, farming is not determined by use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18940)|
| 5:15:43| or excuse me, an ag zone is not necessarily determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18943)|
| 5:15:46| by the use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18946)|
| 5:15:47| It's actually the way the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18947)|
| 5:15:50| It's not necessarily mean you gotta have cows out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18950)|
| 5:15:53| But although there was some use adjacent to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18953)|
| 5:15:57| So when I did my drive through and walked around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18957)|
| 5:16:00| it just struck me as there was a little bit of ag next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18960)|
| 5:16:03| There was industrial catty corner to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18963)|
| 5:16:05| And it all was, I guess, a little bit confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18965)|
| 5:16:11| rightfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18971)|
| 5:16:14| But I understand where Taylor's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18974)|
| 5:16:16| mentioning the error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18976)|
| 5:16:17| Because where I saw error was it just didn't quite seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18977)|
| 5:16:20| to be a matchup between the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18980)|
| 5:16:25| and the actual zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18985)|
| 5:16:27| So that was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18987)|
| 5:16:28| And one of our challenges, we look at property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18988)|
| 5:16:32| and quite frankly, we often think of ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18992)|
| 5:16:36| as more one unit per acre residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18996)|
| 5:16:39| as opposed to real agricultural use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=18999)|
| 5:16:41| And I think often in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19001)|
| 5:16:43| ag is seen as a holding pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19003)|
| 5:16:46| until we look at the development potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19006)|
| 5:16:49| of the property more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19009)|
| 5:16:50| There were three pre-zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19010)|
| 5:16:54| Okay, Taylor, I got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19014)|
| 5:16:56| All right, and this is more of a density question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19016)|
| 5:16:59| I think when this was first before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19019)|
| 5:17:02| I think the owner or the person with the option on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19022)|
| 5:17:07| had said at one point, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19027)|
| 5:17:09| that 2.75 was something that he could work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19029)|
| 5:17:12| But I know in your letter that you came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19032)|
| 5:17:14| to us, you said 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19034)|
| 5:17:17| That's, you know, this thing's gotten a lot of heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19037)|
| 5:17:19| So I guess I was frankly surprised to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19039)|
| 5:17:21| after all the stuff that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19041)|
| 5:17:24| I mean, look at a full room here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19044)|
| 5:17:25| that you actually came back and asked for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19045)|
| 5:17:28| after it came through MPC at 2.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19048)|
| 5:17:32| So if you don't mind, just kind of help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19052)|
| 5:17:33| kind of give me a big picture on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19053)|
| 5:17:35| and where we're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19055)|
| 5:17:36| And I'll offer my best understanding of explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19056)|
| 5:17:39| is my involvement was right before the May meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19059)|
| 5:17:43| where we requested a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19063)|
| 5:17:46| My understanding is Mr. Mormon's involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19066)|
| 5:17:49| was maybe right at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19069)|
| 5:17:53| or a little bit before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19073)|
| 5:17:55| So Mr. Gurnard, Mr. Gurnard is not an experienced developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19075)|
| 5:17:59| That is nothing to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19079)|
| 5:18:04| He submitted the application and was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19084)|
| 5:18:07| that he needed to put a density request on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19087)|
| 5:18:08| and he put five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19088)|
| 5:18:10| And then when he came to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19090)|
| 5:18:13| he was asked for a density and he said 2.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19093)|
| 5:18:16| But I think after consulting and retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19096)|
| 5:18:19| Mr. Mormon's services and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19099)|
| 5:18:21| the actual impact of the infrastructure cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19101)|
| 5:18:24| on this challenging site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19104)|
| 5:18:26| that in reality to be able to properly do this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19106)|
| 5:18:32| and to make it feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19112)|
| 5:18:34| a density of more of 3.1 would be necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19114)|
| 5:18:39| which results in the 170 unit, 172 unit mix, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19119)|
| 5:18:45| And that's my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19125)|
| 5:18:48| I'm being told that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19128)|
| 5:18:49| All right, well, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19129)|
| 5:18:51| because it didn't quite seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19131)|
| 5:18:54| I think it was the, I don't want to refer to Mr. Gurnard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19134)|
| 5:18:58| uneducated determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19138)|
| 5:18:59| but lack of experience determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19139)|
| 5:19:01| And again, Mr. Gurnard, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19141)|
| 5:19:06| this is his option to follow through on this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19146)|
| 5:19:09| and that's what he's requesting here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19149)|
| 5:19:12| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19152)|
| 5:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19153)|
| 5:19:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19154)|
| 5:19:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19155)|
| 5:19:17| Mr. Green, the track is 88.5 acres, correct, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19157)|
| 5:19:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19161)|
| 5:19:22| Okay, so how many acres will be used to determine the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19162)|
| 5:19:27| In determining the density, the flood area is excluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19167)|
| 5:19:33| which is, I've turned the head of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19173)|
| 5:19:41| 18.85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19181)|
| 5:19:42| 18, yeah, so 18 acres would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19182)|
| 5:19:47| Removed, okay, so he's got 70 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19187)|
| 5:19:49| and he's saying 70 times 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19189)|
| 5:19:55| Well, no, if you have 88 and you subtract 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19195)|
| 5:19:57| isn't that 70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19197)|
| 5:19:58| By total, it's 80.39 and then there's 18.8 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19198)|
| 5:20:02| in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19202)|
| 5:20:09| And I believe Mr. Moore stated that in doing a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19209)|
| 5:20:15| there was actually 78 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19215)|
| 5:20:17| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19217)|
| 5:20:19| Okay, so you're saying 78 acres times 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19219)|
| 5:20:27| 78 minus the 18 is 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19227)|
| 5:20:29| Okay, 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19229)|
| 5:20:30| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19230)|
| 5:20:35| on page 1525 of today's agenda, it says area counted toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19235)|
| 5:20:41| density is 61.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19241)|
| 5:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19245)|
| 5:20:45| Excuse me, 61.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19245)|
| 5:20:50| And look on page eight, it gives the label.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19250)|
| 5:20:55| So you're saying 170, Mr. Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19255)|
| 5:20:58| you're saying 175 homes and 200, what is the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19258)|
| 5:21:06| You said 17 and I threw up the T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19266)|
| 5:21:08| Okay, okay, 172 homes and MPC is saying basically the 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19268)|
| 5:21:17| And change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19277)|
| 5:21:18| Based on not mending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19278)|
| 5:21:22| The staff, the Planning Commission recommendation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19282)|

| 5:21:30| That's the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19290)|
| 5:21:34| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19294)|
| 5:21:39| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19299)|
| 5:21:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19301)|
| 5:21:41| Ms. Rowe, can I call you Jamie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19301)|
| 5:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19306)|
| 5:21:47| Jamie, you made the statement a moment ago that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19307)|
| 5:21:51| the sector plan should be PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19311)|
| 5:21:54| Did I hear that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19314)|
| 5:21:55| No, we don't have a problem with PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19315)|
| 5:21:57| What we have a problem with is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19317)|
| 5:21:59| Right, I think we should, my opinion is the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19319)|
| 5:22:02| should be changed to PR to get rid of the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19322)|
| 5:22:04| because the industrial probably came in 1960s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19324)|
| 5:22:07| because of the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19327)|
| 5:22:09| If I could just quote one sentence from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19329)|
| 5:22:13| It says the industrial zoning was established decades ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19333)|
| 5:22:17| because it was along a railroad corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19337)|
| 5:22:19| And we have some people in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19339)|
| 5:22:21| that have railroad going through their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19341)|
| 5:22:23| and that's still called industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19343)|
| 5:22:25| because they have a right-of-way on each side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19345)|
| 5:22:28| So it's zoned industrial for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19348)|
| 5:22:30| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19350)|
| 5:22:31| And that's why we need to look at our zonings in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19351)|
| 5:22:34| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19354)|
| 5:22:36| So I think the sector plan should be changed to PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19356)|
| 5:22:38| get rid of the industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19358)|
| 5:22:40| And then the big question is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19360)|
| 5:22:43| Do I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19363)|
| 5:22:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19365)|
| 5:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19365)|
| 5:22:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19368)|
| 5:22:51| I guess first of all, I want to ask a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19371)|
| 5:22:56| We're talking about somebody that has an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19376)|
| 5:22:58| on somebody else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19378)|
| 5:23:00| And we're talking about being totally different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19380)|
| 5:23:04| than the request and we can lock them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19384)|
| 5:23:07| for a long period of time to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19387)|
| 5:23:09| So I think we need to ask the representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19389)|
| 5:23:11| I guess Taylor, if something has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19391)|
| 5:23:15| and the vote's not announced, do you want to rescind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19395)|
| 5:23:19| Because you'll hear the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19399)|
| 5:23:20| but once the vote's announced, it's permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19400)|
| 5:23:22| and that landowner is stuck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19402)|
| 5:23:25| So is that what you want to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19405)|
| 5:23:26| or whatever you get, you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19406)|
| 5:23:29| The landowner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19409)|
| 5:23:33| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19413)|
| 5:23:37| My understanding is at the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19417)|
| 5:23:40| they did not calculate the density based on the 61.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19420)|
| 5:23:45| The density of 2.75 was calculated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19425)|
| 5:23:48| as Commissioner Schoonmaker was factoring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19428)|
| 5:23:51| at the 78 acres, which would have resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19431)|
| 5:23:55| in a total density of around 195 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19435)|
| 5:24:01| I don't think that's going to be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19441)|
| 5:24:04| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19444)|
| 5:24:04| What I'm saying is if you factor in our increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19444)|
| 5:24:08| to 3.1, we're still under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19448)|
| 5:24:11| what NPC commissioners had approved overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19451)|
| 5:24:15| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19455)|
| 5:24:16| I guess my next, oh, go ahead, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19456)|
| 5:24:21| The density will be addressed if we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19461)|
| 5:24:24| to the rezoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19464)|
| 5:24:26| I'd like to focus commission's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19466)|
| 5:24:27| back on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19467)|
| 5:24:29| And if and when we get to the rezoning portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19469)|
| 5:24:33| a commission with the assistance of NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19473)|
| 5:24:37| and myself even can be clear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19477)|
| 5:24:41| in the motion even what number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19481)|
| 5:24:45| that you're able to put on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19485)|
| 5:24:48| and leave the calculation aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19488)|
| 5:24:50| If the commission wants to use the calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19490)|
| 5:24:53| they can provide for a certain number of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19493)|
| 5:24:56| to calculate the density on and then provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19496)|
| 5:24:58| a certain number of units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19498)|
| 5:24:59| But however they do it, that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19499)|
| 5:25:01| addressed at the zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19501)|
| 5:25:03| I got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19503)|
| 5:25:06| Michelle, I'm really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19506)|
| 5:25:10| I guess I want to get your feedback on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19510)|
| 5:25:13| I'm really concerned about the discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19513)|
| 5:25:15| I mean, apartments are a hot commodity right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19515)|
| 5:25:18| And if you do nothing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19518)|
| 5:25:24| and you got, I mean, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19524)|
| 5:25:25| that it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19525)|
| 5:25:26| But I mean, are you, is the district willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19526)|
| 5:25:31| to accept even if nothing, if he turns around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19531)|
| 5:25:34| and walks away tonight and walks in down tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19534)|
| 5:25:37| and turns in a plan and asks for a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19537)|
| 5:25:40| there's a couple hundred apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19540)|
| 5:25:43| I mean, that's the risk that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19543)|
| 5:25:44| that's a serious risk that I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19544)|
| 5:25:46| I share the same concerns about the property that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19546)|
| 5:25:49| But there's a risk of, there's a serious risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19549)|
| 5:25:53| of an apartment complex showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19553)|
| 5:25:55| And I think that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19555)|
| 5:25:57| that we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19557)|
| 5:25:59| Again, I'm not trying to sway anybody's votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19559)|
| 5:26:01| because I'm seriously concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19561)|
| 5:26:02| about this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19562)|
| 5:26:04| I used to drive it quite a bit in my youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19564)|
| 5:26:06| but gosh, to allow 245 apartments there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19566)|
| 5:26:13| would be a lot worse than 160 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19573)|
| 5:26:16| So I think we need to find out really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19576)|
| 5:26:18| where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19578)|
| 5:26:22| Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19582)|
| 5:26:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19583)|
| 5:26:25| There seems to be ever-changing market conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19585)|
| 5:26:27| in Knox County, and there's more pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19587)|
| 5:26:29| towards finding these, we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19589)|
| 5:26:31| a hard piece of land to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19591)|
| 5:26:35| As the market continues to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19595)|
| 5:26:37| and there's more and more pressure on housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19597)|
| 5:26:40| doesn't that lead that someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19600)|
| 5:26:41| this property may get developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19601)|
| 5:26:43| And that's one reason why I'm leaning towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19603)|
| 5:26:45| at least changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19605)|
| 5:26:47| leaving the density aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19607)|
| 5:26:48| is I don't think that the RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19608)|
| 5:26:53| is appropriate zoning for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19613)|
| 5:26:55| nor is the industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19615)|
| 5:26:57| I agree with that last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19617)|
| 5:27:05| Trying to envision apartments on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19625)|
| 5:27:09| is challenging for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19629)|
| 5:27:10| and I spent 10 years doing site plans for developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19630)|
| 5:27:13| and this would be more challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19633)|
| 5:27:19| than as someone advising a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19639)|
| 5:27:24| than I would want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19644)|
| 5:27:27| Advise to develop for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19647)|
| 5:27:29| I think it's a very challenging piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19649)|
| 5:27:32| And with continued pressures and rarities of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19652)|
| 5:27:37| at some point, somebody may try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19657)|
| 5:27:39| Yes, well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19659)|
| 5:27:44| Commissioner Besseler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19664)|
| 5:27:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19666)|
| 5:27:49| I think Brad kind of has answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19669)|
| 5:27:54| some of my question for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19674)|
| 5:27:57| so as of right now, point blank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19677)|
| 5:28:01| somebody can go in with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19681)|
| 5:28:03| that will fit on that piece of property for apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19683)|
| 5:28:06| and they can get how many apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19686)|
| 5:28:08| You said 245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19688)|
| 5:28:14| Here's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19694)|
| 5:28:16| I sit on the CAC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19696)|
| 5:28:18| There is all kinds of money out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19698)|
| 5:28:20| from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19700)|
| 5:28:22| to help do low-income apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19702)|
| 5:28:26| Now, we can address the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19706)|
| 5:28:34| or we can leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19714)|
| 5:28:36| If you leave it as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19716)|
| 5:28:39| you all might have a problem out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19719)|
| 5:28:42| and it's not going to be because of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19722)|
| 5:28:45| It's because of the demand for those apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19725)|
| 5:28:49| And the way it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19729)|
| 5:28:52| they could walk out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19732)|
| 5:28:54| and go get a plan and submit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19734)|
| 5:28:57| and it doesn't go through you all, does it, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19737)|
| 5:29:00| No, and in terms of the tax credit apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19740)|
| 5:29:04| the site would not meet some of the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19744)|
| 5:29:06| for that with regard to transit access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19746)|
| 5:29:09| pedestrian access, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19749)|
| 5:29:10| So that level of apartment would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19750)|
| 5:29:12| and it would take someone with pretty deep pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19752)|
| 5:29:16| to develop the apartments on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19756)|
| 5:29:18| There's a few apartments on the side of 640| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19758)|
| 5:29:20| and Sharks Ridge that would probably differ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19760)|
| 5:29:22| with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19762)|
| 5:29:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19763)|
| 5:29:25| I just want to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19765)|
| 5:29:27| With enough money, any property can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19767)|
| 5:29:30| Or attempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19770)|
| 5:29:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19773)|
| 5:29:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19775)|
| 5:29:36| Mr. Green, I think what you just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19776)|
| 5:29:37| was the most valid point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19777)|
| 5:29:39| that a company that specializes in apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19779)|
| 5:29:45| this is not going to be their number one site to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19785)|
| 5:29:48| to put apartments on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19788)|
| 5:29:49| because if it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19789)|
| 5:29:51| this thing would have been developed 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19791)|
| 5:29:55| And to only be able to put apartments on the 21 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19795)|
| 5:29:59| you know, he's got another 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19799)|
| 5:30:01| then he's just got to leave forested then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19801)|
| 5:30:04| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19804)|
| 5:30:05| That's actually another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19805)|
| 5:30:09| depending on your calculations, about 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19809)|
| 5:30:12| 50 to 60 acres just to leave forested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19812)|
| 5:30:14| So really, this isn't even up for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19814)|
| 5:30:17| because I don't think any sharp apartment investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19817)|
| 5:30:22| would even look at this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19822)|
| 5:30:23| And that's why I think that you found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19823)|
| 5:30:25| that a lot of professional developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19825)|
| 5:30:28| have not even looked at this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19828)|
| 5:30:30| because of the constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19830)|
| 5:30:34| So anyways, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19834)|
| 5:30:39| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19839)|
| 5:30:40| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19840)|
| 5:30:43| I would like to ask Ms. Rowe to come back down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19843)|
| 5:30:47| And she definitely spokesperson for District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19847)|
| 5:30:55| and I would like to know what Ms. Rowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19855)|
| 5:30:58| and what she feels the District 2 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19858)|
| 5:31:01| in terms of changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19861)|
| 5:31:03| as what Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19863)|
| 5:31:06| and give your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19866)|
| 5:31:10| We think the sector plan amendment needs to be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19870)|
| 5:31:15| Deny the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19875)|
| 5:31:18| There's no legal basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19878)|
| 5:31:21| Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19881)|
| 5:31:26| Support the PR zoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19886)|
| 5:31:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19888)|
| 5:31:30| Can you get there without a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19890)|
| 5:31:32| You could get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19892)|
| 5:31:33| The Ag would allow the PR zoning at density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19893)|
| 5:31:36| of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19896)|
| 5:31:38| And only one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19898)|
| 5:31:39| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19899)|
| 5:31:39| Only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19899)|
| 5:31:40| One and only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19900)|
| 5:31:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19901)|
| 5:31:44| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19904)|
| 5:31:46| That's all I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19906)|
| 5:31:49| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19909)|
| 5:31:50| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19910)|
| 5:31:53| Yeah, I would like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19913)|
| 5:31:55| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19915)|
| 5:31:56| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19916)|
| 5:31:57| I'm confused, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19917)|
| 5:31:58| We got industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19918)|
| 5:32:00| Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19920)|
| 5:32:00| Is industrial and Ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19920)|
| 5:32:03| It's industrial zoning, but an Ag sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19923)|
| 5:32:07| Again, the sector plan designation, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19927)|
| 5:32:10| looked at what the most appropriate future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19930)|
| 5:32:13| and to guide future zoning requests and zoning actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19933)|
| 5:32:19| So we can go technically, we go 40 plus single homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19939)|
| 5:32:25| plus apartments if it's not changed to PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19945)|
| 5:32:31| The 21 acres are bar B could be developed for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19951)|
| 5:32:34| And that is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19954)|
| 5:32:35| 244 plus the rest of the Ag industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19955)|
| 5:32:39| Well, the industrial, no residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19959)|
| 5:32:43| is permitted in the industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19963)|
| 5:32:45| The challenge, you know, looking at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19965)|
| 5:32:48| the RB is some of the steeper slope that's in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19968)|
| 5:32:53| Mr. Gannard, how many acres is the Ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19973)|
| 5:32:57| Most of it's industrial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19977)|
| 5:33:00| Mr. Beene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19980)|
| 5:33:02| The Ag is actually outside, at the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19982)|
| 5:33:06| and I think it's outside the zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19986)|
| 5:33:09| Another property is zoned Ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19989)|
| 5:33:10| You've got 21 acres that is, by their calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19990)|
| 5:33:14| that is zoned RB, which would allow for 240 some units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19994)|
| 5:33:19| per his calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=19999)|
| 5:33:20| Then you've got 18 acres that is floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20000)|
| 5:33:23| which does not get considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20003)|
| 5:33:25| Then the balance of the property is zoned industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20005)|
| 5:33:27| and would still be available for industrial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20007)|
| 5:33:30| In your professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20010)|
| 5:33:33| would this ever be apartments there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20013)|
| 5:33:36| I am not in a position to say what would there ever be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20016)|
| 5:33:40| It would be a very challenging development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20020)|
| 5:33:42| but I've seen things done that in some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20022)|
| 5:33:46| very conventional zonings that I sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20026)|
| 5:33:48| and scratch my head and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20028)|
| 5:33:49| I can't believe these guys are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20029)|
| 5:33:51| It happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20031)|
| 5:33:53| Would I do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20033)|
| 5:33:54| No, sir, I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20034)|
| 5:33:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20036)|
| 5:34:03| In hindsight, I would ask you to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20043)|
| 5:34:05| Dean Hill Apartments and the retaining walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20045)|
| 5:34:08| around that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20048)|
| 5:34:08| You want to tell me a site can't be hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20048)|
| 5:34:11| think about Dean Hill Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20051)|
| 5:34:14| Are you familiar with Dean Hill Apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20054)|
| 5:34:23| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20063)|
| 5:34:25| Yes, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20065)|
| 5:34:30| to deny the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20070)|
| 5:34:32| leaving the agriculture designation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20072)|
| 5:34:37| Call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20077)|
| 5:34:41| Need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20081)|
| 5:34:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20083)|
| 5:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20099)|
| 5:35:00| We have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20100)|
| 5:35:03| The motion is to deny the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20103)|
| 5:35:08| Do a roll call vote, starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20108)|
| 5:35:14| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20114)|
| 5:35:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20115)|
| 5:35:16| Commissioner Gill votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20116)|
| 5:35:18| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20118)|
| 5:35:20| I vote to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20120)|
| 5:35:22| That would be a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20122)|
| 5:35:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20124)|
| 5:35:26| Commissioner Carringer votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20126)|
| 5:35:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20127)|
| 5:35:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20129)|
| 5:35:29| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20129)|
| 5:35:31| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20131)|
| 5:35:32| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20132)|

| 5:36:11| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20171)|
| 5:36:29| If you vote no, you join the six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20189)|
| 5:36:32| I can't hear you, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20192)|
| 5:36:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20193)|
| 5:36:33| Vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20193)|
| 5:36:34| You join the six people who voted to not pass the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20194)|
| 5:36:38| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20198)|
| 5:36:39| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20199)|
| 5:36:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20199)|
| 5:36:42| I'll join the noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20202)|
| 5:36:44| He says seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20204)|
| 5:36:45| Nystrom, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20205)|
| 5:36:46| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20206)|
| 5:36:50| We have a conundrum because we have just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20210)|
| 5:36:53| made a motion to deny that was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20213)|
| 5:36:56| That's not a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20216)|
| 5:36:57| So it's not a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20217)|
| 5:36:59| So explain that to us, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20219)|
| 5:37:01| In the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20221)|
| 5:37:06| So what the commission has done is there was a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20226)|
| 5:37:11| the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20231)|
| 5:37:12| That motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20232)|
| 5:37:14| In order for the commission to act, there has to be a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20234)|
| 5:37:18| and affirmative vote of the majority of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20238)|
| 5:37:22| So there needs to be, seeing that there's seven noes and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20242)|
| 5:37:27| yeses, there needs to be a motion to approve the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20247)|
| 5:37:31| plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20251)|
| 5:37:32| And those who, well, you can vote how you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20252)|
| 5:37:39| But in order to take action on this application, there needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20259)|
| 5:37:43| to be a motion, a second, and the affirmative vote of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20263)|
| 5:37:48| majority of the people, or a majority of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20268)|
| 5:37:51| Mr. Chair, if we remember in the previous action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20271)|
| 5:37:57| I could not, in my good faith, make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20277)|
| 5:38:04| That's why we have to have affirmative motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20284)|
| 5:38:08| And we've fallen in a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20288)|
| 5:38:11| No, all we need is another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20291)|
| 5:38:14| You didn't announce the vote, so it's not a good vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20294)|
| 5:38:17| You got to announce it because it makes it a negative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20297)|
| 5:38:27| Yeah, the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20307)|
| 5:38:40| The floor is back open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20320)|
| 5:38:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20337)|
| 5:38:59| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20339)|
| 5:39:01| Could you just offer some clarity to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20341)|
| 5:39:07| A motion was made to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20347)|
| 5:39:09| The motion failed, leaving us with a non-positive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20349)|
| 5:39:13| We need to have a positive motion in order to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20353)|
| 5:39:18| This stems from a city zoning matter at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20358)|
| 5:39:22| Royal Properties versus City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20362)|
| 5:39:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20364)|
| 5:39:26| I don't want to have the commission confused anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20366)|
| 5:39:29| and maybe I can add some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20369)|
| 5:39:32| When the commission makes a motion and it's properly seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20372)|
| 5:39:35| in order for that motion to carry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20375)|
| 5:39:37| there needs to be the affirmative vote of a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20377)|
| 5:39:40| Otherwise, the commission doesn't take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20380)|
| 5:39:42| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20382)|
| 5:39:44| But in order to act on an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20384)|
| 5:39:47| you've got to have a motion to second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20387)|
| 5:39:50| whether it's to approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20390)|
| 5:39:53| And that motion has to carry a majority of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20393)|
| 5:39:56| Otherwise, the commission takes no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20396)|
| 5:39:57| And that's what happened just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20397)|
| 5:39:59| You had a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20399)|
| 5:40:00| It failed to receive a vote of majority of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20400)|
| 5:40:04| and that motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20404)|
| 5:40:05| So the item is still before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20405)|
| 5:40:07| There needs to be another motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20407)|
| 5:40:09| and it needs to carry a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20409)|
| 5:40:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20412)|
| 5:40:24| This question is for Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20424)|
| 5:40:27| I'm just trying to read a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20427)|
| 5:40:32| that would be reflective of what's written under MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20432)|
| 5:40:36| which has to be stated in the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20436)|
| 5:40:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20438)|
| 5:40:42| I don't want us to get hung up too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20442)|
| 5:40:45| on whether it's a positive or negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20445)|
| 5:40:48| There was just a motion to deny the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20448)|
| 5:40:52| If that motion had carried a majority of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20452)|
| 5:40:55| the sector plan application would have been denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20455)|
| 5:40:59| and that would have been the end of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20459)|
| 5:41:00| because commission took action by affirmative vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20460)|
| 5:41:02| of a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20462)|
| 5:41:04| Because the commission didn't act on the motion by majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20464)|
| 5:41:09| there needs to be another motion made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20469)|
| 5:41:11| and it needs to receive the affirmative vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20471)|
| 5:41:14| of a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20474)|
| 5:41:17| Any member of commission can move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20477)|
| 5:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20483)|
| 5:41:23| Commissioner Carringer, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20483)|
| 5:41:29| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20489)|
| 5:41:30| Well, I'm just really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20490)|
| 5:41:36| I know that making it PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20496)|
| 5:41:40| so changing the sector plan to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20500)|
| 5:41:49| is what's been recommended by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20509)|
| 5:41:56| But everybody's wanting us to, or the crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20516)|
| 5:42:00| the opposition wants us to deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20520)|
| 5:42:03| But then they said they wanted PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20523)|
| 5:42:06| So I don't know that we're in a good spot on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20526)|
| 5:42:14| because you specifically said we want PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20534)|
| 5:42:21| we want you to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20541)|
| 5:42:22| You can't have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20542)|
| 5:42:27| The ag sector plan designation would allow PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20547)|
| 5:42:31| to then see one unit per acre and one unit only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20551)|
| 5:42:34| and the LDR sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20554)|
| 5:42:37| would allow plan residential of a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20557)|
| 5:42:40| between one and five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20560)|
| 5:42:43| The LDR designation provides the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20563)|
| 5:42:45| with more leeway in assigning that PR zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20565)|
| 5:42:51| I'm going to say something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20571)|
| 5:42:54| I would like to see the sector plan changed to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20574)|
| 5:42:57| where there are some more controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20577)|
| 5:42:58| over this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20578)|
| 5:43:00| Then we can move on to the density issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20580)|
| 5:43:03| and we have the ability to limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20583)|
| 5:43:08| Ms. Rowe, do you care to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20588)|
| 5:43:14| I'm just the teensiest bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20594)|
| 5:43:16| Welcome to the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20596)|
| 5:43:17| The staff recommended denial of the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20597)|
| 5:43:23| and that's what's before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20603)|
| 5:43:25| The commission though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20605)|
| 5:43:26| That's what we were asking for because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20606)|
| 5:43:30| Staff recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20610)|
| 5:43:32| That's what I said, the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20612)|
| 5:43:34| No, sir, I said the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20614)|
| 5:43:37| The staff recommended it, the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20617)|
| 5:43:41| And you would have to choose one of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20621)|
| 5:43:44| if you pass the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20624)|
| 5:43:46| And they said none of them worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20626)|
| 5:43:51| And my motion was to go along with what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20631)|
| 5:43:55| to deny the sector plan saying what the MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20635)|
| 5:44:00| The MPC recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20640)|
| 5:44:02| The staff recommended disapproval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20642)|
| 5:44:03| Well, the staff, staff, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20643)|
| 5:44:06| Two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20646)|
| 5:44:07| I mean, I thought Ms. Rowe explained that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20647)|
| 5:44:10| before I made the motion that she made that clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20650)|
| 5:44:13| on what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20653)|
| 5:44:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20657)|
| 5:44:17| I think that that was the motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20657)|
| 5:44:20| the requested sector plan amendment to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20660)|
| 5:44:23| and that motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20663)|
| 5:44:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20666)|
| 5:44:27| So now there has to be another action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20667)|
| 5:44:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20669)|
| 5:44:35| Mr. Caring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20675)|
| 5:44:36| Wouldn't need to make...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20676)|
| 5:44:38| I mean, I can make a motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20678)|
| 5:44:42| What do I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20682)|
| 5:44:42| What do we get to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20682)|
| 5:44:45| At this point, there are only two possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20685)|
| 5:44:48| for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20688)|
| 5:44:49| Either you approve this sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20689)|
| 5:44:51| or you initiate a subsequent...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20691)|
| 5:44:55| You initiate your own sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20695)|
| 5:44:56| And I haven't even heard that discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20696)|
| 5:45:00| You know, there might be another motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20700)|
| 5:45:03| But the commission has already voted on a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20703)|
| 5:45:06| I wouldn't imagine if there is any more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20706)|
| 5:45:09| on the item to sway the vote one way or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20709)|
| 5:45:13| that that motion would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20713)|
| 5:45:16| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20716)|
| 5:45:17| Yeah, there has to be another motion in a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20717)|
| 5:45:20| before you take another vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20720)|
| 5:45:22| And you have to take another vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20722)|
| 5:45:23| in order to act on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20723)|
| 5:45:26| Scott Farmer, 1701 Moorland Boulevard here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20726)|
| 5:45:30| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20730)|
| 5:45:31| Some of the confusion I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20731)|
| 5:45:33| the sector plan currently zones it agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20733)|
| 5:45:38| It doesn't have to be changed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20738)|
| 5:45:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20740)|
| 5:45:41| No, the sector plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20741)|
| 5:45:44| The sector plan establishes requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20744)|
| 5:45:49| for future land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20749)|
| 5:45:51| So what is it currently zoned in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20751)|
| 5:45:54| It's currently zoned industrial and RVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20754)|
| 5:45:57| There's two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20757)|
| 5:45:58| The sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20758)|
| 5:45:59| What's the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20759)|
| 5:46:00| Like they're voting on the sector plan designation as agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20760)|
| 5:46:04| So currently the sector plan is agriculture for that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20764)|
| 5:46:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20768)|
| 5:46:09| And so what you're trying to do is to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20769)|
| 5:46:11| from the agricultural designation to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20771)|
| 5:46:16| is what the proposal is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20776)|
| 5:46:18| That's the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20778)|
| 5:46:20| That's the request from the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20780)|
| 5:46:23| because they want to change it from agricultural to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20783)|
| 5:46:26| So if the motion's denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20786)|
| 5:46:28| it will stay sector plan agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20788)|
| 5:46:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20791)|
| 5:46:31| There's no agricultural in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20791)|
| 5:46:34| That's what I do with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20794)|
| 5:46:34| This is only on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20794)|
| 5:46:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20796)|
| 5:46:36| That's the confusion is everybody's looking at going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20796)|
| 5:46:38| no, it's zoning for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20798)|
| 5:46:40| The sector plan has no effect on the zoning currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20800)|
| 5:46:43| It's just a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20803)|
| 5:46:43| This current application to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20803)|
| 5:46:45| is just to change it from agricultural to the LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20805)|
| 5:46:50| on the sector plan side only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20810)|
| 5:46:52| He's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20812)|
| 5:46:53| I know, but actually I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20813)|
| 5:46:56| But the confusion is they don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20816)|
| 5:46:57| like they want to get it changed to the agricultural plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20817)|
| 5:47:00| but it already sets on the sector side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20820)|
| 5:47:02| It's already agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20822)|
| 5:47:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20826)|
| 5:47:07| The sector plan designation is currently agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20827)|
| 5:47:10| Which then can be controlled by the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20830)|
| 5:47:11| to keep it at one unit or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20831)|
| 5:47:15| I think the things that we're afraid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20835)|
| 5:47:17| is the actual zoning that's on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20837)|
| 5:47:20| requires no review on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20840)|
| 5:47:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20842)|
| 5:47:22| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20842)|
| 5:47:23| So that's my curiosity was, but then you will get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20843)|
| 5:47:27| If we deny the sector plan right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20847)|
| 5:47:29| he walks away with the zoning that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20849)|
| 5:47:32| And he can do what he wants to with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20852)|
| 5:47:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20853)|
| 5:47:34| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20854)|
| 5:47:35| So the vote is between sector plan agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20855)|
| 5:47:38| or switch it to sector plan LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20858)|
| 5:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20860)|
| 5:47:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20862)|
| 5:47:44| You hadn't even gotten to the rezoning part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20864)|
| 5:47:46| He's talking about you walk away with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20866)|
| 5:47:48| You don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20868)|
| 5:47:49| This is the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20869)|
| 5:47:51| Then you vote on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20871)|
| 5:47:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20872)|
| 5:47:54| So they're two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20874)|
| 5:47:55| And this is an agricultural designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20875)|
| 5:47:58| that we would like to see left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20878)|
| 5:48:00| And deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20880)|
| 5:48:02| because you don't have one of these four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20882)|
| 5:48:04| If you do decide to go with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20884)|
| 5:48:06| you have got to choose one of these four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20886)|
| 5:48:09| Ms. Rowe, I heard you make that statement earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20889)|
| 5:48:12| that the commission has to make an affirmative choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20892)|
| 5:48:18| And it has to be stated in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20898)|
| 5:48:19| I'm not aware of that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20899)|
| 5:48:23| They don't have to state the reason why they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20903)|
| 5:48:28| I think you would agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20908)|
| 5:48:29| It just has to be some form of material evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20909)|
| 5:48:31| within the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20911)|
| 5:48:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20912)|
| 5:48:32| And that can be found anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20912)|
| 5:48:33| The motion has got to say nothing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20913)|
| 5:48:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20916)|
| 5:48:38| Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20918)|
| 5:48:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20920)|
| 5:48:41| Right now what we have before us is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20921)|
| 5:48:44| we have a piece of property that has RB, industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20924)|
| 5:48:48| and is there any ag to it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20928)|
| 5:48:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20931)|
| 5:48:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20931)|
| 5:48:53| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20933)|
| 5:48:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20934)|
| 5:48:55| So the sector plan is saying with the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20935)|
| 5:48:59| from the MPC, commission is to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20939)|
| 5:49:06| what's before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20946)|
| 5:49:08| The commission's recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20948)|
| 5:49:11| the sector plan designation to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20951)|
| 5:49:14| OK, to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20954)|
| 5:49:17| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20957)|
| 5:49:18| So that's what's before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20958)|
| 5:49:20| That's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20960)|
| 5:49:22| Somebody's got to make a motion to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20962)|
| 5:49:23| Somebody's got to make a motion in that affirmative language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20963)|
| 5:49:27| Anything else has to be a request sent from commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20967)|
| 5:49:30| to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20970)|
| 5:49:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20972)|
| 5:49:34| So I will make the motion so we can clear the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20974)|
| 5:49:38| I will make a motion to make the sector plan LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20978)|
| 5:49:45| A yes vote makes it LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20985)|
| 5:49:46| A no vote keeps it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20986)|
| 5:49:48| Correct, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20988)|
| 5:49:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20990)|
| 5:49:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20991)|
| 5:49:55| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20995)|
| 5:49:56| If you move to approve the sector plan amendment per MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=20996)|
| 5:50:00| that motion has to be seconded and then it has to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21000)|
| 5:50:03| the affirmative vote of a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21003)|
| 5:50:06| If that happens, then the sector plan amendment will be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21006)|
| 5:50:09| and then we'll move to the zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21009)|
| 5:50:11| If you make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21011)|
| 5:50:13| Still not acted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21013)|
| 5:50:14| And for some reason, the vote switches and people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21014)|
| 5:50:18| that motion fails, then we'll have to have another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21018)|
| 5:50:21| You have to pass a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21021)|
| 5:50:23| You have to have a motion, a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21023)|
| 5:50:25| and an affirmative vote of a yes vote from a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21025)|
| 5:50:29| of commission in order to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21029)|
| 5:50:31| And you have to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21031)|
| 5:50:34| That's what he was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21034)|
| 5:50:36| But a no vote, if the commission votes no on your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21036)|
| 5:50:40| that doesn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21040)|
| 5:50:41| You still have to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21041)|
| 5:50:44| You got to win something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21044)|
| 5:50:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21045)|
| 5:50:45| So whatever you want the sector plan to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21045)|
| 5:50:48| Michelle, is the motion you need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21048)|
| 5:50:50| But that would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21050)|
| 5:50:52| She's made that motion and that motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21052)|
| 5:50:55| She can make a second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21055)|
| 5:50:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21057)|
| 5:50:57| So do you make another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21057)|
| 5:51:00| Another motion might be to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21060)|
| 5:51:03| amendment per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21063)|
| 5:51:05| And see where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21065)|
| 5:51:08| And if it fails, it's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21068)|
| 5:51:11| We don't understand what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21071)|
| 5:51:15| If a commissioner makes a motion to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21075)|
| 5:51:19| amendment per MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21079)|
| 5:51:21| that motion receives a second and the affirmative vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21081)|
| 5:51:25| of a majority of commission and the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21085)|
| 5:51:27| will be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21087)|
| 5:51:28| And then we will move to the zoning portion of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21088)|
| 5:51:35| So they want the sector plan left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21095)|
| 5:51:37| Do you have a copy of the file, Jamie, of the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21097)|
| 5:51:41| It's page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21101)|
| 5:51:43| It's page one, what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21103)|
| 5:51:45| Just what the information that was passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21105)|
| 5:51:48| to the Knox County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21108)|
| 5:51:51| See where it says the applicant, applicants request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21111)|
| 5:51:54| and then from, to, and then MPC action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21114)|
| 5:51:57| That's what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21117)|
| 5:52:02| And if you don't have it, I'll be glad to let you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21122)|
| 5:52:04| look at my laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21124)|
| 5:52:07| Just so you guys know what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21127)|
| 5:52:08| because I really appreciate the public hanging in here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21128)|
| 5:52:12| Can I ask a point of order to the, to Daniel or Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21132)|
| 5:52:16| If, if it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21136)|
| 5:52:18| So if, so if you put it up here and it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21138)|
| 5:52:21| then the whole issue's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21141)|
| 5:52:27| If Commissioner Carringer a moment ago made a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21147)|
| 5:52:31| to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21151)|
| 5:52:33| Which was a double negative, because it lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21153)|
| 5:52:35| Well, no, it lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21155)|
| 5:52:37| But the, it's, the courts look at that as the motion failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21157)|
| 5:52:42| When a court looks at the action of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21162)|
| 5:52:44| it needs to see that there was a motion, a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21164)|
| 5:52:49| and that the motion passed with a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21169)|
| 5:52:52| That hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21172)|
| 5:52:54| So we got to go until we get a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21174)|
| 5:52:56| You've got to go until a motion passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21176)|
| 5:52:59| with a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21179)|
| 5:53:01| An affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21181)|
| 5:53:02| I don't know that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21182)|
| 5:53:03| It, it absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21183)|
| 5:53:05| You have to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21185)|
| 5:53:07| Somebody else in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21187)|
| 5:53:08| is kind of squinting at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21188)|
| 5:53:10| I do, can you hear for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21190)|
| 5:53:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21192)|
| 5:53:14| I know what, I know what the state's law said about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21194)|
| 5:53:20| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21200)|
| 5:53:22| I know what the, and, and I know what Daniel's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21202)|
| 5:53:25| And, and he's right on, on this affirmative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21205)|
| 5:53:29| This affirmative action thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21209)|
| 5:53:31| But the bottom line is you've taken affirmative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21211)|
| 5:53:35| and denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21215)|
| 5:53:35| To me, that's an affirmative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21215)|
| 5:53:38| It absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21218)|
| 5:53:39| You have denied the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21219)|
| 5:53:43| You have to do that with a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21223)|
| 5:53:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21226)|
| 5:53:46| And it has to be, if a motion to deny gets a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21226)|
| 5:53:49| and a majority vote, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21229)|
| 5:53:52| But we haven't had that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21232)|
| 5:53:53| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21233)|
| 5:53:54| But if the motion is made to adopt it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21234)|
| 5:53:58| and then commission denies it or comes up and votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21238)|
| 5:54:01| It fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21241)|
| 5:54:02| It fails, and you're back where you started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21242)|
| 5:54:04| And you've taken action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21244)|
| 5:54:06| You have taken a positive action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21246)|
| 5:54:08| You have denied the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21248)|
| 5:54:10| So I think what Daniel, I agree with what Daniel's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21250)|
| 5:54:13| I think we're saying it in two different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21253)|
| 5:54:16| This is basic Roberts rules of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21256)|
| 5:54:20| You have to take action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21260)|
| 5:54:23| It has to be by motion and second and a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21263)|
| 5:54:26| Let's not get wrapped up in whether it's an affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21266)|
| 5:54:29| When I say affirmative, you vote yes for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21269)|
| 5:54:31| And the motion carries by six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21271)|
| 5:54:36| It can be a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21276)|
| 5:54:37| It can be a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21277)|
| 5:54:39| It just has to get six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21279)|
| 5:54:56| We're talking up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21296)|
| 5:55:11| You guys can't have sideboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21311)|
| 5:55:13| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21313)|
| 5:55:14| You can't have sideboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21314)|
| 5:55:15| You can't have sideboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21315)|
| 5:55:16| Let's go up there and ask it from over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21316)|
| 5:55:17| You can't have sideboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21317)|
| 5:55:18| You can't have sideboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21318)|
| 5:55:19| Ask the law director if that motion is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21319)|
| 5:55:25| Can I ask a question to the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21325)|
| 5:55:26| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21326)|
| 5:55:28| Please use the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21328)|
| 5:55:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21329)|
| 5:55:29| OK, so is the, would an example of a motion be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21329)|
| 5:55:36| that the commission approve per MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21336)|
| 5:55:43| to approve sector plan recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21343)|
| 5:55:54| from agriculture to low-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21354)|
| 5:56:02| You either approve the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21362)|
| 5:56:07| deny it, or initiate your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21367)|
| 5:56:09| You have to go per MPC recommendation here or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21369)|
| 5:56:14| Unless you initiate your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21374)|
| 5:56:15| I haven't heard anything about initiating a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21375)|
| 5:56:18| amendment, so you either vote the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21378)|
| 5:56:20| up or down, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21380)|
| 5:56:22| We've had a motion to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21382)|
| 5:56:25| It seems appropriate to me that we have a motion to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21385)|
| 5:56:27| and see where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21387)|
| 5:56:30| You can vote any way you want, but you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21390)|
| 5:56:33| we've got to get six votes to approve a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21393)|
| 5:56:37| Motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21397)|
| 5:56:39| I think that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21399)|
| 5:56:42| Got a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21402)|
| 5:56:43| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21403)|
| 5:56:44| I'm not in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21404)|
| 5:56:47| I'm just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21407)|
| 5:56:47| A second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21407)|
