| 0:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| Let's stand for 30 seconds of silence, or a minute of silence, I guess, and then Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Brown will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| We place the flag and salute and pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=42)|
| 0:00:52| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=58)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| We have essentially four items on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| What happens when a referral goes to the hearing officer from the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| Today, several of us met with TABC, and they will talk about our compliance with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=75)|
| 0:01:23| and then we'll do a little consensus building to try to come to some kind of a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| about when we should defer an action or approve pending, and then there's a revised special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| event application for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| So the first order of business will be Allison and Cindy, and they're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| what happens when a referral goes to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| And I did send you the Whiskey Dicks paperwork, and I think they may talk about that, or they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| may just refer to this sheet with the blue lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| I'm Allison Eberting with the City Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Most of us know each other, and it's good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Cindy Mitchell is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| I thought we might just go through the process with you, and then we're both available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| I did provide you a flow chart today, if you have a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| It pretty much streamlines what we do from the beer board all the way through the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| If you'll first look at the non-ABC flow chart, that's our standard procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| When you all get a case, for example, when you have a situation where a permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| has made two sales to an underage, they're going to come before you at an administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| hearing, and that's under 4-78 of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Cindy Mitchell sends them a notice letter, and then they appear at the hearing before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| you, and then you all are making a decision at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Do you think that there should be more punishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| Is this a time for a warning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Do we defer things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Or do we send them to a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| If you send them to a hearing, the law department takes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| We file a complaint, and we file it with the city recorder's office, just like you file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| a complaint in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| They have their given notice of an appointment of a hearing officer, and then we have a scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| At that point in time, it's very similar to a mini-trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| Sometimes we can agree, and we'll go through that process, and we'll enter an agreed order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| and sometimes we don't agree, and so we'll have an actual hearing where witnesses are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| called, and that's where Tracy Hunter helps us, because her officers are often the witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| And so that's the process that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| One of the things that you'll see, and what Ms. Palmer emailed to you, I guess, a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| days ago, is a sample complaint, and a sample answer, and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| And so it looks very much like a lawsuit at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| The only difference between our process and the ABC process is that the ABC process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| covered under the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| It doesn't give us a whole lot of leniency with regard to the steps that we have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| When we receive a certified letter from the ABC saying that they have suspended or revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| a permit, we are required by law to send it to the next regularly scheduled beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| And you all have seen some of those come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| I think there's been a little bit of discussion about, well, we just saw them last month or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Why is it back before us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| And the reason for that is because of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| And at that point in time, it's very much by rote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| You all have to have a hearing, you have to make a decision, did a violation occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| And if that did happen, there has to be a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| At that point, it's just like the other hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| I file a complaint, we appoint a hearing officer, and we have a trial if they contest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| So far, most of those folks have entered into agreed orders for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It's been a pretty smooth process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Any questions so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Cindy, do you have anything you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| That's in a nutshell what our process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| I hope that if you all have concerns or any confusion about the process, this will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| But we're always available up in the law department if you ever need to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| So we get a, you get a citation, a violation, and we know that it goes to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=316)|
| 0:05:25| Can we delay having our hearing and wait until we get the hearing and then just have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| combine them, or do you automatically just have to hear it when it comes to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| When the certified letter comes to us is when we have to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Sometimes we will have a violation, and it's our second violation, and we, the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| is we're usually ahead of the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| They might be working on their process, and they might have a situation where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| going to hold a hearing, but as, and Ms. Palmer can speak to this too, as we were told today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| by the ABC, it sometimes takes three to six months for them to process their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| So usually we've already sent them the notice letter about the second violation, and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| already come to us for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| We work with them as best we can, and in fact we have worked with them on a couple cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| since this law was passed to try to make things go concurrently, but it's very difficult just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| because of how the timing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| We're required to have that hearing in a certain amount of time upon receiving notice, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| we can't delay it until, to run it concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Ms. Mitchell, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I think Allison answered that perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| It's just that a lot of times, George, we don't even know if the TABC, when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| You know, by the time we get the citation notice and we send our letters out, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| know if they're involved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| One other thing to add, and then I'll call on you, Mr. D'Olivo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| None of this happens overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| We live in an instant world where we think, well, you get the violation, you get the penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| tomorrow, you do whatever it is, and then it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| But this, there has to be X amount of days between each step for people to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| And for me, that's very frustrating, but that's the way the law works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| I was just trying to get it where you're concurrently, and you wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| That is an issue that we talked about today, and TABC does not, and the intent of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| was not that the penalties be served concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| The other side of that coin is, let's suppose that you have a suspension by TABC, so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| can't serve liquor during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| But we haven't acted because we got the information late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So you can still be open and serve beer, so your revenue stream is not totally stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| And then when the beer license is suspended for X days, then you can be serving the liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| So you do have a revenue stream if they're not concurrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| If they're concurrent, then that works differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Another thing that we asked about today, and I think Mr. Frost asked this, sometimes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| will see that somebody's license has been suspended a total of 10 days, but it's three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| days here, three days there, and three days someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| That's because the suspensions now occur only on the days the business is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| And we have some businesses that are only open on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| So if their license is suspended, it will only be suspended on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And so that's why it looks kind of odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I'm going to be sending you one this afternoon later that will look very odd, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Councilman DeLavoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Could you just, you've sort of hit upon it in two or three areas with questions and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| Could you speak again, this microphone's not working, speak again about that, we had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| awkward phase where it seemed like in coordinating with the state that we were almost having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| like double jeopardy for some of these people who were coming in here, and they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| already had a hearing, and it would seem to be almost the same transaction, but we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| that state statute and pilot plan that said we had to coordinate and sort of follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| But it was very awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Some of the people said, I've already been to the hearing, I've already sort of done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| my time, and now we're saying fine, now go to the city hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| I can tell you that it's not double jeopardy in that it's a civil action versus a criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| So for you lawyers out there, I know we all study double jeopardy in law school, but because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| it's a civil action, it isn't legally double jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| I know the attorneys will argue that, but they'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Shaking money out of their pockets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| So that situation can arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| We certainly are communicating with the state, and they know us, so they know to give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| notice if they're about to send us a certified letter, and they've done so in the past six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| months, but I can't swear to you that that's not going to happen again, because what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| do is when we have our second notice for an underage sale, Cindy under 4-78 has to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| them a notice letter to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| And so we may or may not know that the ABC is right about to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| We don't always know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| If we have already had them at a hearing, for an administrative hearing, we've complied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| with our city code, and we have to comply with our city code, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| If they then send us that certified letter, they are going to be coming back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| But I think the response to them is, hey, I've already served my time, I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| been punished for this, is the response is, yes, with regard to your liquor license, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| we're here about your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| And we're here because the state statute requires us to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| And that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| That's how the law is written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| But if we've already worked on their issue as a city problem, when we get the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| and they come back, at that point, can we say we've already taken care of your issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| or must we have yet a second hearing to impose a second fine for the same offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| You're not imposing an administrative fine under our city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| What you're going to have to do, and the state statute is very clear, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| to be voting as to whether or not you think an offense occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| And for all the ABC actions we've seen thus far, they've all been agreed orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| And so that means they've already acknowledged the violation occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| So that really isn't a big debate, but you all have to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| You all have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| And that's what you all vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| For example, the next beer board meeting, you'll have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| You'll have to vote as to whether or not you think that action occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| And if that action, you vote that that action occurred the way the state statute reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| you have to refer them to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I will tell you that City of Knoxville is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Usually, the beer board is acting right at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| They're having the hearing on that situation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| The board itself is sitting as a hearing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| We don't, we haven't drafted our code that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| And so we are, it does take us a little bit longer, but you're going to go to a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| And that's how the statute's written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Obviously, if the state statute gets changed, and it might happen because this pilot project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| ends in the middle of 2014, that might be a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| But right now, under the state statute, we may have that situation come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| If we wanted to, could we, by ordinance, have the right, if we needed to, to dispose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| it before this body, if it's one of these, been there, been here, been there, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| back again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| It just seems, it just seems terribly unfair to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| The state statute says the beer board shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| So I mean, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| I'm saying, but on the local ordinance, if we've already done the activity on the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| penalty, could our ordinance be written so that we can say, you're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| In essence, we have reviewed this and feel that the activity that has already taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| is sufficient to punish you or to encourage you to not violate again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| I think we touched on that a little bit, and Allison can correct me if I misheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| I'm just trying to get refreshed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| The beer board shall schedule a hearing and then go through the steps, but I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| was discussed that the beer board can make a recommendation to the hearing officer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Sort of for time served, so to speak, or penalty paid or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Well, under the way the statute is currently worded, you'd have to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| You're asking, could you change our local ordinance so that you all would then conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| the hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I guess you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| It's certainly something that other beer boards hold the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Now, would it be that same day or would it have to be at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| I'd have to read the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I was wondering if we could have a perfunctory hearing that sort of looked at the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| and said, well, this is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Bless you, my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Sin no more and get out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| You're asking a little bit of a different question in that because you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| An actual hearing with witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Well, you're going to have to have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Now, if they want to present evidence as to whether or not the violation occurred, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| one thing, but they're going to have to, your evidence is going to be that ABC packet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| you get and it's going to have an agreed order in it or it's going to have some type of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| At that point, though, when you talk about we've already given them a punishment, time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| served, the statute has another provision where you all, if you find the violation occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| under our state statute right now, it requires you to take the same punishment at minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| as what the state did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| So let's say that they had a second violation and they went to a hearing under our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| code and we held our hearing, we've got our order, they've already served 10 days of suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| and then two months later, lo and behold, ABC pops up and says, hey, we've taken action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| Under the state statute, the way it is right now, if the ABC board took another 10 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| suspension, we would have to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| So you're going to get punished more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| And as Mr. Bell told us today, the legislature knew that when they were drafting this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| They understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| I mean, they're mean business under this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Sounds like you're going to end up in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| I think that possibly there may be some changes coming our way that would solve some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| But I think for the next six months during the time of the pilot phase of the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| that we're under, we will be maybe facing some of these things again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| The hearing officer has some discretion in how they respond also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| And we have one hearing officer now who's been handling these and she's very consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| and fairly understanding of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Yeah, and I think Allison said that they try to coordinate a little bit closer to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you were there today, so this is our other ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Yeah, well, I mean, I can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| I think it was 99 or 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| I mean, that's how we did that, Nick, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| And then, for whatever reason, it was either 99 or 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| We changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| We used to be, you know, there was some folks at that time thought, well, if we're smart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| enough to give it, we ought to be smart enough to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| And we had full-blown hearings here and we were the deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And I wouldn't say we should do that for every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| I was thinking in these awkward things whether we could have a somewhat summary hearing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| say, bless you, get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| I don't know how you could write it two-sided, but regardless, that's how we used to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| And it seems to work good now as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but we're the only one in the state that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| it this way, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| I'm not aware of any other city that has a veer board that sends it off to a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| I think we are unique in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Mr. Frost, do you have some update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| For those of you that subscribed to the New Sentinel, there was actually an article in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| the paper this week about a very unsightly mess over in Oak Ridge with their veer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| which was their elected legislative body, as well with issues about, I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1045)|
| 0:17:33| law being applied evenly and knowing what they should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| In my personal opinion, the hearing officer has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| It's someone that is above the potential political issues of the situation and tries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| to apply things fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| And uniformly, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Well, and I will add to that, that when we do have full-blown hearings where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| contesting the issues, it is like a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| And we follow the rules of civil procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| And so the hearing officers are all attorneys that practice out in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| And so I can tell you, most of the time, things go very smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| But when they don't go well, it is very nice to have someone who has some experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| Those that will make a record and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I want to ask about the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| We have more than one hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| We have several?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| We have three right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| And how are they selected or appointed, or who does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| By our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| But Rob hasn't had the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| No, actually, they serve one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| And I have no doubt Charles selected folks that are very able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| So we've just kept on keeping on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| The last question I have, as we go through this process, some people come before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| beer board, they have an attorney with them, and some do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| They go through this ABC notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Is there any way that they can have some legal assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Are they on their own for legal assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| There's no legal right to have a free attorney, kind of like what you would have with a criminal trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| I will tell you that Jenna Winfrey at the ABC office in Nashville has dealt with folks who have had attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| and has dealt with folks who haven't had attorneys, just like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Not every person who comes before you and is referred to a hearing has an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| I can tell you that I'm going to tell them the same thing that I would tell their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I'm going to treat them the same way, regardless of whether or not they have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| It's really important to our law department to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| If I have a violation that's just like another case with a similar violation, and they're acting the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| I'm going to really work hard to make sure that the suspension or fine is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| And I tell everybody that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I think the ABC does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| So if somebody calls me and says, should I get an attorney, I'm not going to ever tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| I can't give them legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| But I will tell them that folks do come down here with an attorney, and there are a lot of procedural issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and that sometimes is helpful to have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Well, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| I have the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| I guess it's by each case, but normally on this ABC notice type, what's roughly the time frame on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1215)|
| 0:20:24| As far as when we will get notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| It was getting all the way down from scheduling the conference occurs and the hearing schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| When you get to the end of it, let me put it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| When we get the certified letter at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| as long as it's more than 14 days, that's when they're going to come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| Once you all send it to a hearing, I have a timeline when I have to file a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| And then under our city code, we have a pretty strict timeline to have the first initial hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| And that's the preliminary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| At that hearing, the hearing officer, just like a judge would do in a trial, will have a scheduling order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| And she'll talk to us about, is the issue going to be contested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Will there be the need to depose witnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| How long will you take in discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Depending on how things work, we might have an ultimate hearing set a month from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| It might be a couple months from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| So there's not a fixed amount of time once we get into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| It just really depends on the facts of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Is the only violation we deal with is either serving to underage or selling or serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Is that the only violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It's not the only violation that I deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| But 4-78 is the only violation, and that's the sales to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| that come before you on an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| I don't know how many of you all are familiar with the Michaels case that happened years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| That wasn't just underage violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| There were some, but there were also over-serving violations and there was some disorderly conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| In certain situations, in certain cases, if KPD is having a problem with an establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| and it's not an underage sale issue, there are times when we will file a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| and we have the authority to do so under the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| And it's the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| It just doesn't come to the beer board for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| The only administrative hearings we have are under 4-78, and that deals with underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Okay. Any other questions on this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Okay. The TAVC, City of Knoxville Beer Board Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| I think we kind of lumped all these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Do you want to add anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| I don't. I hope that it's been helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| And feel free to call if you ever have any questions about why a particular case is working one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| We really do try to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| But I can understand, especially this summer when we were first starting to see these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| why there was some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Of course, there's always one way that we won't have any of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| and that's if everyone is in compliance when they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| And sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you very much, and thank you for going this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Sergeant Hunter, you're involved with the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Do you have anything to add, or are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I think you all covered it fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I will say that ABC was very complimentary of Sergeant Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| and the working relationship between the two bodies in enforcing particularly underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| and overselling and some other kinds of issues that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| The next item on the agenda is one that we have dealt with at the beer board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and that is when to approve pending final documentation and when to defer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| And I did send all of you kind of a worksheet to give this some serious thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| What I tried to do was identify the most common situations when we have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| And so the first one is have they paid the publication fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| Is everybody fine with, you know, approved pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Typically, Ms. Day, you won't send this to us if they haven't paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Yes, ma'am, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| So that's kind of a moot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Maybe you folks can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Let's say I want to get a beer license, and so I come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| How much education do you give me in terms of going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| and knowing that I have to do this, this, this, and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| and I have to see the building officials and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| so that I know whether or not I want to even apply at that particular time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| In other words, I might be building an establishment that I don't plan to open until July 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| So would I come to you, and you would tell me a process I'd go through and say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| well, you may not want to get your license until June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| In other words, how do we prep an applicant before they end up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| where we have to say pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Well, it kind of just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| If they're smaller businesses and they kind of know they're going to go in immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| if we have a former owner sitting there too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| sometimes the sale of the business is contingent upon this new owner being able to obtain a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| So that can kind of slow down things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| They'll get the beer permit maybe a couple of months in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Generally, we go over it with them piece by piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| We do tell them that they do have to call the inspectors, get the inspectors out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Of course, we give them that second page of the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| If you copy it off of the website, it's the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| All the little check marks have to be checked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| It has everybody's phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| We go over that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| But we have very few that, you know, get scared with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| They're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Well, in your experience, having done this for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| are there extenuating circumstances, are there certain circumstances that continue to crop up that we may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| well, yeah, those ought to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Oh, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| You mean like records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| You mean like records checks or things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| I mean, is there something that keeps coming up that you've seen over the period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| The main problem is calling the inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| They forget to do that because, like the fire department and the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| they may come out and okay the building but not for the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| I really myself don't know what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| But they have to call, make an appointment with the inspectors, and that's been our biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| We try to get them to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| We give it to them when they come in to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| If they mail the application in, we send that page to them that tells them they have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| And then a few days before or a week before the beer board meeting, I send them a reminder letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| And if I don't have those checked off in their file, I check them off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| You need to call your inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| But that, I think, is the number one thing, inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| If I could interject on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| I've seen a few come through that the lease or the sales contract is contingent upon getting a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| And that would, you know, if they get that early enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| then they've got to do their tenant improvements or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And then that could delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| And it could delay it for six months if you had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| So we've seen a couple of those that I know of personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Well, let's go on down the list a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| The Knox County, the current city business license and the Knox County business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| they have those by the time they get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Yes, ma'am, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Here's where we get to the inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| The certificate of zoning, that one is always in place because it is either zoned for what they want to do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| If they want to appeal and get a different zoning, then they need to go to a different body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| The building inspector approval, again, it's a matter of them calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| And right now the building department is not so overwhelmed with construction permits citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| that they can't get to these fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| But if you call them on Monday before your hearing on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| there's a really good chance they won't be there to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| The same for the fire prevention and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I think the rub with this body has been on the task program certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Sergeant Hunter, do you want to review for us one more time when the classes are offered and what the process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| The classes are offered every Thursday except for Thanksgiving and Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| The classes are mandated by the state to run five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| They run nine to three when they call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| We have an actual dedicated phone line that they can call and get an automated message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| that tells them everything that we would tell them over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| But they frequently call our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We tell them you have to show up to class about 30 minutes early because we only have space for 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| So it's first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| And some days we do have to send people home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| They have to bring government-issued photo ID to sit for the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| because we check everybody's identity before they go through it, $50 cash check or money order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| And then we go over the registration process with them when we bring them downstairs to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| That's pretty much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| When is the records check initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| When we're doing the task class, we'll go over the sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| We'll look at the sign-in sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| And after they've filled out their registration paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| we'll ask them how many people in the class need to undergo a background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| and get fingerprinted because they're either a new manager that's been added on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| or they've newly applied for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| And then what we'll do is we'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| We'll find out the names of the people who raised their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| We'll check to see that they are in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| And if they aren't, then we tell them they have to file the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| and pay the fee to WANDA before we can do the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| If they have already done that and they're good to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| then we do that for the people in the class that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| How frequently do you have more than 30 people show up for a class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Usually we'll have a full class right after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| the two weeks after Mary sends out the letters that people are not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| And she does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| She keeps up with that monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| So I think the letters go out probably every other month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Mike, this is the one that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Where do you actually conduct the classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Where are they held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| They're held at the safety building in the training room in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| This is the one that has caused the most controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| and sometimes is an uncomfortable situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| when one person will come through and they don't have the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| and then the next person comes through and they do have the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| So in the interest of some consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| we need to see if we can come to some kind of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| We may not all be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We may all love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| But we need to be giving some serious thought to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Mr. Frost, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| I was just going to say, if you're going to have a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| it needs to be applied equally to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| I mean, you know, you might, for example, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| the Capitol Grill is coming to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| and they have some things that you haven't – they haven't checked the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| And you pass them subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| and then the next folks up, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| it's George and Stephanie's Rock and Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| And they haven't done many of the similar same things, yet they get deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| If not outright, turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| But from a legal perspective, from just, I guess, a fundamental fairness perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| you've got to treat folks the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| Okay, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Well, I'm in favor of that that's the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| that they have to attend the class and have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| And then that takes away any type of subjective answer authority that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| I mean, we can – then that's out of – it's out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| We've seen the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| We've seen the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| And there's no – I mean, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| And then the rest of the stuff is just a matter of whether they get the forms filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| So your suggestion is that if they have not completed the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| or they don't have the records check, that we would defer it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Councilman de la Vogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| We're not taking motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| I was just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Then we're going to remember at the next meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| I mean, looking at this checklist that you have, the first four items are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| it seems to me they're preconditioned before they ever get on the agenda, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| I don't – I think they should have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| They're in their control to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| I don't know why they wouldn't have done those first four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| On the three or four inspections, if they've requested it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and it hasn't yet happened, it's somewhat out of their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And I feel like, you know, we could give them some leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| To get to George's point, the two main things that might bar them are do they have the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and do they have the record background that allows them to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| I mean, that's pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| So it sounds like if you're going to be consistent, you ought to be deferring rather than winking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| or pending something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| We ought to just say, sorry, you didn't do it, come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| It's not our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| It's yours kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Because you may find out things on their record that you may –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| we may decide as a board to say that's fine or it's not fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| But that's really not up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| If their record is not in compliance, they would not – whether we acted or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| they would not get the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Ms. Day is very good about not letting a license go out without everything dotted, eyed, and crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| But those are the real substantive things George is saying, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Things that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| That is something we talk about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| We go back and say, well, wait a minute, what's the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| We discuss that and I think we've delayed or deferred or sent some people out based on their record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| So it is a little bit – I see it as a little bit subjective when you're talking about those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| The awkward one to me is when we have two owners and one did the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| and the other was out of town and he's going to do it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| I don't know what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| We haven't been real consistent about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Well, I guess I'll start with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Is there any – do we have any discretion on the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Aren't there some crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I guess because my opinion is and frustration sort of just sitting on this board is that we really don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| with giving out these permits, we really don't have any discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Actually, there are some places where I think a committee, not the locally elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| sitting as the beer board grant the beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I think – or that might be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I think it might be allowed under the state law actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| But generally speaking, you have the crimes of moral turpitude as a basis for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| A lot of the times people get crossways because they have failed to disclose something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| They're not being truthful on their application, and that's how they can get denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Or in some circumstances, we've had some managers lately who failed to disclose a litany of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| and they've gotten deferred for 30 days where they can find a manager that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| So as your answer to the question, do we do have some discretion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| The state legislature and I guess the alcohol lobby has taken away a lot of the discretion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| Because my feeling is that since we don't really have any discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| I just see at some point there's going to be some story by some applicant that we're going to want to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| pending final documentation and break this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| If we do adopt this thing, well, why don't we just approve them all pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| and they've still got to check the boxes to get the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| For all we know, they could sleep through the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I don't know, but we still approve it whether they do it before or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| So to me, in terms of wanting to be business friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| and sort of get through this red tape to get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| I think I'm in favor of approving them all pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| because we really don't have any discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| You know, we sit up here and we have microphones and turn on lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| but at the end of the day we have to approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| And if they don't check the boxes, they don't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| I'll get to you in just a second, Vice Mayor Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| I agree with Councilman Steyer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, we really don't have the discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| I mean, Rob, I think your answer was the moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| I mean, we don't have discretion in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Either they are or they aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Our actual city ordinance says basically if you check all the boxes, you shall get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| So, I mean, I guess my question would be to Wanda is have we ever, in your knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| you've been doing this how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Given a permit out inadvertently without all the boxes being checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| And, I mean, I think that would be the consistent answer all the way across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| And you're trying to get people who are opening businesses that are, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| one manager has been in, one hasn't been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| You know, being in the restaurant business as long as I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| and seeing the actual stages right before the restaurants and what have you are open are chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| And very chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| And, you know, not always, but for the most part they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| And I just, you know, I don't think it, I don't know really what the purpose is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| I understand, oh, you're not being, you're not doing your diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| and you're going to sell to young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| I don't see that correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| And I think that we should be, as Councilman Starr said, you know, as business friendly as we can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| and keep the process moving along and let them get open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| You know, they're hiring people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| They're bringing in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| They're paying property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| So, you know, unless it became a problem, I would be in favor, as I always have been, of going ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| The bottom line is that that permit is not going out the door until they have completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| So if they go to the next one after the beer board meeting, then they will have satisfied the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| but they won't have to wait four weeks, or in some cases five weeks, to get their permit to be operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| The same thing for the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| If the record comes back and shows that there are some things that are out of line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| then they won't get the license either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| I see Mr. Swanson's in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And when he was the predecessor to Mr. Frost, I think five of us were beaten so severely so often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2372)|
| 0:39:40| about the limits of the power of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| And I remember one discussion that someone came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| They had a pretty hefty property tax bill that they owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| And there were some people on the beer board who wanted to hold that license until they paid those property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| I've seen some people come with some speeding tickets that dated back several years, several thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| And I just really want to say, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| If you can't be responsible to do that, how could you be responsible for the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| But then Mr. Swanson's standing back behind me, beating me, saying, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| So those of you who are newer to the beer board missed that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| But he did take fairly well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Double dog dare him and let's pay the bill and meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| I'm going to go to Councilman Greave, then to Mayor Brown, and then to Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| I think maybe, Ms. Palmer, maybe you deserved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Oh, I shouldn't have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| I just got the Palmer look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| I understand what both of you are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| And I kind of have mixed feelings about it because I do wonder what kind of power we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| But on the other hand, I think that, you know, I sort of equate it like getting a driver's license or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| You know, you have to be prepared and you have to go and you have to take the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| And, you know, if you go and get your driver's license and don't pass the test, you don't get your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| And I think that, to me, if somebody is going to open a business, and we do want to be business friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| but if somebody wants to open a business, they need to have a checklist of things they need to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| And if this is important to them, which it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| it also I think it sends a message for what we think is important as a board and as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| And I think that we want to continue to send that message that, hey, you know, we're serious about your beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| And that I think that if this is one way in which we can do that, I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| But, you know, it's kind of complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| But I think that we should come to some kind of consensus that we're either going to accept it or we're not going to accept it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| so that we don't get into this situation where Dwayne Greve gets a beer license and George Wallace doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| So if we can come to some kind of consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| But I think it's pretty serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| I mean, when I think about, you know, trying to open a business and, Nick, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| I mean, you know, we've worked with restaurants and we know what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| But it also says to me, well, what's important here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| You know, in terms of if you want that license and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| and we're clear in terms of what's expected, then I think it should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| And I'm really sorry to interrupt because this clearly is a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| But lawyers, we usually have to look at worst case scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| And I want to bring up a situation that has come up in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| When the records check is done, you obviously have seen those before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| And so they'll have a list of crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| And while you all don't have a lot of discretion, sometimes the issue about moral turpitude is a little bit fuzzy and gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| For example, if somebody is charged with an exhibitionist-type crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| where they're running across Nalin Field naked, that's clearly a criminal offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| But it's not so clear if that's moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| And so I want you all to understand, like, you all are the ones that make the decision of whether or not it's a crime of moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2592)|
| 0:43:22| If you don't see that records check before you grant the permit, WANDA can't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| And so that concerns me just a little bit about not getting the records check before you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| And I understand the point about being business friendly, but the records check doesn't take very long to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And it's something totally within their control to apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| So they're not waiting on anybody at the city to apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| So please keep that in mind because if WANDA then gets the records check back and there's a questionable charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| and we've had that come up before it comes to you about is this something of crime of moral turpitude or not, we don't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| You all have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| I agree that we need to be consistent so we be fair to everyone that comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| But, Mr. Frost, I think you said that there are some municipalities where there's a committee other than the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| I thought about that more, but I think it is allowed under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| I think I've researched that issue before where you can appoint someone to make those decisions to grant the beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2665)|
| 0:44:37| Well, I'm just curious how long, you may know, you may not know, has the city council served as the beer board here in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2677)|
| 0:44:47| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| As long as I can ever remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| So about five years then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| That's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| But, Nick, you were really close on the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| It was 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I'll have to research that and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Let me say something real quick also about moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I've got something here that I've spoken about with Allison and Ron Mills and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| because on occasion we'll have something come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| This is six pages of different crimes that are about moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| If you recall, we had someone falsely claim their girlfriend was getting raped in a restaurant on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2721)|
| 0:45:29| because the guy was mad and had gotten thrown out, and obviously that was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| So it's different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| It's fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| It's evil intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| So, you know, you get these, you know, Tracy runs records check, and you'll see these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| and a little investigation needs to be done on some of these crimes that have been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| Most often I've observed over the time I've been on the beer board that people will check that they have no record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| but then as the record comes back, perhaps they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| And so this has been probably where we've denied most licenses is because they did not carefully read the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| and answer the questions carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| You made all my points right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| I mean, I think Allison said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| It's not every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| But we had a situation over here where we named names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| It came across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| It came across the street, and we had the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And we said as a group, there's no way we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| We didn't agree with the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| We didn't, there was other factors that we considered outside, and we denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Criminal, the waif opens the second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Yeah, and so I think to take, you know, it's, I'll just go back to Duane and what Allison said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| and what you just said, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| I think that's one thing you got to look at, and we got a little bit of judgment on, and it's not total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| I would give up on the task class before I gave up on the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| But it's okay, it's okay to have guidelines and application and follow process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| That does not mean you're un-business friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| That's just the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Do the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| If you're serious about it, getting a beer permit and opening up your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| these are things you got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| It's not that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| One of the things that we. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| I don't want to be unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| I don't want to be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| But I think you definitely want to apply it in a consistent manner, and I think we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| One of the things that we could do, and when they come to get the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| and with the paperwork that goes with it, is to really stress and emphasize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| you better have that records check before your date, your first date comes up for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And then if they choose to not do that, that's their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| But, I mean, that would be one way to really stress. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Everything on here needs to be done, but there are some things that need to be done sooner than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| and that records check is one of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| And get the task class out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| And then, you know, right now if you get the application and you look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| and where those items come on the checklist are not as high as they are, as they might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| And maybe it's just a matter of reordering those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Councilman DelaVolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Well, I've heard two viewpoints now, and I'm still wrestling with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| but I think I know where I come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| One is that it's a drive-through window, and if you check all the boxes, you get the permit and off you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| And the other is, well, in addition to having formal steps, there is this, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2913)|
| 0:48:42| sense that's instilled on them that it's an important obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| and even though it may be somewhat rote in terms of checking the blocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| that it's going to be taken serious and you better mine the store when you leave with the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| And I think that second view is probably worth sticking with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| I think that they ought to know that we're serious about the sales to miners and those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| and that they have to have procedures in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| and maybe we should even remind them as we give them the permit or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| That's the one deterrent is just that they just don't casually put in a bunch of baloney on a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| and get a permit and go off and do the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Councilman Grieben and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Well, I was going to say, and Nick had said earlier, if you look down the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| there are two things that are absolutely the responsibility of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| and that's the task program and the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| And the corporate charter has gotten them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| I'm not sure how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| The applicant provides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| So really, when you look down the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| there's two or three things that are really the responsibility of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| and it seems to me that they ought to do that on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| I think that I've heard a compromise here in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| we might be willing to accept the task not being completed at the time that they're before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| but the records check, background check, you know, based on what Allison said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| I mean, I heard two different deals, but she's, you know, she's in the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| and we're on record, and I don't want to go against what she said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| because we could have problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| But, I mean, I think that would be probably a pretty good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| if we're looking for a compromise here to accept it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| If they don't have the background check, it's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| And if they have everything but the task or, you know, some of the, then it would be a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| We could do a straw poll and really drive Marshall crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| I think a straw poll is just a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Do you want to word that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Well, you know, I thought I just did, but let me think about it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Mr. Frost, you might want to help me, but let me take a stab at it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| I mean, I think it's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| We've got the boxes that need to be checked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| The one that we would not collectively approve is if the background check was not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| And then I heard that, you know, I think that there could probably be some wiggle room there on the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| And those are the things, really, that we can affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| How's the comfort level on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Everybody comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| Something is not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Well, with the understanding that if you don't come in with a certificate from the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| when you get to the office, they don't hand you the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| You've got to turn in something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| But the records check is where they – that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| So everybody's comfort level is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Then if they have not done the records check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| we would defer until the next meeting so that they could get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| And the task class, Wanda will do a body block to prevent them leaving the office with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| So we're good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| I have just a slight question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Should we be advising them from this panel that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| you've got a manager with a blacklist in terms of conduct, activity, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| go get a different manager and resubmit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| I mean, maybe that's business friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| but I don't know whether we should be advising them or just denying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Well, we tell them that that manager is not eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| and so if we are business friendly, we would give them 30 days to find a new manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| and someone that we recently made that suggestion has done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| And most of the cases that have come before us, they have taken care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| What surprised me in that instance, and I think several others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| is that the business had not done a background check on somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| who would be an integral part of their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| and particularly since this was a national chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| So that has become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Can we move on to the last item on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| No, we just all were comfortable, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Everybody nodded and smiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I took that as a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| They were a bit of a stain, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Where's John King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Remember, he still has 15 minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| The last item on the agenda, and then we'll have public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| is the revised special event application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| And I think that you each have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| It should be probably the very last two pages of the stack of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| that Ms. Wilson so graciously prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| And what this is removes a lot of items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| because special event beer permit applications do not have to go through all the hoops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| that others have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| But in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| this makes it very clear that they have to have a copy of the designation letter from the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| that they are, in fact, a 501C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| or that they are a political organization defined in Tennessee code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| What is a political organization defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| It could be a PAC, it could be a candidate, or it could be a political party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| But they would have to have that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| or they would have to have a letter that tells them that they meet that qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Just a reminder that no one can have two permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| one for their business normally and then a special event permit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| You can only have one permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| And what this particular application does in the revised form is to make it pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| that you have to be one of these two things or you're not going to get a special event permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| And what my proposal is that if everybody's okay with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| that we will send these out with all of the applicants from the past two years for special event permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| so that they see that the application has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| and that they also have a list of the beer board meeting dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| with the understanding that they need to have their stuff in by the first of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| that we're not going to have a special meeting because they forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| And that they know that there have been some changes, that we are friendly, we want to be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| Most of them have done a really good job, but this kind of eases some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| The first part of the first page is right out of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| and so it's not something that I dreamed up late one night when I couldn't sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| You're talking about the A through E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| You're talking about the situation we had where the person wanted to do something in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| but they were not allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| They had to stay physically on the grounds of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| They had issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| What they were seeking was outside the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| Allison, do you recall the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| I think most of the time it's the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| If it's not within the CBID, you can't do that, and I think that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| The other one, I don't think they actually had a special event permit at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| They had a beer permit for their establishment, and they had gone to special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| but they didn't have a special event permit from you all, and that was the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| And there's a difference between a special event beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| and a special event permit from the special events office, and we will be coordinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| I'll be working to coordinate with them more closely so that we don't have a he said, she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| Well, they said in special events I could close the street and sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| and then special events didn't say that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| So this will eliminate some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| but we will be working very closely with special events office to see that we don't get into that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| Who came up with the idea that you can only do this twice a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| That was in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| It's been in the code forever, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| People that get a permit for the whole year and they have like five different events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Chilhowee Park and the zoo is in Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| and so they can do more than two special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| but I think the zoo is going to apply for a regular beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| That is a different part of the code, but this is groups like, well, we'll take the Rossini Festival, the opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| They could get two special event beer permits over the course of a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| and most organizations, if they're going to do more than two special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| they'll just go ahead and get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| We had the arts group down on the 100 block of Gay Street did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| They just got tired of dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| INES came in and got a beer permit because they wanted to do more than two events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| but this is for people like the Dogwood Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Second Harvest, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| So that they really only want to deal with beer twice a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| and so this basically kind of sets things out very clearly for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| so that they know what they have to do and what they don't have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| And it's only for selling the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| In other words, if I want to have a block party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| I don't have to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| No, you can't have a block party because you can't close your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Well, I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| You could, and then Sergeant Hunter might come calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Special detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| I mean, I'm sure that there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| but legally streets cannot be closed and beer can't be consumed on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| other than some special zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Am I right, Ms. Evertine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Well, there was that one issue that got brought to your attention, Rob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| about I think it was in East Knoxville they wanted to have Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| I think, wanted to have an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| And as long as they stayed on their property of one residence or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| and didn't take it off the property, it was okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| And they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| I don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| I have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| I would guess that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| knowing people in Park Ridge that probably got together and they served free beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| As far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| They would not need a permit for that, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| We're not out there policing what you do if you're having a party at your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| and the party's outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| But when you start talking about closing up, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| But when you start consuming beer out in the street, that's technically a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| So, Mr. Grebe, I would like to not know that you're having a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| I'll be sure to invite you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| And just remember that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| It's going to be Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| I'm not able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| People who walk out in the street on Cumberland with a cup of beer do get cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| And so that's no different than walking on Kingston Pike with a bottle of beer or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3616)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| So is everybody – yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Well, then let's have your separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| I just wanted to bring this up at this time since we're talking about the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| and it's about the termination issue when someone comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| And I think there's some members that feel frustrated when an employer comes up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| that's terminated the employee that sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| And sometimes it's almost like they want to punish the employer who's terminated the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| And I understand that because a lot of times it seems like that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| they feel like if they just terminate the employee that that's going to satisfy us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| But being an employment lawyer, I mean, it's – I mean, the most conservative advice you'd give to an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| that had an employee would be to terminate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| So you could be giving them advice that really contradicts what their attorney might tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| because, I mean, if you think about it, I mean, they run a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| and their employee broke the law while they were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| So – and it's a serious law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And they put their business at risk, serious liability, hundreds, millions of dollars at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| To terminate that employee is a pretty logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| And if you think about it, you know, if you think about other things that are taken serious in the workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| sexual harassment or violence, you know, if you take it seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| you would terminate that employee that, you know, committed sexual harassment in a serious way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| or committed violence, you wouldn't say, oh, it's time to go have training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| And then also you have to think about just the liability moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| because then if you keep that employee, you now know that they have sold to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| So if they do it again, there's a history, and then that increases your potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| I don't know if the other lawyers in the room want to chime in, but it's just something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| I think, of course, everybody on the board is entitled to their own opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| and is certainly at liberty to say, but just sitting in my chair when I hear that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| I kind of seize up and think, no, this could be an employer that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| doing everything he can to protect his or her business and taking this as serious as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| and wants to make an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| It's how do you, as an employer, how do you say this is the most serious offense you can is to terminate them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| And so the other employees know, you know, if I care about this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| I better not serve underage or I'm going to get terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| I mean, to me, there's a real deterrent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| So I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| I've never felt comfortable saying it while in the midst of a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| because I understood where people are coming from when they bring that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| but I just wanted to bring that up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| And I think this is an advantage to having an attorney with a specialty as yours on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| Now, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Yeah, well, you know, you're wiring up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| But, you know, it's just here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| The reality of it is is that person can walk probably 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| and get the same job as a server or a waitress or waiter or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| I mean, again, being in the restaurant business as long as I was, I mean, that's what happens to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| And so they take that same record and the same bad record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and then they can go right down there and do the same thing again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| they know if that employer knows the record, as you say, but train them, work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| You know, I say it more than anybody, and probably the only one that's ever said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| but work with them and train them to not do that and teach them not to do it rather than fire them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| and then they just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| I'm just telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| I mean, you see the same people, you know, that make a living doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| They can get a job practically every day because, you know, there's high turnover in the restaurant business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| So, you know, number one, I'm not giving them advice, and I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| I mean, they can take it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3891)|

| 1:05:07| I mean, that's, you know, that was just my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| I don't see any punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3910)|

| 1:05:24| We'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| I still say it, but we'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877131121?start=3925)|
