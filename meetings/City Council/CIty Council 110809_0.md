| 0:01:53| Any items for a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Any items requested to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Good day, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| There's a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Item 12A, I would like to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| that we postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| We're working on some components of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| and I think 60 days will come out with a better result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| So I'd like to postpone this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Postpone this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| It's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=146)|

| 0:02:36| Any consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| Councilwoman Palmer, is that your old light or your new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=166)|
| 0:02:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Under the Mayor's report, I have a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| Under heading of CAD, it's hard to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| that the Transportation Center has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| open for almost one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| So please plan to stop by the John J. Duncan Jr. Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| Station Transit Center open house between 2 and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| There will be cake, activities for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| tours, and displays of grand opening activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Also, after a lengthy public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| CAD will begin its new trolley routes on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| August the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Of particular note is the addition of a gay street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| line that will go from Magnolia and Filth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| on the north to Hill Avenue and to the Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| This line will operate until 6.30 PM from Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| to Thursdays and until 10 PM on Fridays and Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| The Vow line connecting the UT area to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| will likewise operate until 10 PM on Fridays and Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| With the opening of school comes the opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| of a brand new school right in the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| So please join us for the ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| at the LNN for the new Knox County STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| And that's going to be at 10 AM Friday, August the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| on the world's first site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| And finally, I want to congratulate the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Chamber on being named as the National Chamber of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| And we'll be having an event on Wednesday at 4 PM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| in front of their offices on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| to recognize their good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Are there any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| I'd just like to highlight the ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| or the grand opening today of the Urban Wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Trail in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Just can't convey how excited and proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| I am for it to be in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| But for those that maybe are not familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| it's a 15-mile continuous, I call it a hike and a bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| trail, that is really going to be a crown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| jewel not only for this city, but for this whole region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Because there's just not a lot of places in this United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| that you can go to have continuous hike or bike trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| and it's just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| But I would also like to pay special thanks to Victor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| and Joan Ashe, who contributed heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| to this in the amount of $40,000 to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| along with the help of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| And I thank my colleagues once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| for including it in the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| this year to be able to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| But it was really a collaborative effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| by a lot of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| The Appalachian Back Trail folks have been instrumental in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| And I've said this earlier today while addressing the crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| that I can remember back in the first week of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| And it was cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| It was spitting snow and raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| And there was 50 people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| with picks and axes and shovels and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| smiling and really having a good time creating these trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| And I knew then it was going to really be something special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| So it's something for South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| in itself to rally around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| I mean, obviously, the business community there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| are feeling the effects of a major bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| But they got their chins up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| And they're really excited about what this is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| It's going to brand South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| It's going to put us on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| It's going to give folks another good reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| to come visit South Knoxville and spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| their time and their money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| And you don't have to go up 40 or 50 miles in any direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| to find what you can find right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Now it's in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| So I urge everyone to begin at IM's and here before too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Hopefully, it'll be totally marked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| where you can follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| But it's just a real grand event today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| And I'm excited that it took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| and just look forward to adding on to this trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| as time goes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| All right, thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| I just thought I might mention for the folks at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| that the Pension Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| is going to be meeting again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I believe it's on August the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| That's Thursday at 4 PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| The important point is they're moving their location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| to have more room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| And they'll be at the KCDC public meeting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| or board room, which is, I guess, off Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| So that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=471)|

| 0:08:48| to approve a use on review for a master sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| plan in PC 101 and RP 1 districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| subject to conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Property located on the south side of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| at Moss Grove Boulevard, south of Marketplace Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| in conjunction with Resolution 11-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| which is a resolution approving the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Yes, can we go ahead and approve this or discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| when we get to 11-0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=559)|
| 0:09:19| You mean consolidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I think he wants to consolidate 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| You consider 11-0 together with the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| What can we do when we get, can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| go ahead through the rest of the agenda and get to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| No, we are at this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| No, we're at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| We're actually there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=577)|
| 0:09:48| Are you making a motion on that, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| I'm going to have to amend the agenda to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| I guess I have to ask Mr. Swan, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| a little confused as to how this is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| in terms of being 10-A and then 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Could you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Well, 10-A is the appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| And this is 11-0 is simply a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| that approves the appeal should you adopt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| They are companion pieces that go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Your only way to act is by resolution in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Your only way to act at all is by resolution or by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| In this particular case, your only method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| to act is by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| And 11-0 is simply the companion ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| that accompanies the appeal that gives you a vehicle for acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| Yes, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| I think probably the appropriate thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| to do under the circumstances is to hear first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| from the appellants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Three speakers for the appellants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| is what our rules allow for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Three speakers from the persons who oppose the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| And then make your motion after that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| It is typically the way we have handled appeals in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| And it seems to work out very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=684)|
| 0:11:24| We'll go ahead and hear from those persons who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| have signed up to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| And first person we have listed is Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| If you, is Ms. Klein here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| She's on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Well, we'll go down to the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| It's Joyce Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Is Ms. Joyce Fell here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Todd Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Come down and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Mayor Brown, Councilman, and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| My name is Todd Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I live at 717 Elkmont Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| I own two businesses in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| And I'm a presiding president of the Cedar Bluff Area Residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| The surrounding neighborhoods look forward to the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| opening soon at the Cheryl Hill property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| because many of the neighborhoods or neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| will be applying for positions in those stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| It'll be a great boost to our local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| and to have them so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| However, they're not making a very good first impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| with what could be their closest and strongest customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| namely the residents of the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| The developer has proposed and his initial approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| for a 50-foot development sign as part of the master signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| This height far exceeds the need for signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| and well-established area norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| It is our contention that the developer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| submittal to the MPC was flawed in several aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| But most importantly, it did not meet the MPC requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| of a master signage plan, which states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| a master signage plan will promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| the use of signs which are aesthetically pleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| of appropriate scale, and integrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| with the surrounding buildings and landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| in order to meet the community's expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| desire for quality development consistent with the property's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| The application package must include the master signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| plan application and a consent form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| signed by all the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| for a unified development under consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| scale drawing showing the dimensions, the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| details for all the proposed signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| including sign illumination and landscaping plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| a computation for the maximum total signed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| the maximum area for individual signs, the height of the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| and the number of freestanding signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| allowed on the lots included in the unified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| keyword there unified, development under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| This was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| The MPC approved the sign because it's a 50-foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| is possible, but did not consider its location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| on top of a 12-foot berm, and the key wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| signs which are aesthetically pleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| and appropriate scale, and integrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| with the surrounding buildings and landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| in order to meet the community's expressed desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| for a quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| It's my understanding they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| want to determine what was appropriate scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| and what was aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| To the property owners in the Cheryl Hill development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Aldi and Gordon Food Services have already received approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| for their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| To our knowledge, these two property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| have not signed on to the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| It appears these two properties cannot be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| in the unified development under the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| and this master sign plan must be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| We ask that you vote yes to our appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| and no to their plan as it stands today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Numerous area citizens and the leadership of nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| neighborhoods are joining forces with various community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=883)|

| 0:15:09| Up till now, growth and development in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| have been done in general harmony with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=912)|

| 0:15:26| NPC requirements for the community-expressed desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| for quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| To give you some perspective on how the proposed 50-foot signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| does not meet the established norms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=934)|

| 0:15:40| across from Cheryl Hill, recognized these norms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| and the character of the area, and therefore requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| and were recently granted their development signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| with no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| In February 2010, Kroger proposed a brick development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| directory structure that is 30 feet tall at its peak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| of the roof and approximately 27 feet tall at the sign face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| The secondary monument signage also is 8 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| These signs will serve as multi-tenant commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| development that has 24 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| The Cheryl Hill master plan does not meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| set by the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| The commercial area of Cheryl Hill is approximately 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| similar to the Kroger multi-tenant shopping area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Cheryl Hill's attorney stated to the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| that development signage would only have three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| retailer panels on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| also similar to the Kroger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| We ask you deny the sign plan in favor of the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| not to exceed 25 feet from street level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| consistent with the other existing signs in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| as well as a recently approved Kroger sign across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| We ask that monument signs at the Cheryl Hill property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| not exceed 10 feet, which is the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| that has already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Mr. Olsen, I'm going to have to ask you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| I think you've reached your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| I practiced it, I got it in, but not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Bottom line is it doesn't meet the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| the way it's written today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Let me go back and see if Ms. Kline is here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| I saw someone come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Okay, if you could give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| My name is Margaret Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| My address is 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| And I'm also here today to ask you to please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| vote yes to our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| And because I think that we have expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| what we think about the NPC's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| being somewhat faulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| rather than go over the same information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| I thought I would show you some images of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| and just try to explain why this particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| of Knox County deserves a little bit of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| And I know that on your screens in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I think you're able to see this picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| a little bit better than what's on the overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| I apologize to anyone here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I did come over earlier and try to get this set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| so that it would be visible, but it isn't very easy to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| But I'll try to say what's on the screen if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| The picture that's up there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| shows basically Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| in front of the Cheryl Hill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| And this development was on a very, very large piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| of land that had been in a family for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| And like about three other large tracts out in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| it is just now being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| The Kroger's, as was just expressed to you by Todd Olson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| is being developed, Caddy Corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| It's directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| and down about half a block toward town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I guess because these areas have not been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| there isn't a great deal of signage out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| It's actually one of the more pristine areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| It's one of the prettier areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| And it is annexed to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| so it's yours to take care of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| And we are asking you, as folks who live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| to be conscious of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| that this particular section of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| was developed in the late 1790s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| by the same founders as downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Along with the day you're out in the Fountain City area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| this is one of the oldest areas in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| Cedar Springs Church was founded in 1794, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1175)|
| 0:19:44| I could go into that, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Let me just go ahead and say, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| that now that this area's being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| we would ask you to use the best practices and not the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| There's some very ugly, ugly areas of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| as well as many other roads in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| because of the sign blights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| the many signs that make it ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| We ask you to follow the lead of other areas of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| consider reducing the sign height in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| so that it can be a good model rather than a bad one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| This is truly an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| This is an opportunity for you to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| what is still a lovely part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| and let it grow in a very nice way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| in a way that it's prosperous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| that helps the people who live there and who helps us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| and in a way that helps us bring in industry to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| because we all want this area to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| We all care about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Let me flip to the next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| This is what the absence of planning looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Ms. Affell, you have about two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1259)|
| 0:20:59| I'm sorry, Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Klein, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| This is what it looks like a little bit closer into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| This is what we don't want to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| This is Cheryl Hill, and it is, as I said, quite pristine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| You can see there are no signs there at all in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| is the old Kroger's Marketplace Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Ed South, and Windsor Square Developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| and they have such establishments as Captain D's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| a Bank of America, McDonald's, Fazoli, Perkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| All of these along the Kingston Pike frontage there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| have monument signs that range from five feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| to 12 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| In front of Cedar Springs Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| and Kingston Pike just about a block away from Cheryl Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| is a section that has a tree-lined median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| To my knowledge, it's the only part of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| that has a tree-lined median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| It is, as I said, an area that we would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| somewhat protected and to become a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Franklin Square, about a mile and a half on further west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| marks the west end of what we refer to out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| as the Cedar Springs District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| The signage in Franklin Square is brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| It is traditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| It is, at the most, about 30 or 35 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| Even the car dealerships across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| there's a Harper's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| several different Harper's dealerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| the maximum height there is 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| This picture shows a few other signs along the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| The south side of Kingston Pike there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| is backed up by five different subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| thousands of homes, literally thousands of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| go between Kingston Pike and North Shore in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And we want to be your customer base out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| and we'd really like to see you treat us nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| All right, Ms. Kline, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| That's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Ms. Kline, in order to make this presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| a part of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| are you able to print off these pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| and furnish them to the city recorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I'm going to ask Joyce Bell, has she arrived yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| Okay, if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| May I speak for her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| I do know that she anticipated this being toward the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| because it was at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| We'll come back to her later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| The next person will be Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Mr. Mayor, members of City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I am here on behalf of the developer owner of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| and we are opposed to the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Let me give you a very short background about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Several years ago, this 100 acre plus tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| which has been in the city for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| was partially rezoned for a mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| At the top of the hill, we are developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| and there are already built 350 new apartment dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| There is a senior living center that is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| that will ultimately be built on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| There are offices that will ultimately be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| And on the frontage on Kingston Pike is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Property was acquired by my clients for $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| from a family that consisted of 13 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| none of whom lived in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| or Knox County for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| We contemplate that when the project is built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| the value will be between 180 million and $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| So it will be a boon to the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| of the city of Knoxville, increased tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| not only property tax, but sales tax too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| And we have not put that into the figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| It will pay both city and county taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| based upon that valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| The appeal in this case was filed by an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| called the Seven Oaks East Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| and the West Knox County Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| not the West Knoxville Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| The appellants are not residents of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| and we suggest to you that they have no standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| to bring this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| As a matter of fact, the West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| the Seven Oaks East Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| is not even in the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| and could not be annexed into the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| if it wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| To date, three signs have been approved for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| And let me run through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Aldi's has purchased a tract of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| and they went through a public process at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and had a 25-foot sign approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| There was no opposition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Gordon's Food Service has purchased their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| They went through a public process at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| with no opposition and obtained approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| for a 30-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| We are asking for a 50-foot development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| However, I have offered a compromise on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| so that stores that are not on the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| and the apartments can have identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| The apartments are barely visible from Kingston Pike there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| at the back of the property on the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| They need some indication on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| that they are located up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| Academy Sports is not located on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| They need to go on a development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| We have, in process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| we're working on a sale to some other national retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| for the remaining piece of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| They will not be fronting on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| All of the people who are in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| were advised that the city would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| a 50-foot development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| as it does other signs in other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| They are now being told by our opponents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| no, we don't want 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| They're wanting to change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| in the middle of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| It's like in the fourth quarter of a football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Your team's marching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| You've made two first downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| You're coming up on the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| They say, all right, on this series of downs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| you've got to go 20 yards rather than 10 in four downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| We're going to change the rules right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| I don't think it's fair to change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| These people relied upon what they were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| by your city code's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| that they could have a 50-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| You only have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| They have cited examples of signs from other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| I doubt if there are any two cities in this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| or anywhere else that have the exact same sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| These people, our clients, and our tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| have relied upon what they were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| To tell them now that you can't build a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| over 25 feet after they were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| they could have a sign up to 30 feet is to break faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| and certainly is not helpful to developing other interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| in the city of Knoxville from retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Nonetheless, 50 feet was approved by MPC 14 to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| We have gone back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Our developers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| We have gone back and in an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| to negotiate in good faith, we will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| That's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| And the next person to sign up is Mike Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| What the hell is this here now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I'm Mike Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| I live at 8827 Belmena Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| which is in the Plantation Springs development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| that our company did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| I've been there for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| and it's less than five minutes from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I am also employed with Oliver Smith Realty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| for the last 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| I've been in the real estate business since 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| So this tells you how old I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| I was very fortunate many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| This project goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| and that's what I'd like to explain a few things on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I represented the family even prior to the 14 heirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| finally getting the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| because there was a life estate on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| It was Mr. Schill's second wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| So therefore, we spent three years, six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| trying to sell the property for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| She was getting ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Her house was in disarray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| and she wanted to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| It's very difficult to work out the life estate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| However, we got three contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| and then nobody wanted to compete with Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Turkey Creek had it all, so they all fell apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Unfortunately, Mrs. Schill passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| I think that was four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Mr. Raymond Higgins came to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| on behalf of the Andrews Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| represented by a very close friend of mine in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| He's also an ex-Knoxville boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| He went to Central High School in the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| I have been in Knoxville since 1946, December the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| That's when I was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I grew up in Lonsdale and I'm very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Graduated from rural high school, as did all my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| I also lived in South Knoxville on South Haven Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I lived on Worcester Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| and I have lived in Western Knoxville since 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| So I have been all over our town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| as a resident and a very proud member of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Now, what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| is when Mr. Higgins came to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| there were some real firsts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| and I've been in this business a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| The first thing he wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| was to meet with all of MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| He wanted to meet with our city representative, Ms. Spillo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| and spend a lot of time with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| They had never done a project in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| They wanted to know all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| They wanted to know what the attitudes were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| as well as the regs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| That was quite a beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I spent hours in day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Then we met with homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Ms. Spillo was very active in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| We met with Ms. Churches at Gettysview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| and other places to get their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| The property is 104 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| It's tremendously long, got a lot of depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I have never seen buffer zones so wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| on somebody that paid so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| to put them in buffer zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| which you cannot recoup your money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| when you put them in buffer zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| So that was the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| There were a lot of encroachments on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| people that had built parts of swimming pools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| fences, some outbuildings, yada, yada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| Mr. Higgins decided to quit-claim those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| or work with each one of those individual homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| rather than some long, drawn-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| which some other developer probably would have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| So that was the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| As we progressed, the recession comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Tough for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| I've been through 21% days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I've been through Black Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| I've been through about everything you can go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| in the economy since 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| This one, nobody saw coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| We're very fortunate that the Floranoi Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| out of Columbus, Georgia, came into Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| and became not only our apartment multifamily developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| but also our project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Saw another first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| The first thing they did was create a luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| at Calhoun's Restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| invited all city council people, county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| everybody that was an inspector, fire, police, codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| put on a luncheon and a seminar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| and their words were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| we do not want to start out doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Come to our site every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Tell us if anything's wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| so you don't have to come back and tell us to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| So that was that attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| So from day one to present day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| every government body we have in our town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| has been met with, dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| The homeowners, for I thought quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| were becoming satisfied because they had feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| So now they've coincided with the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| One minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| And I don't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| I'm getting calls from all over the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Relationships I've had for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Charlotte, Atlanta, Kentucky, all around the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| What are you all doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Everything's dead here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| There's no activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| When we announced the Academy of Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| it was on a Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| On Friday, Publix announced, Costco's announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| and I think Kroger's announced in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| And what it's doing for our town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| in the middle of this recession is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| It's not just retail jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| It's the boys that get their boots dirty like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| That's the plumbers, electricians, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| This is incredible for what's going on in my hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I don't know what else these people could have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I'm an OT, UT football player for Doug Dickey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| and they have burned it at all ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| So appreciate your time, and we hope you'll sit our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Let me go back now to Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Are you now here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| If you would come down and give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Thought there was going to be another issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| preceding this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| and I'm here representing Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Scenic Knoxville, which represents members and supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| in both the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| supports reversal of the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| to allow any 50-foot signs in the Cheryl Hill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| In many ways, Knoxville has been a leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| in setting a progressive sign policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| which protects the aesthetics of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| It passed a ban on new billboards in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| kept digital billboards illegal in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| and enacted a ban on new electronic message centers in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| We should continue this trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| by requiring attractive signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| at a reasonable height for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Allowing very tall signs whose purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| is to overshadow the surrounding environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| and surrounding signage is a tactic in the arms race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| to bigger and taller signs that ultimately no one can win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| because there will always be someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| who requests a bigger and taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Although progressive in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| allowable sign heights and size is one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| where Knoxville lags behind other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I think you saw some statistics on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Not only is the allowable height of 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| too tall to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| the situation has been made worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| by lax boards of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| which have a long history of freely granting variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| for even taller signs without a valid hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| It is time to review, revise, and tighten our sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and begin to clean up the unsightly sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| we have allowed to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| We live in a beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| We could have a beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| At the recent East Tennessee Quality Growth Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| John Shore, Tennessee Commissioner of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| and former mayor of Franklin, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| said that he felt the economic success of Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| and he said this in a keynote address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| that the economic success of Franklin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| was due in large part to strict zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| which resulted in quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| And Ed McMahon, who was invited here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| by our own Metropolitan Planning Commission a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| a renowned authority on sustainable development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| and urban design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| has written that communities are afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| to say no to bad development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| because they're afraid they won't have any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| but it's only by saying no to bad development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| that they will attract good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Some people think that giving business what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| means they are pro-business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| even if it means supporting bad development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| But supporting bad development is not pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| It's anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Cheryl Hill may not be bad development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| but it is definitely bad signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| and it is time to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| Our next person is Brad Salisbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Am I pronouncing it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Mr. Mayor, he's on our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| May I take his, just to finish up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| use his five minutes to finish up what I was-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Let me confer with Attorney Swanson on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Is that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| No, you can't do that, but I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| If that was the last speaker-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| That's our last speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| I have a suggestion to make to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| because what happened with this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| got a little turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| We have a procedure designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| where the appellant has three speakers who speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| and then the person who is opposed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| or the group who is opposed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| then gets three speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| and then we have a two-minute rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| as a general rule for the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| In this case, we sort of got out of whack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| with regard to our speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| and I think that may create some level of unfairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| with regard to the ability of Mr. Seymour's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| in this instance, to be able to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| So my suggestion to you is that there be a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| to amend the rules to allow Mr. Seymour to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| for three minutes and then to allow a three-minute rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| by the original appellant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| which is different than our usual rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| but I think it would be fair under the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| as to how this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| And I'll move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Ayes have it, and so ought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| So you may go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Arthur Seymour, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| We're not asking for any kind of variance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| 50 feet is the permitted height in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| The sign across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| there's been a great deal of talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| That has been measured by Brad Salisbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| at Cannon & Cannon Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| That sign's 41 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| I've heard that it's anywhere from 30 to 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| It is from base to top 41 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| Now, as I was talking a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| in response to concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| we have gone back and looked at the signage package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Here's what the developer would offer to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| We would reduce the development directory sign to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| We would limit the signage on three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| that are unsold at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| which are one R2, one R3, and one R5 to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| And we have the authority to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| because we still own those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| That would enable us to get signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| on the development directory sign that is visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| There's a billboard, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| that nobody talks about that's on property adjacent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| It's 40 feet high, just to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| This would enable us to get signage on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| for the Amberley Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| which are not visible from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| And they've got 350 apartments up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| For Academy Sports, a major new retailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| coming into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| And for two other retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| that we are presently negotiating with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| who will not have frontage on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| and who probably will not come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| unless they can have signage that shows on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| We think this is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| We are giving up feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| It's not what our opponents want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| They want Gordon's and Aldi's reduced to 10 or 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| And they did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| although one I know was here on the Aldi sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| they did not oppose those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| We have no control over Aldi's or Gordon's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| But we think this is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| This is a good-looking development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| It's won the city of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| what we hope we'll be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| It is coming in during very difficult times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Mr. Higgins, Ms. Andrews, and Flournoy Development Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| have done a magnificent job on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| and we look forward to finishing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| And that will take care of the signage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| basically, on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| And we would ask you to approve our compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| We have a three-minute rebuttal from the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| whoever wants to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2613)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2623)|
| 0:43:43| I will speak for those who are appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| I'd like to just say that, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| a lot has been said about this development having 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Only about 36 acres are commercial out of that mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| The entire development is on an upward slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| And I'm sorry to disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| but I pass by it every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| And the apartments definitely are visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| from Kingston Pike, as well as the Academy Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| The Academy Building, in fact, is virtually complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| on the outside, and all of the exterior structure is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| I don't think anyone is going to refuse to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| I have, in the process of the last two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| doing research, traveled around to Franklin, Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| a number of other places in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| that have lower signage restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And I will swear on a stack of Bibles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| that Academy has about a six-foot sign on a major roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| and it is not even within a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| And I know that Gordon Food Service and Aldi, as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| have very low monument signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| in Murfreesboro and Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| And they are putting in new construction in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| and will also have low signage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| The proposition for a 40-foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| is not acceptable to us whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| It is going to be put on a 12-foot berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| That would give it a 52-foot elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| The sign across the street that has been mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| many times as having 40, 41 feet in height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| is a non-conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Tootie McCook and myself were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| We consulted with both the city codes folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| and the county codes folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| because many of the signs out there were permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| at a time when it was part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And that particular sign in question across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| may be 40 feet, no one seems to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| However, it is a non-conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| We would ask for 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| We would ask for that to be at the grade of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| If they want to put it on top of a 12-foot berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| we would ask for that to be adjusted accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I have done research on a number of the different ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Alcoa is 20 feet, Pigeon Forge, 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Sevierville, 25, Morristown, 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Nashville, 20, Chattanooga, 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Franklin, 15, Murfreesboro, 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| Barragette, six, Knoxville is 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I think you all recognize that it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| for us to make some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| and I think this is a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| The criteria to judge height in most cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| is that you measure from the existing grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| or the grade of the street, whichever is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| In this case, you should measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| from the grade of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| I'd like to once more read what we now have as an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| which says a master signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| I must ask you to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| that you have reached your three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| I'll click now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| All right, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| I was the one that asked that this be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| for two weeks so that we could get the parties together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| and see what we might be able to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| in terms of some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| First of all, I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| that everyone understands that both the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| and the development group have tried to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I think there's been a cooperative effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| on both people's part in terms of the respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| I know what Mr. Price was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| in terms of this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| wanting this to be a very good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I did attend the luncheon that the contractor had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| when they started out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| I think that what's happening here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| and I think that what Mr. Seymour mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| about the Aldi sign and the Gordon Food signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| I think that all of us realize at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| that some things do slip by and we're not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| However, this particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| with the development sign did catch attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| What we have here, I think, is a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| in terms of what the height of that sign ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Both the developers and the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| have looked at different heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| The development group has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| I know they have worked with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| in terms of doing visual images| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| in terms of what the sizes of the sign ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| 50 feet on top of a 10-foot berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| as you all know, is a 60-foot high sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| It's almost a sign that, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| a lot of our signs along the interstates are that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| What we have here is not a situation of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| that this piece of property is surrounded by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| This is not a county-city issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| What this is, this is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| of what we want our city to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| from an aesthetic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| When you drive down Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| you don't know whether you're in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| or you're in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| But one thing you do know is that you're in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| And there's a certain amount of clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| that if we go out Broadway, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Kingston Pike, portions of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| that we have all kinds of visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| We have one remaining area in this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| on Kingston Pike that, as Ms. Klein had pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| you have a tree-lined street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| a portion of a major road that goes into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| that has trees down the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| We have a section of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| from where the new Kroger's is gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| on out to Franklin Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| where people have respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| what they thought signs ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| The development across the street that they talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| which is where the Kroger's and the Home Depot is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| they do have a sign, Marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| That sign, you've heard from different folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| in terms of the approximate height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| but that sign's approximately 41 feet from Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| in terms of the height of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| As you go down Kingston Pike from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| where the Kroger's is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Kroger's has a sign up on their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| You go on down, you have Captain D's, you have McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Now, all of us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| and all of us that grew up with McDonald's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| we know the Golden Arches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Generally, those are anywhere from, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| 50 feet or higher, it seems like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| when you see a McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| But this particular McDonald's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| their sign out front along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| along the stretch that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| is only 12 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Then you go on down, you have Captain D's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| You heard you have Captain D's before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| but you have a couple of banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| The TVA Credit Union does not have a sign out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| They have a sign on their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| You go on further down and you have Perkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| And those signs, again, are under 12 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| Now, what's been interesting the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| and I've met with the developers out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| I've met with the people from Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| we've met out on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| and if you go out there now, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| what Mr. Seymour was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| yes, there is a group of apartments at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| In fact, it's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I was driving down the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| You can see those apartments from the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| up on the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| But if you're on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| if you go out there now and look at Academy Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| that building is such that you see it from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| I would dare say that all the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| that are going to go on to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| you're going to be able to see from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| But nevertheless, what I see as the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| is you've got to stretch a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| across from an area that's already been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| that has decent looking signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| And as you folks know how I feel about signs in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| but they have a group of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| that go down the one side of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| On this particular side, the Cheryl Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| there could be seven signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| the master directory sign or the development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| could be 50 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| And the other six signs on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| could also be 50 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Now my wish and what I would hope is that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| we could have a development directory sign of 30 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| which would put it 40 feet above Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| which would put it at the same elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| as the sign across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| And if we could hold the monument signs to 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| then also let me just say that if you go out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| the contractor has an eight foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| where the Gordon Foods is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| And you can read that from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| just like you can read the 12 foot McDonald's sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| But if we could have that, then hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| and this is being hopeful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| that maybe by doing that, getting the other four parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| to have a monument sign of 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| that then there could be some discussions with Aldi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| and some discussions with Gordon Food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| who have not yet built their sign yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Yes, they have their permit, but they haven't built the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| And maybe we could get them to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| the importance of having a uniform sign package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| All people would need to do is go out to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I don't think we say that Turkey Creek's a failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| in terms of the signage package they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| So, again, I think what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| is we have a difference of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| between the development group and the neighborhood group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| and we're looking at a difference of 10 to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| So at the appropriate time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Mr. Mayor, I'd like to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| but I think there may be some of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| that would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| All right, I don't see any other lights right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Mr. Seymour, let me ask you a question about 25 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Is that something that's, for your clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| is that something that's going to cause you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| some type of hardship, or it's just going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| where it's not going to be a good advertisement, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| It's going to cause hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| and I'll tell you two reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| The Academy Sports and the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| understood when they developed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| that the city allowed up to a 50 foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| To get above the signs that have already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| by MPC and acquiesced in by the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| we have come to the conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| that we have to have a 40 foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| for the apartments and Academy Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| and two other tenants that we're hoping to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| to another large piece of commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| that does not front on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| What those people will do, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| I cannot predict, but in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Academy Sports and the apartments understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| and were told that there was a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| that could go on Kingston Pike 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| identifying their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Yes, 25 feet will be below signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| that have already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| It would be worthless to build a 25 foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| All right, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Yes, Mr. Mayor, also I just want to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| that for the record that I gave each one of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| some information regarding the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| and want to just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| that they are part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| That was comparison of sign ordinances in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| You have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| You also have a copy of the proposed sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| for Academy Sports along with pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| showing the heights of those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| And then also I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| that one of the things that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| is that we talk about uniformity and consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| of signs that are within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| And again, I'm stressing the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| that from a visual standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| that I hope that we consider very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| how important it is to maintain the beauty that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| and the beauty along this stretch of highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| And when we talk about consistency and uniformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| the one document that I gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| verifies the heights of the signs in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| And you'll notice that there is a consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| and uniformity to the heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| The signs that are listed, again, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| McDonald's is 12 feet, Franklin Square, 17.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Windsor Square Shopping Center, 31.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| We go on down, Bank of America is seven feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church, 19 feet, 10 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Cedar Springs Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| which is adjacent to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| is 40 feet, six inches tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| And we go on down and list the number of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Now Marketplace Shopping Center sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| which is across the street, is really a nonconforming sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| but that's the sign that we'd like to match with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| And it is 40 feet, 40 feet high at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| So again, it's part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| I'd like to have those documents so noted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| With that, Mr. Mayor, what I'd like to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| I'd like to move to amend or modify the approved plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| by reducing the height of the sign from 50 feet to 30 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| and with that modification to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Councilman Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Yes, I'm not sure of precision where we are at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| but I was wondering if-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Can we still discuss this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Let me start with, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| with asking Mr. Swanson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| We have this in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| MPC has already acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| If we change the criteria, not the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| but the heights that are approved in our action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| does it go back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| or what is the procedural mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| if we do anything other than just up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| in voting on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I will give my opinion on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| but I would like to get Mr. Donaldson's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| It's my belief that the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| has considered the heights of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| so if you were to modify the height of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| as proposed in this motion, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| to be reduced, I think, by 30 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I would think that the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| it's on the record, they considered the height of this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Now, they didn't consider 100, 120 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| They considered 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| and there was discussion at the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| Commission about the sign being lower than the 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| and they adopted the 50 feet standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| So they considered the range that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| It would be my view that they considered the range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| and therefore, it would not have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| but it's certainly possible that I have that wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| and I would defer to the greater expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| in that area of Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Well, then I'll direct my question to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| and if you'll tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| if we act within that range that is up to 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| do you consider it necessary to have MPC review that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| In this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| you don't have to take the considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| of the Planning Commission into effect at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| You're acting on an appeal of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and as such, you're acting de novo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| and the zoning code gives you the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| to affirm, modify, impose restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| or overrule the action of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| So you're starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| So the buck ends here, so to speak, or rests here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| All right, Mr. Mayor, if I can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| I think that it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| that we look at this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| I know that one of the persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| several of the persons that spoke talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| and the question was raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| are we changing the rules within the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| in the middle of the game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| But the ordinance for a master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| clearly says that it is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| to promote the use of signs which are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| and they're not numbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| but I'm gonna number them for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| are aesthetically pleasing, that's one criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| of appropriate scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| and that's this height and size kind of width thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| and three, integrated with surrounding buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| in landscape, and then it has sort of an explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| of why those criteria are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| and it says, in order to meet the community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| expressed desire for quality development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| consistent with the property's land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| And then, of course, it goes on to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| review by MPC and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| But those criteria seem to me to be broad enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| for us to tackle a question that's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| and that question, you can pose it many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| but one way is, what do we wanna be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| What do we wanna end up looking like as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| And all of us have traveled to other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| and we've gone to places where the signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| and the setbacks, and the landscaping in front of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| is more pleasing than we currently see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| in places in Knoxville, and I think the reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| to most people that travel is that those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| pleasant places to be, that it's nice to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| that it's comforting to see not too much clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| and some kind of good landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Long story short, this section of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| is being developed with a slightly smaller scale of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| than we see in places that are in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| that have been around a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| and there has been this sort of race for signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I think it's clearly within the purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| of what we're doing here that we take a hard look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| at this signage question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| I don't know if there's a magic number, I honestly don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| I'm pleased to hear that the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| wanted to pick a 40-foot limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| That certainly shows that they're trying to work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| and I think that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Since they put the location on a berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| they get an extra advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| they get that extra 10 or 12 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| and 40 feet is really 50 or 52 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| It seems to me that when I look at this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| that we have in the record of the verified heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| of the signs in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| something in the range of 20 to 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| seems to be permissible in terms of scale and comparability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| Certainly how you build it makes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| either attractive or unattractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| but I think that we could be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| say, a 35-foot sign here that would still give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| the ability to tell the world they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| That's what the reason for this monumental sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| in the front of the developer's sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| and yet not kind of overwhelm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| the visual pleasing nature of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| So I don't know if Mr. Grave would entertain a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| but I'd suggest that we pick 35 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| as the height of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Listening to this discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| several thoughts come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Obviously, there's a need for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| to look at the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| There's consideration among a lot of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| that 50 feet is pretty tall for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| That being said, this discussion reminds me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| of two very unfortunate experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| that the UT football team had at the end of the season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| when the clock was running out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| and somehow extra seconds got added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| or different things occurred that were game changers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| literally game changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| And I see that same thing happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| When this group came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| when the property was presented to potential tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| 50 feet was the height, maximum height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| That's what the rules were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| That's what the law was at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| We may not like what that law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| We may not like what that rule is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| and we probably really need to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| so that we don't keep addressing this issue every few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| But the bottom line, from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| and I don't mean disrespect to the county homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| in regard to this city's issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| I think the bottom line is that a set of rules was in play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| and for us to drastically modify those rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| is not necessarily a message that we want to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| as other developers and other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| look to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| We've talked often at council about the economic condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| and the fact that this isn't the strongest economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| in the world, and yet we have new businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| coming to Cheryl Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| We have other new businesses that are coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| So this is clearly in the eyes of companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| that are in other cities that we're compared with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| as far as attractions or businesses they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| So I'm really concerned that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| a substantively lower sign than MPC approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| The developer has indicated a 40-foot acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| that the tenants would go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Is that correct, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Okay, and I really think that for us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| something lower than that is not in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| This may well be the last development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| that has a sign this tall if we approve a sign tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| And I do think that we probably need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| to look at the heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| There seems to be a will for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| I know that Vice Mayor Bailey has something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| coming up later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| But right now, we're addressing a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| that apparently we're trying to change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| just as the UT football team experienced two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| And I know that did not make a lot of people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| First of all, I want to thank everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| for their interest and for coming and for their passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| And I want to thank the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| for coming to Knoxville and taking a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| And when you talk about the tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| and sales tax, that's really how we offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| our property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| So thank you for coming and doing business with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Ms. Feld, when you mentioned some of the measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| that we've already taken in the last number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| to try to remove some of the sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| and some of the problems we have with signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| you know, we've been part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| And we're also taking other measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| as it pertains to our ridge tops and hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| and slopes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| And so we're very much conscious of our natural beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| and the mountains and the scenery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| and we all want to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| That is an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| When you talk about Commissioner Schur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| and Mayor Franklin, former Mayor Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| and the strict zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| I think we have, as a council, identified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| As a community, we've identified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| And we all wish that we could go back in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| and change some of these things, but we really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| And if I were developing this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| because I don't think the higher your sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| the more successful you're apt to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| or I just think that signage high in the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| is not an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| And if I were doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| I would probably lower the signs if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| But I don't know if you can or if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| The concern I have is that this has been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| with the understanding and the belief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| and you've recruited and you've marketed the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| that suggests that you could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| well, that you have the right to go up to 50 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| And so for us to suggest that we can modify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| from where I'm sitting and what I'm looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| and what's important to me as a council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| is I don't think, I think you are legally allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| to build up to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| And I think it's within the developer's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| to go up to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| And so that's what I'm gonna look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| is what I think you're legally allowed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| So I'll listen to my colleagues and possibly come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| First, I wanna congratulate and applaud the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| for doing a lot of good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| in terms of how they unfolded their ideas to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| I also wanna thank Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| for being in the middle of this mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| and providing a lot of opportunity for conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| So I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| It seems to me that the ordinance suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| that you're allowed to build a sign up to 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| but you have to construct some level of legitimacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| and logic around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Just because the top limit is 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| doesn't necessarily mean that that's what you should go for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| The ordinance also suggests that you should create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| some sort of reason and logic around the size of your sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| I heard a lot of logic coming from Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| about why 30 feet with that 10 foot berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| making it 40 feet makes a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| So I don't really think that it's changing the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| I think that it's actually supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| what the ordinance is wanting to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| Is it could go up to 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| but I don't hear a logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I don't hear a logic for why it needs to be 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| But 30 feet from Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| his amendment, he's created that kind of a logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| It's uniform, it creates a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| it's consistent with what is already existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| in that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| So that's why I seconded his motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| and that's why I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| I'd like to call on Mr. Donaldson first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| The creation of the development directory sign indicator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| in our code, talk to us a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| Was it not designed to reduce signage elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| within the development or to coordinate signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| It seems like the first time we used it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| was perhaps in the Turkey Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| And what would the developer's alternative have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| if they had chosen not to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| the development directory sign model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| The development directory sign is called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| under the regulations in place for the master sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| In order to get a development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| which is an off-premise sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| you need to have an approved master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| The ordinance lays out its purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| to encourage coordinated and well-designed sign systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| that allow sufficient identification of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| within unified developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| And subject to meeting the following criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| and the first one is that the development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| shall meet the requirements of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| for a business or ground sign or monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| And the requirements are that you can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| up to 50 feet in height and up to 275 feet of sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| The sign, as proposed and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| by the Planning Commission, met that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| So, the only way that you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| a development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| which allows businesses that are perhaps not on a frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| to have a presence on a frontage road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| is to go through a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Okay, so the second half of my question, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| is had the developer chosen to approach this differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| and not utilize the development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| which coordinates all the signage on one face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| what would their alternative have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| and what would that have looked like in terms of height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| In the absence of a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| each lot owner would be able to apply for signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| under the regulations of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| So, every lot could have a 50 foot high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| 275 foot ground sign or monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| Or a sign on a tall pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Up to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Now, they are subject, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| to being within a planned commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| so the Planning Commission does have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| to see that and approve a sign package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| as part of a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And, for example, the Academy Sports Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| has an approved development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| and they have an approved monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| that is 10 feet tall and about 50 feet of sign area on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| And I'm sure that they did that knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| that they were gonna have a presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| on the development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| with frontage that fronts on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| First of all, I guess I'd like to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| some of the comments of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| around the table tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| and that is certainly to thank both the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| and the homeowners that are involved in this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| for coming together in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| to talk about a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| I think finding consensus in any of these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| can be tough, and I think when folks come to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| with the right attitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| we can come out with a good outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I really appreciate the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| of Councilman Palmer and Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| I think when all of us were sworn into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| we swore to uphold the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| and the code of ordinances of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| whether we like them or we don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| It's not a subjective thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Now, there's certainly room in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| as we've heard tonight from Councilman Woodhull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| for some discretion there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| but I feel very strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| as Councilwoman Palmer expressed so well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| with her analogy with the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| that folks need to know the rules of the game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| when they're coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| and it's simply not fair, it's not good government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| to try to change the rules in the middle of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Is this something we need to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Yes, when Vice Mayor Becker was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| we talked about overhauling our entire sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| It's something that's long overdue in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| but to do it in the middle of a development project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| in the middle of a recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| when we have investors, developers, property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| business people who are willing to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| it's simply not only unfair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| it's unwise to try to change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| in the middle of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Mr. Seymour, on behalf of his team tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| has offered a 20% reduction in the height of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| The amendment that Councilman Grieve offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| is a 40% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| I think 20% is a great compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| I think the reason why I asked the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| to Mr. Donaldson this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| was to try to underline that a coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| master sign plan with a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| is part of our code to try to encourage developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| to do good planning within a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| and to coordinate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| And the alternative would have been for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| to allow every single property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| to have up to a 50-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Instead, they got together with their major tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| their major investors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| as they put together this development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| offered the idea of a coordinated development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| with generally monument signs on the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| As Mr. Seymour pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| there are two signs already approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| water over the dam, that are 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| A development directory sign that's also 30 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| simply is not in scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| Those businesses that have been promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| to be on the development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| have been promised greater visibility and greater exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| I certainly can support Mr. Seymour's offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| to do a 40-foot sign in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| That's a 20% reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| but I can't support the 30-foot proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| With all due respect to both council ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| this is not a football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| What we're looking at here is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| that's going to affect the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| and the future of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| And what we're trying to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| is to come up with a compromise that has signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| that deals with signage that's already in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| And so, to me, this is not, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| this is not a last-minute football play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| What it is, we're trying to come up with a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| of a sign package that will fit that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| And with that, what I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| when you talk about a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| do these folks actually have a master sign plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| I mean, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| what we're really looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| is a development directory sign on a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| that we have no requirements for what the other signs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| And in conversation, or with what Ms. Roddy says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| that in looking at the plan that I have before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| there are seven sign locations on Kingston Pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| And what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| is the development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| but then the other six signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| have the potential of being 50 feet high also, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| They do, although they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| in a planned commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| which requires development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| So what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| We will see what the sign proposals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| and approve accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| The one development plan that we've approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| the most recent development plan that we've approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| on a lot off of Kingston Pipe had a single sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| a 10 foot high monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| with 50 square feet of sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| Well, then how did Aldi and Johnson Foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| get their approval of 25 and 30 feet high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| They have frontage on Kingston Pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| so they asked for a pole sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| and they asked for 25 feet in the one case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| and 30 feet in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Okay, so then the other four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| could also be up to 50 feet high in that area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| Yes, they all could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Okay, I guess what I don't understand-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| In fact, in the absence of a master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| that creates a development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| they more than likely would ask for a taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| What do we actually have with this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| We have a master-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| The master sign plan that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| was for the creation of the development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| And nothing else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| That's the only sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| the specific plans for a sign that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| So I really don't understand what we have in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| we have no, the only control that you have over a sign then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| is the directory sign, the development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| The other signs are not part of the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| The only way that they can get a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| is to get an approved master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Now, as projects come along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| they can amend the master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| as lots are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| and the planning commission approves development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| But they have specified on this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| that they will use monument signs on most of the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| and they acknowledge the two pole signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| on the two grocery store lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| So as far as a master sign plan goes then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| you don't have to specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| the size of the signs that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Prior to any permits being issued, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| Okay, so what we do have before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| is an authorized legal master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| For the purpose of creating the development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| So again, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| I hope my colleagues understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| So, but again, what we're looking at is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| and believe me, I appreciate what the developers have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| And it's kind of interesting to me that Costco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| which is one of the largest companies in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| has decided to go to Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| where Farragut has much stricter rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| than what Knoxville does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| And so it's hard for me to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| that people will not come to a good development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| in a good area in terms of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| And I'm definitely not anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| I don't think the neighborhoods that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| the groups that I've talked to are against the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| as far as people coming into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| But I think what all of us are looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| is we're looking for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| to keep the beauty of what we have and the aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| and not go ahead and repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| what we have on the rest of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And granted, maybe we are changing the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| but I think that's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| that we as leaders need to be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| And we need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| we need to look at what is best for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| not just what is best for that particular neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| or that particular business that comes to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| What we need to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| is what is best for the overall city that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| And we have an opportunity to set an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| of a stretch of a busy commercial highway area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| that could really look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| And it's our responsibility to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| I really feel very strongly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| And I think that we have an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| to maintain the aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| maintain that area of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| and if anything, use that as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| as we get into looking at our signage thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| that we have been talking about for about a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| in terms of trying to look at the entire package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| But I think we can really use that as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| of what we want our city to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| what we want to stretch along our major corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| to look like and use that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| So I would hope that we have support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| for this motion that I've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Councilman Grieve, I did not mean to make light of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| by using some football analogies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| I thought that was something that most people would grasp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| because that's very fresh in our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I'm thinking about the jobs that are going to be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| as this development unfolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| I'm thinking about the jobs that are going to be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| by the people who work in the businesses that come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| And I'm thinking about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| that there was clear understanding by the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| on what the procedures were, what the ordinances were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| at the time that the developer made the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| and did identify businesses who wanted to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| What Costco did in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| what Whole Foods is going to do on Paper Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| really doesn't have anything to do with this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| because we're looking at a development on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| from a very old piece of property that has a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| has businesses that want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Some will have frontage on Kingston Pike, some will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| But people need to be able to see what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| And a directory sign that is no higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| than other signs that have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| or in fact maybe lower to me is just totally inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| I don't disagree that we really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| to look at our sign ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| We talk about clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| I'm really distressed by the clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| of the roofing repair signs, the daycare signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| the food signs that pop up on the right-of-way all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| I know we're in political season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| so we'll have that clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| But I just am concerned that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| a lot of cluttered signs to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| Some are tall and some are short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| And I don't think that we need to have Cheryl Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| be the one where we decide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| well, we're just gonna change the game plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| and this is what we're gonna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| This question is for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| And this is simply a point of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| to follow up on Councilman Grieve's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| We have a document in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| that was prepared by Canon and Canon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| And the most recent date on it, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| is May 27th of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| And it shows the property and indicates the various signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| And the monument sign is indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| And then there are quite a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| excuse me, the development directory sign is indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And then there are quite a number of monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| indicated on parcels throughout this property development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| There are two monopole signs on parcels of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| that have frontage on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| And I assume those are the two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| that have the 30-foot and the 40-foot signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| that are already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Is this a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| that your team is committed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Because my understanding is that a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| then coordinated all of the other signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| within the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Is this a conceptual drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| or is this what your team is committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| in terms of how you build out this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| We are committed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| And we have agreed to limit the three of the other lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| on Kingston Pike to 15-foot signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| as part of our offer of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| We'll bring the development directory sign down to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| It will identify tenants who are not on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| We will limit three other frontage lots to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| The fourth lot, Councilman Grieve and I have discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| is right next to a billboard that is 40 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| That will have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| the same public approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Mr. Donaldson mentioned a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| but we'd like a little flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| It will not be 50 feet high, I can assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| But that lot, which is on the far east end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| of the development, may need a little more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| to deal with the billboard that partially blocks it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Okay, but this plan that we're looking at tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| within the compromise that you stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| with the two other Kingston Pike frontage lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| is the master sign plan, the coordinated sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| for this development that your team is committed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| You know, I'm listening to Councilwoman Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| and the other speakers, and I must say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| that this is a tough question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| because of where we are in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| but I do take issue with the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| that somehow the developers are being given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| a new process or a new set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| One of the rules that's always been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| is that the MPC will look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| will approve up to 50 feet, that's a maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| that's not a required amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| and that if someone disagrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| that that decision meets the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| in the ordinance of aesthetically pleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| of appropriate scale, and all that other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| that they will have a right to appeal to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| So we're in the very process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| that they knew existed from the outset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| so it is not unfair in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Having said that, I appreciate the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| that there's been a lot of effort in planning the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| and again, the master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| according to Mr. Donaldson, is only submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| insofar as this directory sign is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| and the other pieces are being looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| and penciled in, I guess, by canon and canon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| but are not part of the approved sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| So I don't think we're leaving the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| that everyone entered into voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| when they applied for approval of a master sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| They are just in the later phases of the very same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| Again, I think that it is good that they have come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| and said, we're trying to be more reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| In light of the berm, if they have the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| across the road on the level ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| 40 feet sounds like a pretty decent offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| When you put it on a 10 to 12 foot berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| you really still got a 50 foot plus sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| So I'd like to see us somewhere around 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| and then let them have the berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| which gets them really to 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| But that's where we are, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| All right, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| I don't know if it's necessary to restate the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Do you want to restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Well, I think the motion will be to modify the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| for the sign, the development sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| to be a maximum height of 30 feet rather than 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| and otherwise approve the plan and deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| That's my understanding of the current motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| So let me just explain to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| because again, this is a little unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| what happens if you go through this vote and approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| then you will have modified this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| and the appeal will be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| and we'll be ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| If the vote is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| if you don't have five votes in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| of that particular motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| we're back to where we started from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| That doesn't operate to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| What it does is it leaves us right where we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| and at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| there needs to be either a motion to approve the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| a motion to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| or a different motion to modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| You can put a different number in there if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| Essentially, the first vote is on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| First vote is changing that sign height to 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| All right, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Let's take a roll call vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| No, I'm holding out for 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| So, it has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5511)|
| 1:31:58| 11A is a resolution to honor the memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| of First Lieutenant Thomas J. Williams, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| and Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Earl Dan Cole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| and to offer sincere condolences to their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| upon the occasion of their deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| And let me say on behalf of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| certainly we want to express our deep appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| to the families and to these men for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| to execute a quick claim deed to Anthony Leiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| for one parcel of property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| at 2738 Washington Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| within the limits of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| pursuant to the Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| for a contract sales price of $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Before this motion comes to the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| I had a great conversation with Mrs. Wade this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| Director Wade, about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| And this is one of those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| where the city has done their very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| to help a disabled homeowner who was in great need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| but the end of the story didn't come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| exactly the way we wanted it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| And although we can't go back in time and change history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| I think it's important for taxpayers and citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| who are watching our proceedings to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| that we do react to these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| that some policies have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| The origination of this loan, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| goes back to 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| and Director Wade can explain some of that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| But if you will indulge me and indulge her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| I think it's helpful to understand how we got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| and also to understand what we've learned from this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| and some things that we've changed in our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| so that hopefully we don't end up in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| with taxpayer dollars like this going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| I'll be glad to give you some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| This is a house that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| through our Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| funded with federal funds that the city receives annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| As you recall, we get those every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| You hear about them through the Annual Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| And the Owner-Occupied Rehab Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| is one of our largest programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| in the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| This citizen was elderly, disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| Her home was in disrepair to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| where it was less expensive to replace her home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| with a new one rather than rehabilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| the house she was living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| So a replacement home was built on her lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| on Washington Avenue in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| It's a modest house, two bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| but it was made accessible to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| with a ramp up to the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| And she was able to live there in decent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| that was accessible for her for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| So in some respects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| the goal of our program was met at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| However, the city takes it a step farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| And typically when we do an Owner-Occupied Rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| well, all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| those are structured as loans to the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| Some of them are deferred payment loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| so that they all don't have to be paid back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| but citizens do repay the loans to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| And that provides our department with program income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| that we can add to our existing funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| to create more housing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| for people, low-income persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| We did structure this as a loan to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| at the time of her death in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| The amount that was owed to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| was right at about $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| Her, the original loan was around $34,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| Her home went into foreclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| and the city made the decision to purchase the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| to protect the investment that we had in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| We paid off the first mortgage, about $16,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| And that was purchased by the city in August of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| right before the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| So we try, we put this in our Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| tried to market it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| At the time that we purchased the house in foreclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| it appraised at $50,000 with the independent appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| The appraisals we've received from independent appraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| throughout the years that this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| on our Homemakers Program has steadily declined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| because of the housing market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| and also because the house has not been lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| It has had some vandalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| The exterior heat and air unit was vandalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Some of the wiring was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| And we have shown this house numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| We've had a lot of interest in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| but this is the first time somebody has come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| and wanted to purchase the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| We feel like at this point that selling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| through our Homemakers for $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| will accomplish a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| It'll put it back on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| it'll get it rehabilitated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| and it'll get a family in that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| that has been vacant since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| We have lost money, no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| And in hindsight, possibly we wouldn't have bought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| at foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Had we known the housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| the situation that was coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| the fact that we couldn't market it for the appraised value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| and the appraised value has gone down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| we probably would have just cut our losses at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| But we did, we bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| So that's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| We have an opportunity now to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| And so that's the item before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| Ms. Roddy spoke about some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| that we've made in our procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| And we do extensive underwriting for all of our loans now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| Even though folks are low income that we serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| we make sure that they're able to pay the loans back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| and they are affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| but that they have certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| And Calvin Whitaker from my staff is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| who could talk at length about our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| for underwriting our loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Um, you know, we rarely buy properties at foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5919)|
| 1:38:47| I mean, we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| we, it's something that we think about long and hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| and we look at the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| and we need to know that they're marketable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| and in a location that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| we're gonna be able to market them before we buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| So we have made adjustments and that's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| My follow-up question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| and we talked about this before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| was our Homemakers Program that we are selling this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| does have a clawback kind of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| And can you explain for the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| if the individual that's buying this home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| for some reason doesn't complete the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| and the occupancy of this home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| what's the city's recourse in that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Right, the Homemakers Agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| allows the city to take the property back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| if the property is not rehabilitated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| is not, steps are not taken to rehabilitate the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| and get it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| The city has the authority to take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| That's built into the Homemakers Agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| So that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Occasionally we have done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| when things weren't built out on vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| So it is something that we exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| And the city is not required to pay back the homeowner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| No, we're not required to pay back the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| You know, I think community development has a dual role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| and one is certainly to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| our low- and moderate-income residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| in having safe, affordable, accessible housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| But it's also a goal to stabilize neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| And this house has sat vacant for too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| and I think the neighbors on Washington Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| deserve to have a great neighbor in this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| I'm sorry that it's been a learning experience for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| but I'm glad that we can kind of cut our losses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Becky, I think you've pretty much answered my basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| I certainly agree that it is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| that we're going to get this house back in productive use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| back to being part of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| as opposed to possibly detracting from one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| In terms of lessons learned, is there some way that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| I mean, we held this house for three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| You said we've marketed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| I guess we acquired it in January of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| just when the world was falling apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| in terms of real estate markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| So you sort of explained how desperate that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| Do you have any thoughts of how you might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I mean, rent it or get someone in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| so it at least doesn't get kind of scavenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| by someone who's looking for copper or materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| to steal from the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| Right. The property has been secured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| as far as the doors and windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Their windows aren't broken out or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| People did get into the crawl space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| We're trying some different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| to actually board up some of our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| to make them look like they're occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| So there are ways that we can try to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| to at least kind of stave off any vandalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| And maybe sell them at a slightly lower price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| just to get them back in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| That's what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Yeah, we're here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Yes, right, after three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| I appreciate what you're doing. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Ms. Wade, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| In my district, the properties adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| are they occupied or are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| There are some rental properties right around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| I think one is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| There's some that are occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Yeah, this is at the end of Washington Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| on the east side of Cherry Street at the dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| I see. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Well, the chair will entertain a motion on 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| to execute an agreement with Volunteer Ministry Center, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| to provide $25,000 in emergency shelter grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| for the operation of a day resource center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| for homeless persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Yeah, I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| I don't know who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Maybe it's Becky again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| There's some timetables in the text of the basic agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| and one of them is sort of half expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| It says from July 1 to September 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| place 20 individuals into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| How are we going to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| since we're starting in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Yeah, our grant actually began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| our annual year begins July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Our funds are retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| With the fiscal year, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Yes, our funds are retroactive to July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| So costs incurred after July 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| can be recouped from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| So that's why that's structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| What if they don't meet that goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Those are goals that we hope will be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| We break them down in quarters like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| but really we look at it as an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| So if one quarter isn't met, it really doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| because we can make it up in the next or on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| We require quarterly reports from all our sub-recipients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| and that's their goal to try to meet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| through their reporting to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| All right, it's been moved, and Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6250)|
| 1:44:10| I didn't know whether Ms. Weatherstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| would like to make any comments to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| in terms of where we are on the housing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| Jenny Weatherstone, 9025 Candlewood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| I guess the thing that I would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| with respect to numbers is that we do set goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| We are year-to-date, and I am talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| starting January 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| We have assisted 77 individuals into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| And so perhaps that will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| Councilman Della Volpe's question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| I'm still getting a number of telephone calls on MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| How are we on that as far as occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| MinnVilla, as of last evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| let me tell you that there were 40 apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| with residents in residence at MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| There are two lease signings that will be either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| by the end of this week or the very beginning of next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| with 11 or 12 applications in process right behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| The capacity is 57, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| so when these next two leases are signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| and the vouchers are in place and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| we will be at 75% capacity and moving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6334)|

| 1:47:35| for a new contract total of $752,379.35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| and to extend the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Yeah, if we could just have a short explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| I've read through this and I do understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| but I think it'd be good that we go on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| as to why this change order is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6472)|
| 1:48:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Sounds like Mr. King, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Mr. King, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| The predominant increase in costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| is because KUB decided to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| the sanitary sewer line in Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| and they had included the utility work in our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| So that necessitated that we bring that to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| to authorize that expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| The additional, I think it's $23,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| all relates to installing a special events box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| and getting some overhead utilities underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| as they cross between the two churches in the 600 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| And there will be some landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| that will need to be added to beautify the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| around the special events box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| I just wanted my colleagues to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| in fact, we're excited about what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| at that end of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| And I think we're going to have our entire Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| finished, you know, in the next year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| Well, if there are no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| Can we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Then moved and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| to accept a quote from Brown and Brown of Tennessee Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| for property flood and earthquake insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| and boiler and machinery insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| for an annual premium in the amount of $178,294.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Then moved and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Mr. Mayor, I had the light on, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Yeah, I just, I guess Mr. Martin isn't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| but I guess one of the reasons for the increase in premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| is that we had storm loss and fire loss at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| And so we're actually experiencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| we're paying for that increased experience on this renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| Is that correct, Mr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| If you're answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| I believe that's correct, but Mr. East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| this is here if you need further elaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| but that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Yes, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| I believe it's been moved and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6615)|

| 1:50:19| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| 11I is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| to execute an amendment to agreement number CO80144| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| with Cowan Benefit Services, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| for increased oversight and monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| of the city's pharmacy benefit management program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| and other city health programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| using specialized software for data analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| at an estimated additional cost of $97,900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| for the first year and $49,900 annually thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Been moved and Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| Again, for our citizens that are trying to pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| to what we're doing up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| there is an increase in this particular contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| but the idea is to better manage our pharmaceutical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| and other benefits under the health plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| and they hope to save,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| they estimate between 100 and 300,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| so the savings will exceed the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| It's another example, I think, of good management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| on the part of your staff and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| and it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6681)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| I would just briefly like to take this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| since Mr. Eastus is here to publicly recognize him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| and his leadership in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| The city of Knoxville and Mr. Eastus individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| have been recognized in a national publication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| for our innovative approach to healthcare and to prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| and this is just another example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| of an incredibly innovative approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| that I think will not only serve our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| and the people that work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| but also save the taxpayers dollars going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| So, healthier outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| better investment of taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| it's a win-win all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6717)|

| 1:53:28| about why this representation with federal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| in Washington is important to us and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| 11M is a resolution respectfully requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| that the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| or other such appropriate officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| at the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| initiate an amendment to Article V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| Section 10, Subsection A7 of the Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| as well as any other necessary provision of that code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| so as to reduce the maximum height of any ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| or monument sign from 50 feet to 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| We touched on this earlier when we were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| at the appeal at the Sherrill Hill development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| and I certainly support an overhaul in our sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| I'm a little bit concerned that we might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| to use a more surgical approach in how we do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| and I'm thinking of city interchanges like Merchant Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| where it's primarily an interstate corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| and there might be a need and with the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| of the surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| even be aesthetically appropriate to have signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| ground signs that are taller than 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| I'm not a sign expert and maybe we already have provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| for pole signs that are different from ground signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| and so that would cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| But I'm wondering if we want to talk about broadening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| this resolution at all to encompass a broader look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| at our sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| That being said, I know during the budget season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| we expressed some real concern about the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| that MPC has to take on these enormous projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| and an overhaul of the sign code is four words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| but probably years and months of staff time and of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| So I'm a little bit torn on how to vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| because I'm not sure I'm comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| with reducing our sign height by 50% from 50 to 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| particularly if a more surgical approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| given the needs of different districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| commercial districts in our city might be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| But I'm also cognizant of budget restraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| in trying to really look at a coordinated approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| in revising all of our signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| So I'd like to defer to the resolution sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6953)|
| 1:55:53| Thank you, Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| I appreciate your comments and I do think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| when we talk about the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| it's a little bit different than in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| and into the countryside and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| when I made the, asked for the resolution, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| I thought more about areas like Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| and more of the flatter areas throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| you know, when it pertains to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| But as we send this back to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| for review and recommendation and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| I would ask that they do take Councilman Roddy's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| into consideration because those are valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| There are, you know, hills and valleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| and so one sign's height doesn't fit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| So I agree with that and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| And so I don't know if the verbal request to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| Mr. Donaldson, is efficient or, I mean, necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| if that goes far enough or if we need to amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| in some way, Mr. Swanson, to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| our intent, which is to lower the clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| and the signage down to where we can take advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| of our scenery and natural beauties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| and ridges and mountains and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Mr. Swanson, was that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| I appreciate that and if you expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| a simple recommendation from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| I'm greatly disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| We will take a broad view of this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| and try to place it in context with the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| as a whole as well as some of the prevailing themes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| that we're seeing across the country and across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| as far as sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| Okay, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| And furthermore, I really think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| to hopefully move this forward and also begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| to consider the entire sign issue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| So, and I know a number of us have talked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| in the past, so in the coming weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| I hope to come forward with more resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| to try to remedy what we all believe needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| All right, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| This is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Whoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| Councilwoman Roddy talked about a budget issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| that we discussed and the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| that MPC will spend on different things we ask MPC to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| I probably should have given you a little heads up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| How long are we talking about as far as man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| woman, person hours to bring this task forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| I got wind of this resolution a week ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| and I've already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| We probably won't have it on our September meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| but we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Well, I'm not asking for a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| I'm just asking, you know, is this gonna take 200 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| of MPC time, 20 hours, 500, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| just I'm looking for a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| No, this is probably, in Mr. Becker's vernacular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| a small to medium-sized task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| And that would be how many hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| We might devote a week of my time to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| All right, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| Mark, I know that when Councilman Becker was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| that we had talked about trying to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| a group of interested folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| And I know that in the last two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| dealing with the sign issue that I've dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| that there are a group of people who'd be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| in getting together and discussing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| I don't know how you want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| or whether Vice Mayor Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| whether or not we want to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| and put together a group of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| who would like to look at the entire sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| But I know there are those people that would be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| So I know I personally also would like to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| and take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| But I'm not sure what the pleasure of the Council might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| I don't know, Joe, I'm not sure how you are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| that you might have some other resolutions coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| But I do know that in reviewing the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| and when we talked about this, what, Peter, nine months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| we had talked about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| of putting together a group of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| I don't know how you feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7240)|
| 2:00:40| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| And as we proceed along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| I intend to put some resolutions together to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| And you could feel free to do the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| to communicate with him on something similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| along the lines of what you feel needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Because my view, we've spent endless hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| in my seven years now on City Council talking about signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| And we've had committees, we've had task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| we've had reports, we've had everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| And we just debated it to nauseam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| and we never got anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| I think if we come one by one and take these issues up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| one by one, that we can have a good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| and come to some conclusion, send it to the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| for reforming it, come back and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| But I've just decided that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| that's the cleanest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| The more you bring into this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| the more diluted all the issues become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| and the less effective we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| So, and the other thing is, do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| in terms of knowing that this potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7310)|
| 2:01:56| resolution's coming forward, this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| do we think that there'll be a number of people rushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| to try to clear, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| to go after the 50 foot current height restriction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| Mr. Donaldson, do you think that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| some type of moratorium would be necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| Or, I mean, how do we prevent sort of a race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| to that at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| The only way to prevent it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| to place some sort of moratorium on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| Right now, the development activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| is not particularly robust, so there probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| aren't a lot of projects in the pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| that are even thinking about new signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| So, in that sense, it's probably a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| to be looking at changes to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7367)|
| 2:02:47| But there may be one or two, who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| Well, Mayor, that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| I think a lot of us have sat through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| these specific particular sign issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| and feel free to move forward as I intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| All right, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| Yeah, I applaud Vice Mayor Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| And, you know, I think tonight was a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| I don't want to say starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| but it was a really good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| There was great arguments on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| of the issue for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| And, you know, you probably could have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| either way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| But I think that we did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| I know we did the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| because it has to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| And we've talked about this for forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| And I hope that we wouldn't let cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| I mean, we can't throw money up in the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| but let me say this, the longer we wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| the more it's going to cost us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| because people come to East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| and to Tennessee because it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| And we made a huge step tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| because we kept it, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| you know, coming from Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| where they have good signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| You know, we preserved an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| and we made a real good move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| And so, you know, we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| with good legislation and really start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| to decrease the visual pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| that we have here in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| And it's in all parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| So, you know, we've got to consider cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| I understand we've got budgets to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| but the longer we wait, the more it costs us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| All right, thank you, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| Yes, I'm in favor of going ahead immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| with Vice Mayor Bailey's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7476)|
| 2:04:42| I think I heard the consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| that everybody thinks 50 feet is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| And the longer that we leave that out there on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| the more problems we may have similar tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| But I did understand the frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| of the developers here who came here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| thinking that they had that ceiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| that they could work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| I think we made the right decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| But even though the motion before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| is not going to solve the sign issue in entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| I think we need to go ahead and pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| so we can at least start working with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| And Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| I agree also that I think we should go ahead and pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| But as many of you know, I just told Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| you know, I dream about signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| And so if it's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| what I'd like to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| there are a group of people who would like to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| and look at the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| And what I'd like to do is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| and put that group together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| and at least come back with some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| that those folks have, if that's appropriate on that, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| And if there is no objection from Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| I would like to recognize Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| I think you wanted to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7555)|
| 2:06:04| I'll be brief because it sounds like there'll be lots of more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| lots of, lots more time to be able to comment on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| But I want to say thank you so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| Vice Mayor Bailey, for bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| I think that Councilman Grieve and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| have stated so well tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| that this is about what we want our city to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| And this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| And as I said, we live in a beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| We could and should have a beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| I just want to say something else about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| which I think relates to this evening's issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| with the Cheryl Hill development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| Businesses don't choose a city to locate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| because of the allowable sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| I just don't believe that that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| What they do is they do a market analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| and they look at the economic activity of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| and they determine whether they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| the area can support their business or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| All businesses, whether they will admit it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| and they won't admit it up front, have a plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| You heard Ms. Klein say that she saw the very same businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| in other communities with lower signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| That means they are willing to put up lower signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| and still locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| And I'm sure everybody here has been to Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| You've been to the Biltmore development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| You've all seen the beautiful McDonald's that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| Why don't we have McDonald's that look like that here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| It's a matter of design and zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| We could have it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| They're willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| They tell you they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| They say they won't locate here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| unless they can put up their big, ugly signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| and their big, ugly golden arches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| And I'm just using McDonald's as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| but it's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| They all have a plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| If they think your community can support them economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| they're going to locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Oh, and I just want to say that I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| that we'll have more time to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| but something has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| Be done about the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| as I said, has a very long history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7680)|
