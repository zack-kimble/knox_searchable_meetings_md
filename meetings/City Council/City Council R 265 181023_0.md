| 0:03:00| For the Mayor's Report, first I want to remind everyone that it is time to go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| Early voting is going on right now for the November 6th state and federal election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| and it will continue through Thursday, November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| So you still have about eight days left where the polls are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| We encourage you to do it now and get it behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| There are no City of Knoxville offices that are on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| but you're voting for our state lawmakers, a governor, U.S. House of Representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| and our U.S. Senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| To find out the hours and locations for early voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| either visit knoxcounty.org slash election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| or you can call the Knox County Election Commission at 215-2480.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| I'm happy to report that both the Police Department and Fire Departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| have a training academy underway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| The police class, the KPD class, began its police academy training last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| and KFD class just got underway yesterday, and there are 34 members in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| It's a big class for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Meanwhile, we are also currently accepting applications for the next police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| For this next class, we are also allowing lateral entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Have we ever done that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| It's been some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| We have not done a lateral program prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| No, this is something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| This is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| We know we need to build back up to our numbers that we have certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| and so we are allowing lateral entry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| which means that if you are a current officer from another agency who is post-certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| and has at least three years' experience, then you can apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| And if selected, then you will go through a short or modified academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| in order to become a police officer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| So we encourage folks to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| And to learn about that, go to knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| And the deadline to submit an application is 4.30 p.m. on Friday, November 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Coming up this week and next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| we will be celebrating the great work of some of our officers and firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| in addition to paying tribute to our fallen firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Council members, I hope you'll be able to join me at each of these three events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| and any of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Tomorrow, KPD will announce its Officer of the Month honorees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=314)|

| 0:05:23| Howard Baker Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| So that's tomorrow at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Then on Thursday, October 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| the Fire Department's annual Fallen Fighters Memorial Service will be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| at 1130 a.m. at Firefighter Memorial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| which is in front of the downtown fire station on Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| We will remember and honor the 12 city firefighter retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| who have passed away in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| as well as remembering the 24 city firefighters who lost their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| in the line of duty dating back to 1876| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| when the department began as a volunteer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Again, the Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service will be at 1130 a.m. this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| at the downtown fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Then next Monday, October 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| the Fire Department will announce its Firefighter of the Quarter Award honoree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| at the fire training facility on Vice Mayor Jack Sharp Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| That'll be at 4 o'clock, so everyone's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| I also want to encourage everyone to attend the next series of public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| for the Recode Knoxville Zoning Code update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| This is the first thorough review, you've heard us say this many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| of city zoning in nearly 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| and the new code that comes out of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| will serve as our blueprint going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| for protecting and enhancing Knoxville's sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| The more people who weigh in and share their thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| tell us what their priorities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| then the better and more comprehensive that blueprint will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Our aim is to strike the right balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| between protecting the unique and historic characteristics of our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| while creating standards that encourage quality growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| with affordability and appropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| So community outreach for Recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| began really about a year and a half ago, back in May of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| and we're closing in on our 60th community meeting on Recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| and more than 750 comments have been received and evaluated by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| To read all the comments or get details on the evolving draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| you can go to RecodeKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| So a proposed ordinance will be presented to MPC next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| and after that, council will begin its consideration of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Your input is greatly valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| The third draft of the proposed code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| and second draft of the proposed zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| is being presented at the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| and city and MPC staff will discuss changes that were made from the last round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| So here are five public meetings that are scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=473)|

| 0:15:36| is that the two sides have been working together, and you have, based on the letter I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| that was signed by both sides, if you want to come down, Ronnie and Kevin. And so my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| understanding is you all will jointly present what you agree with, and then we'll deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| the issue and do the normal process of each side stating their position on number 8 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| you don't agree on. Is that acceptable to both of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| We think, yeah, I guess the best way to state it is we have agreed on conditions 1 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| 7 as being appropriate conditions for the use on review. Mr. Collins, our client, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| Murphy, the appellants, Mr. Collins et al., think there should be an 8th condition, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=978)|

| 0:16:33| Okay, so we're going to hear on that one, but you both agree, and on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| you both agree, you all agree from 1 through 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=999)|

| 0:16:45| Okay, so now, unless you have anything to say before we start from the neighborhood side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| then we'll go ahead and hear from each. And we start with the appellants. So, Mr. Collins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1010)|

| 0:17:00| And as you know, you have up to 5 minutes, and so if you'll watch the timer, then I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| have to interrupt you. I appreciate that. So go ahead and state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Ronnie Collins, 4606 Washington Park. President, Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1028)|
| 0:17:17| Madam Mayor, Vice Mayor, councilpersons, we'd like to thank you for your indulgence in giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| us several weeks to work on some of our concerns on this matter. We thank Maddox Companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| and their council, Arthur Seymour, for their assistance. We also want to especially thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Jim Hagerman from City Engineering, Mike Reynolds with MPC, and Rob Frost, your council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| and Jim Snowden and Aaron Fritz with Knox County Engineering for going above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| in working with all parties in this matter. We have reached agreement on seven conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| which have been provided to you. However, we have been unable to reach agreement on perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| the most important issue, stormwater management and related flooding. The biggest expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| to taxpayers for not getting this right is the problem of making current flood zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| worse, creating additional flood zones. We're not asking to stop this development. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1092)|
| 0:18:21| we are asking for are enhanced stormwater controls to ensure that this development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| an asset and not a liability to the community. This development drains to Murphy Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| then White's Creek, then First Creek. There is already significant flooding at the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| locations. Upstream on White's Creek at Tazewell Pike and Fountain Gate. Downstream on White's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| Creek at Beverly Road, which causes water to back up over Oakwood Drive. First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| and Walker Boulevard, Emberlin, Fairmont, and Oakwood Lincoln Park neighborhoods where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| the city has already spent millions of dollars. And at First Creek where the project to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| the Granger Avenue Bridge is costing nearly $1.9 million. We, the appellants, have suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| an eighth condition to implement increased stormwater management practices that we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| will help existing flooding issues downstream. Engineering has the authority to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| that this development impacts areas of known flooding and must implement stormwater retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| practices. We request that you, City Council, consider this as well and determine if placing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| a condition on the use on the review is required. We ask you to consider these questions. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| will the impact be of increased water volume discharged from this site? Is this discharging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| into an area of known flooding? What are the public safety and welfare risks from known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| flooding and potentially new flooding? How much money the city has already spent on flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| and will have to spend in the future? Finally, will White's Creek and Beverly Road, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| White's Creek and Beverly Road require work due to the impact of this development? At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| the end, we request that you amend the action of MPC so that the approval is subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| the agreed on conditions and also the stormwater management condition if you deem that necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you. Thank you, sir. My understanding you're just going to have the one speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| but the rest of you will be available to answer questions. All right. Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Now, Mr. Seymour, who will be representing your site? Mr. Campbell, our engineer, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| then I'll speak very briefly and Steve Maddox is here for questions. Okay. Mr. Campbell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| please state your name and address for the record. You have up to five minutes and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| you'll watch the timer. Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane, and I am the design engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| on the project and, again, I'll echo some of Mr. Collins' comments. I think the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| has been good and hopefully leads us to make better design decisions as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| on this project. What the opposition is asking us to do is basically take a section from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| the code, 22.5-32, section E, which are requirements for developments draining to a sinkhole. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1289)|
| 0:21:39| not requirements for development draining to a positive storm channel such as a creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| or a wet weather conveyance. And some may say, well, that's sinkhole wet weather. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| difference does that make? Sinkholes typically drain to an underground, underwater body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| whereas detention requirements drain to a creek or a positive water drainage feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| Typically, a creek or a wet weather conveyance is capable of handling a certain amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| flow. Two to five year storms are a rule of thumb. We understand there's flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| We see the pictures and understand that. However, this development will be under the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1333)|
| 0:22:24| that you put forth in section 22-5-31, design standards for detention basins, which allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| for positive drainage to a body of water. We believe that the city has an extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| tight set of regulations. It's been well vetted. It's not been just vetted by the city, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| those are standards that are used across many jurisdictions to minimize the impact of stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| It's almost, I don't want to say it's impossible, it's very difficult to take a set of standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| for a sinkhole and you're basically moving a section from a section of code into another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| section and trying to make that work. I'm sure if I went through all the code of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| city of Knoxville, I could find a sentence or two that I could move into a code that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| would probably say no detention is required. But there's a reason you put these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| in order. There's a reason you put those under certain headings so that we are able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| your criteria and your guidelines. I understand the desire and everyone thinks that detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| excuse me, retention, which is basically creating a lake on site that doesn't exit your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| because it would in theory go in the ground, but we can't confirm that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| There are no sinkholes on the property that would feed into the ground. I've got a lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| upstream from my property. It's probably five or six acres. I live on a creek. That creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| still floods. So retention does not guarantee any minimization of flooding. If a lake were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| the answer at this piece of property, then I would submit that the city would have bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| this piece of property a while back, made it into a lake and fixed all the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| problems downstream. But there's no magic bullet. One of the areas of flooding on Tazewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Pike is about 125 to 150 acres that's undetained coming on to Tazewell Pike. That was a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| that was made 20, 30 years ago when that was being developed. So we strongly object. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| object because we believe your stormwater ordinance is extremely tight and will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| the desired impact for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Thank you, sir. Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Mayor, members of council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Hold on. Let's get the timer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Do I need to start over or am I okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| No, you're okay. We think we know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| This appeal involves a use on review. At the August meeting of MPC, the MPC, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1505)|
| 0:25:17| planning commission, approved two items. One is what is called a concept plan. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| a plan that would ultimately result in the subdivision of the property. The appeal from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| that plan is to the Knox County Chancery Court. The appellants here have advised us that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| will not be appealing that. The other part, and the part that is before you, is the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| on review, and that is appealed under the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| city council, and that's what we're here about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Now, the concept plan, basically you're talking about the same development. You're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| talking about subdividing property. You're talking about how you're going to do your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| lots and the engineering. The concept plan requires that Mr. Maddox and his company meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1561)|
| 0:26:12| all applicable requirements of the Knoxville Department of Engineering. One of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| requirements is enforcement of the stormwater ordinance. The city of Knoxville has a stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| ordinance, which I think was adopted four or five years ago. I may be wrong, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| considered by my clients a very stringent ordinance. I think by other people it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| considered a model ordinance. The requirements are very strict, according to most developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1598)|
| 0:26:47| It is administered by Mr. Hagerman's department, the city of Knoxville Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| Engineering. The stormwater ordinance has different categories on how you handle stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| Essentially, what the appellants are asking you tonight to do is sort of rewrite that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| ordinance. We're going to take this section here that they have raised the issue about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| and although it may not apply or does not apply to the Maddox property or the Maddox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| development, we want you to apply it to that. Section 22.5-32 for ND. They say, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1643)|
| 0:27:35| we're going to move that section over, and for this particular piece of property, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| going to direct the Department of Engineering to impose the requirements there on Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| Maddox's property. So in effect, you're being asked to rewrite the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| The director of engineering and his staff make decisions about the administration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| the stormwater ordinance. If this appeal is ended tonight, what happens is Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1685)|
| 0:28:15| will go to work and really go to work and start spending money coming up with a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| plan that will deal with a number of issues, stormwater, roads, layout of lots, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1702)|
| 0:28:32| and that will be submitted to the Department of Engineering, and at that point, the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| of Engineering will take your ordinance, decide how it applies, if Mr. Campbell's engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| has complied with the ordinance, or if it doesn't, in what ways it does not comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| the ordinance, and here, Mr. Campbell, they will send Mr. Campbell a list of things he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| needs to do. What we're asking you to do tonight as the appellees here is do not rewrite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| the stormwater ordinance on the fly at the request of Mr. Collins and apply it simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| to one piece of property here in the city. We're asking you to leave the stormwater ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| alone, let the Department of Engineering administer it as it is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| In the end, I would like to thank Mr. Collins, Mr. Murphy. We've had very good meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| and we've called on Mr. Hagerman, we've called on Mr. Green, we've called on Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Who else have we called on? We've called on various people to assist us with resolving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| the issues, and I'm happy we got one through seven resolved. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you. I do have to say it's impressive to get this letter where you both signed one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| through seven and then clearly delineate what the differences are, so thank you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| the neighborhood and to Mr. Maddox for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Okay, now, who else? Mr. Maddox, did you want him to speak now, too? Mr. Maddox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| If he wants to, and he may want to since his name's on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Mr. Maddox, please state your name and address for the record, and if you'd watch the timer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| I'm Steve Maddox. I've been a resident here my whole life. My address is 101 Dalton Placeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| Knoxville 37912. I don't really have any further comments, but I'm available for any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| that anyone may have. The only other thing I would say is that I've been in this business for 35 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| and have developed numerous stormwater retention ponds as part of developments in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1838)|
| 0:30:49| and they have all held up and have never had a single violation on any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| so I think that that stands as a pretty good example of what will happen here. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you, sir. And now the appellants get an opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| Do you wish for that? No? Okay. Okay, you've waived your two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| Okay, so now it's open. Thank you, Mr. Maddox, and if Council has questions, they'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| I would like to ask Mr. Hagerman in engineering a few questions about some of the requests that were being asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| I would like to start off by saying I appreciate everybody working and spending, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| up to three meetings together from multiple different departments at MPC, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| and from the developers and from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| I wish that those lengthy discussions had happened before it was passed through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| and maybe we could have avoided a few things, but I appreciate how far things got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Hagerman, when an application like this goes to MPC, developer submits, it goes through your department, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1920)|
| 0:32:11| And you guys make recommendations for conditions upon that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Jim Hagerman, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| We don't really get all that actively involved in it until there's actual plans to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| and that's after the concept plan is approved, so we did get pulled into this one fairly early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1945)|
| 0:32:36| I mean, the concept is fairly well advanced, so we do have some useful input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and a general idea of what the direction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| So this being my district and most of the areas that were submitted to us as areas that flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| some of which I've seen myself, some of which in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| can you kind of help us understand why we have all that flooding and where it comes from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| I believe in the last year or so, First Creek Greenway, the pictures that were submitted to us, flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| It was suggested in commentary a few minutes ago that the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| the current stormwater standards we have were adopted just four to five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| so how did they change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| How much more stringent did they get if they're, quote, unquote, a model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| How did we change them, and how did that impact the majority of the existing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| that is out there versus what happens in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| That's a lot of questions to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| I'm not sure where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| As far as flooding in general in First Creek, there's a little complicating factor in all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| and that was that most of the construction within the city was before there was any regulation of floodplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| So there are a lot of structures, businesses, and residences that are within the geomorphological floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2040)|
| 0:34:12| that has flooded forever, and so that's sort of a baseline issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2052)|
| 0:34:22| On top of that, there is development upstream that has increased the amount of runoff to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2062)|
| 0:34:32| Within the last, really, our stormwater ordinance has been evolving for the last 20 years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| and a lot of the current regulations as far as detention are more like 15 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| So in the last decade, decade and a half, the retention requirements have been in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2089)|
| 0:35:00| and we feel they've been very effective in stemming any increase in flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| And, of course, talking about baselines, there has been historical flooding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2109)|
| 0:35:19| Did that answer all of your questions? I've lost track a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Sorry. Well, there's a sense from a lot of the neighborhoods that the flooding increased over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| but your sense is that it's maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| I guess we know that some of the neighborhoods are built in floodplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| We know the Broadway Shopping Center is in a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| We know the First Creek Greenway was a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| That's where we had a lot of low-income housing that was torn down by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| because it was continually flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| So we still have areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| We've spent a lot of money at Emerald and Fairmont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| We still have areas to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I know recently areas flooded at First Creek, and this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| So are there ways that we can increase that by putting different requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| If it wasn't this summer, it was in the last 12 to 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| There was one of those pictures, though it said 2016 maybe on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| I've been down there and driven around where that whole greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| which is no longer housing for that reason, has flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So, you know, we had flooding at Prosser Road, and the city addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| We had flooding at Emerald and Fairmont, and that was where the Pizza Hut was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| and we addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| So how do we deal as a city, how do we deal with the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| and how do we feel that this development is going to impact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| or any additional impact or development upstream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Well, because of the historic nature of the, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| because there is a lot of buildings that have been there for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| and existing flooding issues, even without any increase from upstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| the only way to decrease flooding is to do major capital projects in the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| We do have a list of plans that we're – a list of projects that we're working through slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| We have one bridge that we're working on right now that has an effect on flooding adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| The next one is Mineral Springs Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| We don't have anything specific queued up after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| but that kind of uses up those sources of funding for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| We have done – I mean, we've bought up properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We built the bypass channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| There's several other little issues, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| In addition, anything that gets redeveloped gets redeveloped to modern standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| So a lot of the commercial property in Fountain City, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| that flooded in, I think it was, 98, is no longer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| and it's built up so that the developed floor –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| it's redeveloped so that the floor elevation is a higher legal elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| And next time that happens, it won't get flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| The road will flood. The buildings won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| That's our main focus in this sort of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| So we have a lot of programs in place to prevent further issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| prevent somebody from rebuilding in a place that's just going to flood again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| And our policies and programs are recognized by a pretty strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| flood insurance premium rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| And as far as upstream development goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| as long as they follow the city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| I am confident that there will be no further increase in flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| So your department will look at this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and we have an ordinance that says this is how we're going to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| the water runoff from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| And as long as it meets that standard that's in our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| you feel that it's not impacting down – it's not contributing to downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| It's not increasing flows downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| So what we're being asked for in this eighth condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| that was not agreed upon in the many meetings you guys all worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| was to apply a higher standard than what our ordinance –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| you were looking at this plan in our ordinance as to say detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| versus the appellants are asking us for us to apply the standard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| a different standard or different retention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Right. And I would say that it's not a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| It's just a – it's a different standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| that's not really appropriate for this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| So can you explain to me why detention versus retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Well, retention is very useful in a situation where the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| is draining to a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| A sinkhole has a certain amount of storage and usually slow discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| So it's not peak flows that make it flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| Because once it's full, any more – any more water will just spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| and flood the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| On the other hand, a stream – and Mr. Campbell pretty much said this already –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| a stream is governed by peak flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| The amount of – the extent of flooding in the stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| peak flow just makes it spread out farther and higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| So if you can control that peak flow, you control the severity of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| And the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| The detention pond does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And it is – the city ordinance requires same before and after development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2467)|
| 0:41:15| flows up to 100-year discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| And our design process is quite conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| So nearly always we over-control at the higher – at the higher levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| So one of the things that I'm going to ask Mr. –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| I'm going to ask you, Mr. Hageman, the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| the ordinance we have determines the size and the number of the detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| So the amount –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| The hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Yeah, the amount of flow determines the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| But, yeah, the ordinance – the ordinance requires a certain flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| That flow determines how much detention is required on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| So I'm going to ask Mr. Maddox, when there was the public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| you mentioned that you were willing to do detention ponds that were bigger than required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| So I would like to know what you mean by that when you said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| and would you commit to doing that so that it held more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| and met a higher standard than what engineering minimum –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| the minimum standard or the gold standard that our ordinance requires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| I ask Mr. Campbell to take the area that is designated for the detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2551)|
| 0:42:40| and the size and everything that's required to meet the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| and then with all of the available space to expand the size of those ponds as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| to further slow the flow, I think would be the correct term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| and to use it in – use the available property where the ponds were going to be for that to maximize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2577)|
| 0:43:08| The only thing I would have to say about the request that has been added regarding the sinkhose, that's a lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2588)|
| 0:43:18| and so then that would be using even much more property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| and would really hamper the development and wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| But if we stuck with detention ponds that engineering is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| based on our ordinance and our stormwater standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| and you said that you would build them bigger than what they required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| Yes. What I'm saying is there's an area that's designated for detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| And so what I asked Mr. Campbell to do was to, in that area that's designated for detention ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| to use every bit of the area that's usable for detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| In other words, if you can make them five or ten or whatever percent larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| then I will pay that difference, I think, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Let me answer your question a little bit, and we've done a lot of the design on the detention ponds already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| Basically what we are doing is reducing the peak flow rates beyond what the ordinance requires us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2658)|
| 0:44:28| The ordinance requires that we meet or decrease the allowable flow rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| from a pre-developed to a post-developed condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Currently what our calculations are showing is that we are reducing the peak flow rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| below that level somewhere between 20 and 50 percent from a total flow rate coming off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| I can't give you a final number because we've not finished all the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| but we did move forward with a lot of the detention pond information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| so that we could look at that and have a little bit of a feel for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| So Mr. Maddox, what he promised you that he would reduce, it's a factor of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| It's a factor of the opening that you meter the water out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| It's a factor of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| It's a factor of all kinds of different things that you use in detention pond design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| to take that peak flow rate from here down to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| And we've been able to do that so far in our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| So what he told you is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| So I don't want you to think it's just making it bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Making it bigger is a factor, but it's not the only factor that takes your peak flow rates down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| Okay, I think maybe your words were you would design them to a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| You would go above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| I think it's a 20% to 50%-ish below what the allowable is currently in our design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| and we commit to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| We're at least at 20%, and we'll probably be way below that when we finalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| I'm just wondering if we can meet in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| and then I'll defer and let my colleagues ask questions, at least one of the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| Did you guys discuss this aspect in those statements in your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| your possibility of us meeting in the middle and making some commitment to go above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2774)|
| 0:46:24| and stick with the detention pond rather than retention pond, but meet a higher standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| And I think that lowering the flow rate significantly from the standard is somewhere in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| Retention, remember, doesn't allow any water to leave the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I mean, it goes in the ground at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| So we are, there is no, you either let a little bit of water out or you keep it all on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| and so we're trying to let less water out, and we feel that is somewhere in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| Retention is a zero outflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| It's a zero flow, and I don't know how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| I don't know what that middle ground is other than to take our flow rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| and reduce them significantly like we've committed to doing from what the city allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| between a pre and post, and I'm trying to explain some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| that I didn't do very well in calculus anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| so trying to explain those are getting a little backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| But anyway, I think we are meeting in the middle by reducing that peak flow rate significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| But that's not something that's agreed to or conditioned in writing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| No, because they're, yes, ma'am, sorry, their request was zero outflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| The request is a zero outflow with the retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| And that was, we volunteered that we were going to be 20 to something percent below in some of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| If my memory serves me correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| And that's not the condition that they chose to ask us to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| But if we move forward without a condition, that's just a verbal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| It's not a commitment that we can stick with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| I guess that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I mean, if you want to put it as a commitment, I'm on tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| We're going to be 20 to 40 percent or 50 percent, and we'll put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| But on the peak flow rate, I mean, that's so far what our conditions have, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| our engineering has led us to believe so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| So then I guess my question is, would you agree to that 20 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| I just did, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| I thought I just did, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| So if we put that as a condition...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| So 20 percent from the pre- and post-developed peak flow rate reduction from where it's at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| for a total peak flow rate, then we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| And that's something that we can design to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| That's something that can be administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| That's something that can be checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| That's something that can be using your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| That's a measurable item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| If you take the zero retention, there are all kinds of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| So once that sinkhole or that area gets filled, what happens if it rains again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| Where does that water go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| It goes undetained somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| It goes unregulated somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Once you fill up a swimming pool and it continues to rain, that water's got to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| If we can't get it into the ground, which I don't know that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| I mean, we've not drilled in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| We don't know if there's a positive way to get in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| That could create a much worse situation for us down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| because once that gets full, if it rains again on top of that, that goes somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| It goes downstream and it's unregulated and unmitigated, whatever the right phrase is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| I'm going to let Councilwoman McKenzie ask her question before I continue for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| A lot of the questions that I had, Councilwoman Ryder asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| but Mr. Hagelman, I just want points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Did I hear you correctly to say that this is an existing known flood zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| And so with the current regulations and standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| did you say that this particular development would not contribute negatively any additional volume to the flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3025)|
| 0:50:34| It will not contribute additional peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| It will not increase peaks downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| And Mr. Campbell is saying it might even decrease peaks downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| although it's a very small contributor to the whole watershed, but it's a good practice to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3045)|
| 0:50:55| And did I understand you correctly to say that you would do additional analysis once they submit their plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| We'll check their calculations and make sure that everything makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| We won't do additional calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| We depend on the proposer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| He'll supply a plan stamped by Mr. Campbell as an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| and his professional life is on the line if he tries to pull something over on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3080)|
| 0:51:31| So we trust stamped plans for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| We also verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Trust but verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| So you're the checks and balance just to make sure that they're doing it within the specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| And if you were to see something that you felt was not within that parameter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| you would go back with recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Usually in most cases where we have a big set of fancy plans, I mean complicated plans, we'll have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3112)|
| 0:52:05| There will be two or three rounds before they meet all our requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| That's normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Could I ask Mr. Murphy and Mr. Collins if they would address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3138)|
| 0:52:28| and answer if we could get an agreement to do the detention pond requirement 20% more than what's required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3148)|
| 0:52:38| If we could go 20% above what they just spoke of before Councilwoman McKenzie was questioning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3158)|
| 0:52:46| could we meet in the middle on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| This is Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| So this is the first time a numerical value has ever been presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| so we haven't had an opportunity to actually try and understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| We've been told that probably their preliminary designs could probably be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| So I'd like a second to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| I mean certainly that's an improvement, being able to reduce the peak flow discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| There's always still the issue of peak total volume discharge, which is where retention handles it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3198)|
| 0:53:27| which is also, I know, a concern that we have because the longer that stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| that flow is going at a particular rate, the flooding doesn't go down as quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| Your volume levels stay up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| So that is the other thing that hasn't been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| We haven't talked a lot about peak flow, but we haven't talked about the total volume of discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| But 20% is definitely an improvement, so that's better than zero and would be seen, I think, favorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3227)|
| 0:53:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| I'm not exactly sure who to address this question to, perhaps Mr. Maddox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| but once the development is complete, and let's say we go with detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| who is responsible for maintaining that, those detention ponds, and how are they maintained long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| It will be part of the property owners' association of the subdivision and the board that's set up for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3262)|
| 0:54:31| and they will have dues and all that help to take care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| We've set up numerous ones of those in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3276)|
| 0:54:49| Correct me, Jim, but under the city ordinance, your detention facilities grant easement to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3289)|
| 0:55:00| so the city can come in if the HOA, homeowners' association, does not maintain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| They can correct them and put them in on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Mr. Hagerman, does this issue essentially come down to detention versus retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| and do you have a recommendation on which one makes more sense for this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Is that essentially what we're discussing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| That is my understanding of what the appellants are asking for is retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| and I think retention is less effective at protecting downstream properties from flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| because, as Mr. Campbell mentioned, once it fills up, there's no storage available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| It will drain down very slowly, the retention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| and a second storm may completely overwhelm what little capacity is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3365)|
| 0:56:17| On the other hand, the detention pond does drain down relatively quickly, up to 72 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| and it will have some capacity to absorb the next storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| It's really just the wrong standard to apply to the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| Detention is the appropriate approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| Mr. Murphy or Mr. Collins, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Is that the way you see the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| and do you have an explanation of why you think retention is preferable to detention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| James McMillan, 4715 McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| No, the issue is discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Developments come in, impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| you create a tremendous surplus of water that was never there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3426)|
| 0:57:16| In the flyer or the thing we sent out, you can see the schematic on their detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| More water comes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| It comes faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| It comes sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| That's why, as the watershed fills up, the five-year rain event becomes the 50-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3449)|
| 0:57:38| You're discharging more volume of water into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| That is where retention comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| It's a higher standard for development to control discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| They can discharge in the ordinance up to the pre-developmental flow rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| It's not a zero, and it's a higher standard to protect the whole watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3479)|
| 0:58:08| and the future cost of fixing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3497)|
| 0:58:31| Are there examples where we've done detention ponds instead of retention ponds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| Detention is our standard practice throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| except for a few watersheds that drain to sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| That is our tool for sinkhole watersheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| You guys are saying there is no sinkhole to drain to here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| Right, so a different standard should apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Mr. Hageman, would an extra 20% in the detention ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3541)|
| 0:59:12| if they were built 20% to contain or address 20% more than our standard requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| would that help what's flowing to the watershed and what other impacts there are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| I think it would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Overbuilt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Yeah, I think it would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3570)|
| 0:59:40| It would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I wish that all developers could do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| but from our perspective, we have a standard that we apply to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3585)|
| 0:59:56| and try to be fair with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Adding another 20% is a nice thing, and if they're willing to do that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| If Mr. Maddox is voluntarily willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| I would like to capture that and make the motion that we apply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| I feel like we're in a situation here where we are being asked to change the philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| or question the philosophy of our stormwater management and how we address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| I do want to clarify with you, Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| A few minutes ago in the beginning of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| you said to me some of our remediation for building in floodplains in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| parts of my neighborhood, parts of things along Broadway are in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| They were built up 80 to 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| We all, those who are here from the area, we want to stay in our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| in spite of the fact that they weren't built with the best flood practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| And so are you saying that some of the remediation that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| is for the streets to flood rather than the buildings to flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Did I misunderstand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Some of the remediation that's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| well, when I said the street would flood but the buildings won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| I was referring to the floor elevation standards that have been exercised in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| They're raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| So it's one way of avoiding flood damage with new development or redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| Not existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| It's just following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| The new rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| But as far as the remediation work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| the bypass at Emeryland, Furman Emeryland, did lower the flood elevation some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3700)|
| 1:01:51| so it took some pressure off of houses that were built in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Some of the other work that is long-term proposed can have some of that same impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3715)|
| 1:02:04| but there's nothing else at this time that's planned or funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| The bridge work that we're doing now does have some beneficial effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| on adjacent properties, particularly upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| And, of course, those bridges got built about the same time the rest of the buildings got built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| so they're not to any particular flood standard either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| So we go back and fix those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| It does help some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| So we will probably be doing projects like that for the next 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3758)|
| 1:02:47| and so we will slowly improve the situation throughout the watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| Mr. Maddox and Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| So if you're on the record and willing to agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| I'm willing to make a motion to amend and make a condition for 20% above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| Make sure that, again, the words are important here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| It's a 20% peak flow rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| because that's the standard we're going to be measured by is the flow rate coming out of those ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| not necessarily the size of the ponds, but the peak flow rate of that pond being 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| which is the standard that is used in your ordinance to determine success or failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| 20% less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| 20% less, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Less than required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Yes, 20% less peak flow rate than is required by ordinance, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| And just let me add, I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| I was just trying to describe it in layman's terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| but it does need to be put in the correct terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| That's the reason we have these professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Although tonight I feel like we've all just gotten continuing education credits and retention, detention, peak flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| But I don't feel like we've got enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Let's do it for eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I've had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| But we'll talk as long as we want to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you, Mr. Hagerman, for your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| I'm ready to make the motion, Lauren, if you want to make it to accept the seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| and if you want to add that on there to amend the motion to increase the flow rate, then let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| So I think the motion, if you want to define what eight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| I have that number eight would be that they would build to 20% less peak flow rate than required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3878)|
| 1:04:49| It might be a better way to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| And then if that's number eight, then the motion, if this is what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| would be to amend the use on review to adopt conditions one through eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| as are defined here and just now stated into the record, 20% less peak flow rate than required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Mr. Hagerman, is that how you would word it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| I would be good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| In terms of enforcement or application, trust but verify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| It would be verified in the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| But that is an understandable criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Mr. Murphy, Mr. Collins, I understand this isn't exactly what you asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| but I feel that this is a reasonable request given the ordinance that we have on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| And I feel like some of the challenge that we have in District 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| are things that aren't in our control that are not within city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| So I'll interject that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| A 20% reduction in peak flow rate post-development is definitely a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| So we appreciate that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| We appreciate the developers offering that this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| That's a smart thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| You're also, I think, very correct, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| A lot of the water that comes down to you is from outside of the city and coming from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| and that's where, as that section develops further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| there's going to be a need for probably some more dialogue between city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| to try and address the discharges coming off those sites as they develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| Including the one that just got a sold sign on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Although my farm's not getting developed, so we're going to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| So I'll make a motion to amend the USARM review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| to adopt the agreement for Conditions 1 through 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| and for Condition 8 for a decrease of 20% in peak flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| Did I say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| An additional 20% decrease in peak flow via detention ponds as recommended by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4023)|
| 1:07:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| 20% less peak flow rate than required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Is that the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| 20% less peak flow rate than required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| That's the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4051)|

| 1:07:35| And now we need to go back and approve the USARM review as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| I need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| I'll make a motion to approve the USARM review as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4066)|

| 1:10:16| The first is Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| Mr. Hayes, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| As you know, we've got the clock up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| If you'd please watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| 312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| First, I want to say shout-out to the CAT bus drivers who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| I'm proud to be sitting with them, and I'm proud to support them in their struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| Yeah, shout-out to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Shout-out to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| And as we know, the struggles of working class and poor people interrelate a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| So, you know, I'm not a bus driver, but I still see that as my struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| And I'm not homeless, but I still see homeless folks as my comrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| and people I need to speak up for and empower when I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| All right, let's get into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| So instead of talking to the folks underneath the bridge, you know, Magnolia, Broadway area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4270)|
| 1:11:21| and empowering them to have a say in the resources they need and receive from city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| y'all have decided to push through your own agenda and project without consulting the people you claim to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4288)|
| 1:11:38| So as a result, you have increased criminalization and disregarded democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| Today, we've seen only $30,000 go to community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| Shout-out to Stan. I know Stan's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| And Seed. It's cool seeing y'all get $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Y'all deserve that money. Y'all work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| But that's only $30,000, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| And that's compared to the $170,000 we're seeing going to the security firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| with little to no community input in this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Community groups in the budget barely get over a million dollars as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| In this almost $400 million budget, community organizations, which serve our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| barely get over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| So instead of valuable resources going directly to houseless folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| the city will spend $1 million over six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| almost more than all community organizations combined in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| That money and this resolution will further criminalize folks for existing too close to the so-called safe space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4358)|
| 1:12:47| We shouldn't prioritize your agenda, your projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| and the private police corporation over people who need resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| People in poverty are constantly criminalized, constantly targeted by law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| and constantly we are seeing the state and governments find ways to put us in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| Courts are full of homeless folks every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Any morning you go down there and you look at the docket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| you see who's sitting down, you see who's in change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| you see a large amount of homeless folks of all different colors, all different races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4398)|
| 1:13:27| More needs to be done to help and empower these houseless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Instead of criminalizing people and kicking people out of their shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| the city should be involving homeless folks in the decisions that affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4416)|
| 1:13:47| The city should commit to giving access and resources to people who need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| without disrupting and wrecking people's lives like you did yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4432)|
| 1:14:01| You all said support homeless folks, yes, without criminalizing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| and give them a voice in your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| You should also support the Homeless Bill of Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| which is something that's come up repeatedly in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| which is not too much, which is not special rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| No, it's just about giving people compassion, caring about people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| and wanting to see them do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| When folks like that come together and present something like a Homeless Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| that outlines things that will help their lives, you should look at that seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| and not just disregard it and call them ants and insects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| like the former city councilman, Della Volpe, did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| And last of all, you should support our cast bus drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| and you support city workers, but especially these folks and their struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| And I hope every single one of you all will pledge your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| and make sure these folks get what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| And now Carolyn Roecliffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4498)|
| 1:15:09| Thank you, ma'am, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| and if you'd watch the timer, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Carolyn Roecliffe, 1216 Raintree Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| I would also like to clarify that I misspoke to Will Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| I'm against the safe space that you guys are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| I'm frustrated with my city, and to be more specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| I'm absolutely disgusted with my city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| On Monday, October 22nd, I watched our houseless neighbors being evicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| from the encampment on Broadway between Raise and Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| I also watched our houseless neighbors get charged with criminal trespassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| from sleeping, sleeping on a sidewalk, sleeping on the sidewalk, criminal trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| That's a hell of a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Excuse my language, but I'm absolutely disgusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| And by creating this daytime park, you're displacing hundreds of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| hundreds of people without shelter this winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| By building it and completing it, you're displacing people at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| for this so-called daytime when you see the most concentrated people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| down under the bridge at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| So where are all these people going to go to sleep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| This encampment of people has been demonized by the city and continues to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| We saw it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| I've seen it a couple times this past month during these raids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| these clean-outs where KPD will literally show up and just throw people's things away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4598)|
| 1:16:47| when in reality these are the most marginalized people in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| in this city, providing mutual aid to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| The eviction that I watched take place on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| and that has been happening this past month again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| are nothing more than an attack on the most marginalized people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| So to end with that, gentrification ain't cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| And it's insane and disgusting to me that we need to legalize sleeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| Counsel, so what's before you here is the security contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| And let me just give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Did you want to ask a question first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| I was just going to ask if you or Becky Wade or the police chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| wanted to address some of the concerns that were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| I'll ask Mr. Brace to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| Or Michael Dunthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Let me just say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I didn't see Michael Dunthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Where's Michael?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Hey, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| So let me just update counsel on what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| As you all know, a number of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| we amended the budget to create some new additional programs to try and address the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| and help the folks who were there on Broadway under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| And part of that program was to create the day space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| and allow individuals to be there during the daytime with access to water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| with restrooms, with full-time security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| and a paved area that will have benches and picnic tables and such for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| In the meantime, also, as we were getting ready and working with TDOT to make that space available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| we allocated funding to volunteer ministry center, and two outreach workers were hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4714)|
| 1:18:42| They have been working daily with folks there who are under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| and have been talking to them, helping them access services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| And as well as CARM has outreach workers, CAC has outreach workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and our own Officer Clinton actually, you know, the social workers know the individuals by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| They meet with them daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| We work with them to try and help them access the resources that are in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| We also allocated funding to try and help the sex workers who are in the community as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| and Helen Ross McNabb Center as a social worker has been reaching out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| and helping these women get the resources they need and be able to move into a safer life situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4765)|
| 1:19:33| We have what's called CHAMP, which is a Coordinated Housing Assessment and Match Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| which is a multi-agency coordinated intake assessment and referral system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| So these agencies meet on a weekly basis to talk about individuals who are seeking housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| trying to get off the street, seeking housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| and it prioritizes their needs and tries to help connect them with the right agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| so they can, in fact, become sheltered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| One of the things that was interesting that happened, we got an email from Burt Rosen actually on Monday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| the day that we officially began the relocation, and they started cleaning up the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| By the way, the individuals who had been staying there were told, again, weeks in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| and they collected what they wanted and took it with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| knowing that what was left behind would be cleaned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| We had this message from Burt Rosen saying that he was pleased to report that outreach efforts of his staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| and, of course, the other staff that I've mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| have resulted, just their staff, in some 70 to 80 conversations with individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| and 49 of them so far that night had started coming inside to spend the night with them and discuss next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| So we are seeing that for some people, knowing that they would not be able to stay there overnight any longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4858)|
| 1:21:07| are now choosing to come in and receive the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| There are services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| There is capacity at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| I know that good and reasonable people disagree in the community about how best to handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| but you're not the only ones with compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| We have worked on this issue for many years with the individuals, with the service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| and our responsibility and our goal is to help connect people with the resources that are in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4890)|
| 1:21:40| There is capacity at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| There are multiple resources, and we continue to invest in that to try and help these individuals get back on their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| you know, to get back into housing and to find jobs and to be able to be in a more stable environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4909)|
| 1:21:58| So that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| I think we're doing the right thing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| There's some other programs that are in the works that we're not ready to announce yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| to try and help address this population and their needs, but this is the contract before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| is the contract for the security guards to try and keep people safe there during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4938)|
| 1:22:29| and that will go into effect once the site is prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Is there anything else, Mike Dunthorne, that you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| Or David Brace or Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| I will add just very quickly, it is important to know that security is all about security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| and safety for the individuals who the citizens that are marginalized in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| that are challenged in that area, to help protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| As the design was done for that space, KPD and the social workers did reach out to the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| that congregate and utilize that area in safety, water, some type of restroom facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| Those were the needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Phone charging, so we did receive feedback from individuals in that area through our relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| It's about providing some basic restrooms, potable water where you can wash your hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| where you can have drinking water, a surface that right now it's a gravel surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| so many of those individuals have accessibility issues, so it's hard to get into and out of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| So a paved surface with seating during that day use was another request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| And so that's really what it's about is security for the people that occupy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| health and safety and cleanliness, restrooms and potable water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| those basic things that many of us take for granted, providing that in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| So the security is really, it's not about arresting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| it's about keeping the predators that do tend to congregate in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| and, again, prey on those individuals that are in that area and are challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| And so that's what the security is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| And these other measures are really based on many of the requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| and feedback we've received from the homeless in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| All I would add to that is, Mike Donthorn, Office on Homelessness for the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| all I would add to that is when we went through the RFP process to select the security firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| we made it very clear, and we've talked to Vinson folks since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| that what we want is folks to keep an eye on the place, keep the day space safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| but to operate in a compassionate and respectful way towards the folks in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| And so their objective is going to be just to simply keep folks safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| If something gets out of hand or whatever, they're going to contact the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| and so the police department will deal with policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| These folks are just going to kind of keep an eye on the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| Mayor, one other very quick comment for Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| We do have to routinely clean the area because of sanitation, health and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| human waste and litter and garbage and food waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| We do have a notice system that KPD and the social workers use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| We understand that the valuables that these individuals have need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| We want to protect and respect that, so we give notification to those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| Before the cleaning, there were weeks of notification before this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| And, again, that cleaning is really done just to keep the most basic health and safety in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| and notification is part of that and has been for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| I just want to ask, so the hours of the area and the times that the Vinson service will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| will there also be, is it the same time the social workers will be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| The guard service will be there to open it up and close it in the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| and to be there in the interim during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| We're working with CARM to try to make sure we set those hours in a way that, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| won't undermine the services they're offering across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| and also any way we can coordinate with that to make sure that our opening and closing times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| work with the services that really is where we want people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| And so, yeah, they'll open it and have it there during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| and social workers will be able to come in during the day and work with folks who come to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| But it's not a matter of the social workers will be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| The social workers are contracted to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| That's their purpose, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| That's their job to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| So they're there simultaneously working in partnership to address the root cause problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| such as lack of access to health care, signing up for benefits, connecting into programs and housing, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| And not just those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Other agencies like CARM who has outreach workers that can walk across the street, CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| other groups have outreach workers that also will be invited there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| to make sure that the full range of services are offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| The volunteer ministry center social workers that the mayor referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| are specialized in dealing with this particular population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| They've been at it for a number of weeks already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| and they say that when they go down to the area, actually people will start coming to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| because word's out that they're the real deal and that they're there to help folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| And so they've been doing a lot of good work already engaging with folks in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| And actually what Bruce Fangler said at our recent roundtable meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| was that a lot of folks that are there, they welcome the social workers because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| we have said in the past, and there are some people that are resistant to services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| because of their particular situation, but there are plenty of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| that still don't know how to access them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| And so we're going to them, helping them understand how to access services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| and we're seeing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| We're seeing people respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| And I just want to say in my having gone down there at different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| I see people who are abusing other folks down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| and so I think it's important to make sure that there's somebody to protect those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| that are being victimized by folks that may have a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| and just come down there to take advantage of the folks that have not gotten into services yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5303)|
| 1:28:31| But I do want to say it's been a while since some of these senior council members here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| and folks that were the predecessors of the new folks had done tours of CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| because neighborhood leadership, neighbors from the near neighborhoods were included on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| and I think that that would be warranted because I do have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| and would like to see what has changed at those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| I'm getting reports from constituents that even though we are told that there is availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| and there are beds, there are homeless individuals that insist that they can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| that they're turned away, not just for drug use or other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| So I would like for council to we've had the homeless providers come give us a tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| or presentation at a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| We've talked to them at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| I'd like to go tour the facilities and see what's changed and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Yeah, we'll be glad to arrange that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Mayor, did you want to mention about if folks want to help, some of the best ways they could help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| I know we've had some issues with people dropping off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| One of the things we've talked about is that there are many well-meaning people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| who bring blankets and food and tents and this and that down to the place there under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| And what's happened is that there's more items brought that people can even use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| And so when it's time to clean the space and people are told ahead of time that the space will be cleaned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| a lot of times they leave it behind because it becomes filthy dirty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| and then they move on and all this stuff gets cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| We're encouraging people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| We want individuals who are homeless to seek services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| And so if those who have the heart and the compassion to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| we encourage you to link up directly with CARM and VMC and Salvation Army and CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| and all of those organizations that every single day have programs that these individuals can access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| So we encourage people to work with existing organizations and not just do it on your own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| because, in essence, that's how we connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| We encourage people to connect to the resources so they can improve the situation that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5439)|
| 1:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| There's no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5450)|

| 1:32:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Mr. Bill, we've talked about this a little bit, but a couple lingering questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| A lot has changed in this development agreement since the original RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| From what this, Dover won this on the merits of the plan he submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| which is a lot different than what's coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| and there's been a lot of discussion about that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Talk a little bit about that, how we got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| and I'm assuming we have the authority to accept that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| even though it's quite a bit different than what originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| a number of units, a number of hotels, and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Yes, this has, I would say, evolved over a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| and of course we had a number of proposals and we chose one to begin negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| and of course a lot of preliminary work is done at that time by developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| but until they get in and start spending some money and working on the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| and dealing with the economy at that time, particularly the hotel economy, things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| And in this case, the site dictated a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| I think the apartment complex part is kept largely the same in terms of scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| We have kept the insistence that we address Henley with a live streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| We also have added some requirements in terms of the other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| What has changed the most has been the original hotel proposal, as you noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| So now we have a, the good news is they're going to be able to keep the old State Supreme Court building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| which of course environmentally is very sound from a sustainability point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| and utilize it, but that will amount to a much smaller hotel footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and that's largely a function of the fact that, as I think many of you have noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| since the original RFP was issued, we've had a very large influx of new hotel investment into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| and that's continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| We're about to have in the next number of months a couple more open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Both the Marriott will be opening around the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| and then by the middle of next year the Embassy Suites will, and of course we have the Hyatt Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| So that has changed the hotel environment, which evolves continually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| and we've been in regular discussions with Mr. Dover and Mr. Carlisle about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| Also in terms of the impact of hotel world and their need to try to meet, come up with something that worked effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| and of course secondarily from the city's point of view, we don't have, we're adding hotel rooms, not as many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| but we're meeting that need in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| Now we continually have kept with purchasing and law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| and we all believe we are still within the spirit of and a good bit of the letter of the original proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5737)|
| 1:35:45| We are comfortable that we are still in the parameters within we were negotiating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| But you're right, it has switched quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| It's changed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| So one of those is that we've split the site into two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| And that's a little bit, I mean, so we have, but it's the same developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| So the development that's doing the apartments and doing the hotels, the same partners are in both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| So we're not going to have to deal with two different partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| It's still one partner, one, but two different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Has that been part of the reasons why we had to extend some of the previous amendment, to extend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| Yes, and because really we need to proceed separately because there's a lot more certainty in the hotel world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| and we want them, not the project to be able to begin immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| and also the parking and the way it's arrayed and the way the parcels are defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| this made it work a lot better to have separate parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| but basically one project that together meets the entire needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| We're talking about the same development team in both cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| I think that's real important, that it's the same development team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| It's not different partners on the two different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| So there's quite a bit of language in here in this development agreement, the rider aversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Explain why that's in there and really what your strategy was to come up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5821)|
| 1:37:11| We may get it back if this happens or that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| Why do we have that in there and why do we need it in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| Why would we want it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| That's really the key question I'm glad you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| The situation we are in when we confront a project like this is we actually purchased this project from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| The reason we did that was because we wanted to have some control over its outcome under this key parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| The state of Tennessee can only just auction properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| They can't do RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| In doing so, in purchasing that and then putting our own request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| we wanted to ensure to the greatest degree possible the outcomes that were proposed actually occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| and that's why we need to have some teeth in that if the developer varies from that very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| or doesn't perform, there are some remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| On the other hand, we are being made whole on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| It will be in private hands, and we've got to structure this agreement such that they are not constrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| to where they can't get their banks to support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| and their project would be at risk at any time of being taken back by the city in an unreasonable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| So we spent months going back and forth, and I would defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| We have Mr. Mametoff here who worked with us and, of course, Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| and people on our legal team trying to get that delicate balance where they were able to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| and we were able to retain some degree of certainty that this project would go ahead as we wanted it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and that's why we had to build in things like some reversion rights and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| if, in fact, the project didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| Now, we did discuss yesterday the idea of, well, maybe if everything fell apart, we wouldn't want it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5929)|
| 1:38:57| and that reversion is optional to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| I mean, in a sense, the city is made whole as soon as this purchase is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| We're not out anything, and we think we have real good certainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| both on the record of both of our major developers here and also in the language we have in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| that we'll be able to have, I think, sufficient certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| to be at minimal risk that this project will occur as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| And that was the strategy behind it, to make sure that it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Once they're 20 percent in, their reversion option is then satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| And we're off the hook of having to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| But I don't believe we have to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| It's an option for us to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| I think that is something that I learned subsequent to our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| And the development will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| I mean, the hotel will proceed faster than or quicker or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| I could basically defer to most Mr. Dover and Mr. Carlisle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| if you wanted to talk more to what your schedule plan was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| That might be of more utility at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Rick Dover, 4921 Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| Yes, we feel like the existing building could be begun much, much quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| There's environmental issues that have to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| There's about $600,000 worth of asbestos mold and lead paint in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| That will come out first, demo of the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| So we can, candidly, I'll be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| my company will be doing the general contracting on the hotel parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| We'd love to get started really before the apartment starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| so that we can use the parking lot for lay down for materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| and parking our workmen and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| So, yeah, we feel like we could begin rather quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| certainly within 45 days, probably within 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| I'll just need to pull a permit and we can start tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| Twenty percent may come pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| We may all be taken up by the work being done on the hotel part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Well, the hotel budget is $12.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| It's total, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| I mean, it's the total of the total projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| not just each individual project, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| You've got 20 percent in on the total, not just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| I think it's the lesser of $5 million or 20 percent of the total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| The total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| The total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| So combine the hotel and the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Mr. Mabentoff says it's not separate projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| It's separate projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Twenty percent of the separate projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Twenty percent of each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| That makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| That gives you more options in the event that you needed to exercise your rescission right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| you know, one versus another, you'd have that option, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| We're going to make sure that doesn't happen, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| I hope that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| I believe that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| That's really all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| I mean, I know you all have done a lot of work on it to get it to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| and I see that in talking with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| That might be the understatement of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Well, people keep asking, well, why are you extending it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| And, I mean, these are the type of questions that I get, and I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| And I see the reason behind the strategy of these in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6134)|
| 1:42:22| and I guess I'm glad to know that clarification that it's on each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| I'd like to ask Director York to come down real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| And while he's coming down, just wanted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| talk about the footprint of this particular site is obviously very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| and the redevelopment is obviously very important, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| just in a sense of where we're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| But there is another reason why development in this particular area is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| that I thought Director York might help us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| One question, again, Councilmember Roberto and I have discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| relates to what we call the Tourism Development Zone, or the TDZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| And that is an area where the city is able to capture a portion of the state sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6193)|
| 1:43:25| and the local sales tax to be used to repay debt service on the convention center facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6205)|
| 1:43:35| So, for example, last year the Tourism Development Zone money was around $7.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| and we can use that to basically help pay for debt on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| The annual debt on that convention center is roughly $10.6 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| So, again, you can see the TDZ is an important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| The other thing that is used to pay for debt on the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| is a dedicated city hotel motel tax of 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| Again, that's sizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| At this point in time, and again, it has not always been this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| but currently we have three sources of revenue, the tourism, the TDZ money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6256)|
| 1:44:24| the city hotel motel tax, and then a portion of the county hotel motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| that is more than sufficient to pay for the debt service on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| And currently we do not use any property tax money to pay for debt service on the convention center facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6277)|
| 1:44:48| I hope that answers your question, but I'm available for any further questions if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| Yeah, that does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| That's what I really wanted to get into is that redevelopment and development in this particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| really has an added bonus of really helping pay down the debt for the convention center faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6302)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| I also want to call on Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I just want to make clear that Councilman Singh-Perez is unable to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| but she raised an important issue in her discussions with Mr. Dover and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| utilizing minority and women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| We, along with Councilman Singh-Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| appreciate your volunteering to use your best efforts to meet or surpass the goal of 10% of your subs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| being from minority and women-owned firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| just as you did with the Hyatt Place project, and I know you exceeded that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| We appreciate those efforts, and I know Councilman Singh-Perez does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| Okay, so is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| 11H is the resolution to amend, resolution number R-250-2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| which authorized the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| to negotiate and accept from Orange-Knoxville-Cumberland LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| payments in lieu of Avalorum taxes with respect to property located at 2223 Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| so as to clarify language outlined in the pilot lease defining the project and uses of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| This question is for Ms. Foster, and it's actually really not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| It's just I want confirmation that this is a pilot that was previously approved by Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| and then at our last meeting we voted basically to approve an administrative change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| because there's an ownership restructuring for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| The new owners have looked at the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| and they realized that the business allowed in the retail space was very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| It was a CVS, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| So they have asked to open that up and say really pretty much any equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| and legal retail business could operate in that commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| That's what we're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director and Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| During the September 25th meeting, we did come to Council with an amendment to the pilot lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| to add a new partnering entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| There was some language in there that talked about the use of the ground floor retail as a CVS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| and other language was inadvertently omitted to clarify that legal use as a retail space on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6457)|
| 1:47:48| So we're just cleaning that up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| So I just want to be clear that this is not specific to CVS because I am an employee of CVS Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| and if it is specific to CVS Health, I'd have to recuse myself from voting, so it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| That language is being removed and clarified so that it could be opened up for any retail space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| that could legally operate in the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| I just want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Thank you for checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| 11-I is a resolution to amend Resolution No. R-364-2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| which authorized the Industrial and Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| to negotiate and accept from the Gallery Group, LLC, payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| with respect to property located at 36 Market Square, 320 Wall Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| so as to expand the use of the lease premises to allow for any commercial use on the upper floors of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6524)|
| 1:48:55| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6536)|

| 1:49:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| So we are now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| Thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Council, we actually have seven people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Typically, we start reducing times if it's more than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| But four of them are here from CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| And if there's no objection, I'd like to let each of them go ahead and speak up to their five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| And we'll start with the four individuals from CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| And in this order, Ventress Hodge, Melissa Stooksbury, Glenn Kerkorkian, and David Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6569)|
| 1:49:36| And as you're coming forward to the podium, I do want to say and just remind Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| and also those that are here that the city of Knoxville is not the entity that directly negotiates with the union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6581)|
| 1:49:55| with the Amalgamated Transit Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| By state law, municipalities are not allowed to sign union contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| No city in Tennessee can sign a union contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| So the way many years ago this was worked out legally was that an entity called K-Trans Management was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6607)|
| 1:50:16| and the officers of K-Trans Management were basically the senior management of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6616)|
| 1:50:23| And all employees of CAT are actually employees of K-Trans Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6623)|
| 1:50:31| I'm going to ask the law director to correct me if I say anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| So K-Trans Management is who signs, negotiates, and signs a contract with Amalgamated Transit Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6634)|
| 1:50:42| We are required by law to have an arm's length from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| because we are not allowed to negotiate with unions per state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| It's not my law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| So we are glad to have you here tonight and to talk about the situation, the contract negotiations right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| But I just wanted people to understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| that I cannot personally, nor can my administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| personally intervene in the contract negotiations because of state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| and basically the anti-union provisions of state law, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| So we'll start with Ventress Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And each of you, if you want to come forward, I ask that you please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| And let me also add that we appreciate our CAT employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| We appreciate the service that you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| Do you want to pass something out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| Okay, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Somebody can grab those for you if you want to go ahead and start to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6689)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| Okay, so please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| And if you please watch the time, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Okay, well, my name is Ventress Hodge, and I am a driver for Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| I also am the vice president of our local ATU 1164.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6713)|
| 1:52:02| Once again, I want to say thank you for allowing me to stand here and express my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| I'm also frustrated because we are working without a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| As you can see, there is a lot of CAT workers here with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| We have members of ATU, and we have non-members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| This contract affects all of us, and CAT is refusing to give us an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6745)|
| 1:52:38| They say that we are delaying the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Well, we have to read 43 pages of their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6761)|
| 1:52:51| They have moved paragraphs in the proposal, so it's kind of like a catch-me-if-you-can type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6771)|
| 1:52:59| We have had to put their proposals together and read it word for word, period for period, question mark for question mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6779)|
| 1:53:10| When we first started this out, we gave dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| They said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| We offered weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| We even worked on Memorial Day to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| Myself and some of the other officers on the team ended up starting negotiations at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6803)|
| 1:53:32| We didn't leave until 1130 at night just going through their proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6812)|
| 1:53:39| Ever since we've been doing this, their lawyer has talked down on us like we can't comprehend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6819)|
| 1:53:47| They are aware that we are a new executive board, and we do have help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| and I give shout-outs to our MVP that is helping us with our negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| They are wanting to put a lot of language in this contract to me that I feel like they do not need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6841)|
| 1:54:11| One of the things that they want to put in the contract is that if someone gets fired from CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6851)|
| 1:54:19| they have the ability to say what they are supposed to do when they get fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| If I get fired from a job, it is not their business to tell me what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6865)|
| 1:54:35| The list goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| They blame us for not wanting to get this done when in reality it's really them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6878)|
| 1:54:50| I'm going to stop, and I'm going to pass the buck because what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| we have other members that can fill in the rest of what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| I hope that you all read those examples that I have passed out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| because that is part of our frustration as far as what they're wanting to put in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6910)|
| 1:55:19| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| In person is Melissa Stooksberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| My name is Melissa Stooksberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| My address is 7656 Trey Oak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I am a bus operator as well for CAT and the recording secretary for our local union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6940)|
| 1:55:49| Well, first of all, I'd like to say I've been employed with CAT for 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| and this is the first time that in the years that I've worked there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| that we've not been able to settle a contract, and it's brought some real concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6959)|
| 1:56:10| We've always been able to negotiate and been able to get somewhere with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| but we just can't seem to do it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| Some of the things that they want to implement into the contract is already in their 41-page handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6980)|
| 1:56:32| that has rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| and one of the concerns that we have is that they have quit paying progression raises to our employees that are due their raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=6995)|
| 1:56:51| Like I said, she explained that we have filed for an extension and they have yet denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| so we're just hoping to be able to get somewhere with our negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| It's very frustrating, and that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| Thank you very much, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| Now, Glen Kirkorian, did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| Oh, I did. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| Thank you for being here, and please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| and the timer will show you your five minutes, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7047)|
| 1:57:35| My name's Glen Kirkorian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| I live at 9320 Alder Gateway, apartment 5104 in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7057)|
| 1:57:45| I'm addressing all of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| I'm the financial secretary for this union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| and while we understand that you all can't intervene in any of the negotiations that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7071)|
| 1:58:01| everything that goes on with this city involves transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7081)|
| 1:58:10| We're not at a point yet where we're going to have a strike vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7090)|
| 1:58:18| I want you to hear me very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| If transportation stops, picket lines will go up at the Magnolia office and the downtown office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7101)|
| 1:58:32| and no one will cross the picket line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| We're 90% strong now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| We want you to hear us clearly that transportation affects all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7119)|
| 1:58:48| Your phones will literally blow up if these people can't get to where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| You hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| So I need for you all to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| What I'm going to speak about that really personally grinds me to a halt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| we have an attorney who is very condescending, rude, and vituperative when dealing with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7148)|
| 1:59:19| and he works or represents, excuse me, Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| We're over dealing with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| We're not going to be told that we need to eat our vegetables first before we get to the entree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7168)|
| 1:59:36| and this is in relation to our asking for the financials of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| We wanted to resolve this back in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| but we get these really condescending, rude comments from the attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7187)|
| 1:59:55| and we want you to know we don't have to put up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| We want to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| We want to get it over with, and we need all of you to take this very, very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7203)|
| 2:00:11| because whether you can get involved in it or not, it will impact the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7211)|
| 2:00:18| And Mayor, you've been in our offices many times. We love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| But we need for somebody to get on the bandwagon and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| you better get it together. We can't have our transportation stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| David Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| Big word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Sir, please name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| David Webb, 422 Dry Valley Road. That's Philadelphia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| I am the shop steward for CAT, and I'm the mechanic in the shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7261)|
| 2:01:11| And what we're asking the company was for an extension on the contract you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| I've been here for 12 years. We've always had an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| For the purpose of the company guarantees 40 hours, and the workers guarantee come to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7282)|
| 2:01:31| And we know, like, you can't do anything you said you couldn't personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| but maybe you can talk with them and help them understand, hey, we need to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| They're basically trying to put a policy book into our contract, and it's never been that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7306)|
| 2:01:55| Our contract is for our union members to let them know what they need to give back to the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7315)|
| 2:02:04| And that's all we're asking them to do, respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| I'm going to go ahead and read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Sorry, I got ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| In July, I asked for a contract extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| In June, I asked for a contract extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| This is the letter that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| So thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7352)|
| 2:02:40| All the folks from CAT, I believe, isn't that right, have signed up already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Thank you all very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Next we'll hear from Ms. Vivian Shipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| You know the routine, Ms. Shipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Name and address for the record, and please watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| Vivian Underwood Shipe, 2340 East Magnolia, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| I want to speak to you about the weather alert we are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| You see, when there is impending danger, the weather stations issue an alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| I'm here to tell you that there is impending danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| We are reaching a crisis state in the area of affordable housing in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| We have spent millions of dollars to develop housing to draw people to Knoxville, condos and lofts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| lofts, new development everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| But the people who live here need housing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| We need all kinds of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| We are learning of these different faces at the town hall meetings we are holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| These faces include housing needs for the singles, the elderly, the aged-out youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| We need emergency housing, recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| We need the RN-3 and RN-4 housing, mixed-use housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| And, yes, we need housing for those swept from under the bridge yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| A person needs a base to operate from, a place to sleep, to bathe, to eat and to feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| It's raining in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| There is a need to understand who needs the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| We must understand that those who are homeless in this city have specific needs and cannot be lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| Indeed, even those served by the homeless roundtable have different faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| and I submit to you that there are faces missing at this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| The table is not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| And rule must be made for those who are not being represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| and rule must be made and funds must be made available for more of the different organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| who have been for years quietly making inroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Invite us to your homeless roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| We who represent the voices of this city invite representatives of people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| the elderly and the abused, the immigrants, the mentally ill who are stabilized now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| and can tell of their success and how their needs are not being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| Invite those working with the refugees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| Invite the working poor and the working homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| You need to add new and diverse faith-based organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| Add people like Tyler Trotter and Rico Hopewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| who are working with the ever-growing number of citizens in this city who are addicted to opiates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| Bring to the table people like Ira Grimes, who is helping people one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| Bring Connect Ministries to your table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| This year alone, since January of 2018, Connect Ministries has helped over 700 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| Seven hundred people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| The workers in the field know it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| Ask people like Denny Kidd to the table who can share with you how they're helping the sex trafficking victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| Bring your investors and your small developers and realtors in so they can listen and see through fresh eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7538)|
| 2:05:46| It's raining and there is danger ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| Hear this alert, for Knoxville is likened to the Titanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| She is beautiful and she is growing, and everybody wants to get on board from all over this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7554)|
| 2:06:01| The problem of the breeze that was swept out yesterday was but the tip of a massive iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| Look below the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| People see the gigantic problem of affordable housing for citizens is what threatens to rip this city apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| We must think and do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| I ask you to look at what's being done in other cities and do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| Rethink how you're using property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| Partner with new entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| I ask you to look with your spiritual eyes and open your ears and hearts to the people and act in a new and bold way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| Finally, I ask you to open the coffers of this city that currently hold millions of dollars collecting interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7590)|
| 2:06:37| The surplus, the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Those millions belong to the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| They represent his talents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| He has placed those talents in your hands until his return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| Don't leave them buried in the bank collecting interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| We are his stewards and we are not helping his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| It's time to spend some of that rainy day money on the people of Knoxville who are getting drenched with the same urgency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7615)|
| 2:07:02| and priority as we have placed in building and developing spaces for new faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7622)|
| 2:07:10| This is an alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| It's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7631)|
| 2:07:18| Now Josh Smizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| Please state your name and address for the record, sir, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| Josh Smizer, 1424 Cornelia 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| I actually live around the street from Councilperson Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| So I'm here today as a bus rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| I just want to shout out the Route 11, Route 22, and the wonderful service I received as a bus rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| I'm also here as the co-chair of a group called Jobs with Justice of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| which is a labor community and faith coalition representing thousands of people in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| who care about social and economic justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| And so I was really called to speak today to you all about the issue that you've just heard a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| and I want to come at it from a little different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| As an organization, we believe that every single worker has the right to negotiate their working conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| pay and benefits, that the whole community, the whole community meaning the people in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| the people in this county and the state and the country, benefit when workers are treated well and paid decently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| The CAT bus drivers are an essential providing accessible transportation to Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| who really need quality public transportation, and as we've heard earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| quality housing and many other things that are sometimes not available in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| The CAT drivers proved that they are able to provide that quality public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| and that by refusing to bargain in good faith with ATU, that not only hurts those dedicated public servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| who, while not directly employed by the city, in fact serve the city as public servants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| that hurts the provision of quality transportation to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| And so I believe and we as an organization believe that petty policies, our refusal to negotiate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| and what really could be seen as union busting hurt not only the union and the workers that are made up that union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| but also hurt this whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| I also believe that this is a racial and economic justice issue that really calls this council to pay attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| and that the mayor and the council can have a real and direct and positive influence on the course of this negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7767)|
| 2:09:36| while not being in the room necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| And I just want to say lastly that our organization representing those thousands of people will stand with the ATU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| as they fight for the dignity and the respect that they deserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| and that will ultimately benefit the folks in this room and the folks in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7794)|
| 2:10:01| Jobs with Justice has been around many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| I know 38 years ago when I moved here, I think that's when maybe the predecessor of that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7805)|
| 2:10:13| and Jim Sessions who was here was a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Keith Britt, 558 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| This is draft three of the Knoxville Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| You'll be getting a copy of that very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| In all likelihood, the path forward for this is they'll have a few community meetings next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7831)|
| 2:10:37| MPCU will vote on it at the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| It will pass, and then it will be in your lap unchanged from what it is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| except for some addendums of public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| And that's slightly troubling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| I do support this recode, but some of the logic in the rules that are being put into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| don't make a whole lot of sense to me and probably shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| I want to just give you one guiding principle when you consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| is you need to ask MPC for the reasons that they're making these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| Everything in here should be justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| I don't think that's something that's too much to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| Just as some examples, ADUs, accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| this covers half of the public comments made about the recode since draft two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7876)|
| 2:11:24| but in draft three they made absolutely no changes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| And so it would seem that ADUs is something they really want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| but when asked about why they want this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| it looks like they're just projecting maybe half a dozen ADUs being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| to support affordable housing over the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| So that doesn't seem like the headache you're going to get about ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| is worth what they're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| I personally support ADUs with a primary residence owner occupancy restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| but I do not understand the push for ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181023?start=7917)|
