| 0:00:00| The interim appointment for State Senate seat number six, the seat that is being vacated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| by State Senator Jamie Woodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=7)|
| 0:00:10| Again, this is an interim position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| They will serve until the election and the new State Senator has been formally elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| and sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=17)|
| 0:00:19| We have five candidates who have submitted resumes to the Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=19)|
| 0:00:24| And what we'd like to do is to ask each of them to come forward when I call their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| We're going to go in alphabetical order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| And to the candidates, we would ask you to give us about three or four minutes of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| that you would like for us to know about you, any statements that you would like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| and then we will ask any questions that the Commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| So the first candidate, or the first person who has submitted an application is Sue Atschley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| Ms. Atschley, if you'd come forward and give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| Sue K. Atschley, 6324 Bowstring Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| I'm here today for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| One, it would be an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Two, as all of you know, my husband was in the legislature for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| The last 24 years was served in this very seat that I'm asking you to let me serve in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=71)|
| 0:01:24| I've been running around the Senate for the 24 years, 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| I feel like that I'm capable of doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| I have confidence in myself that I can handle the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| I see nothing down the road that could possibly come up that would be an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| And if it did, I feel sure I would probably have to have some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| But I still have friends that are serving in the Senate that was there when we were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| I have staff people that are there, still there when I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| I have the best help in the world, the honest, knowledgeable person that's been there and done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=124)|
| 0:02:15| right at my fingertips that could give me help if I needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| I feel like in this position, with the time period that it is, the main thing would be to take care of the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=141)|
| 0:02:33| If they call and they have a problem and they need help, I would make sure that they get the person that can give them help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=153)|
| 0:02:42| I discovered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| It was an eye-opener for me through the years of being in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| I spent many, many hours listening to people that really needed help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| I appreciate you taking time to listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| It would be an honor for me to serve as the interim state senator for the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| I want to thank you all, and I respect your time for serving your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| Again, I'm asking you for your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| I know your time is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| I promise you that I will not, after today, ask you for your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=204)|
| 0:03:32| It would be an honor and a pleasure to serve as the interim senator in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Ms. Ashley, we appreciate you and thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Next, we have Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Mr. Daly, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| Carson Daly, 7508 Government Farm Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| As you would see on the resume, the reason I put in for this, we have an important election coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| and we have three good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| We've got Victoria DeFreeze, Becky Duncan Massey, and Marilyn Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| The focus from here on should be on who is going to be our next senator for the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| And as I said in the resume, this is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| You will not hear, I will have no agenda, there will be nothing to make a point to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| You know, if TV calls or newspaper wants interviews, you won't see one because this is not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| This is about just an interim time that we need to be spending to make sure that we do have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| senate candidate when that time comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Now, if you do appoint me, and I hope that you do, because I do think I have experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| and a lot more experience that I didn't put on the resume because I wanted to keep it short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| but I have been in contact in the previous, not since this time, with Senator Woodson's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| She has got a great staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I have never failed to have an e-mail answer or a phone call return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| So, really, if her staff is still in place, her staff can really do the job down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| And there's no reason to mess with her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Is that staff still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Because, like I say, I've not contacted any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| I've not asked for any vote from any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| And I'm not going to until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| And after today, you may run into me somewhere, but we won't be discussing this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| I just wanted to let you know that if you do appoint me, that be rest assured that the main concern that I will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=355)|
| 0:06:05| is to make sure that the candidates for this district seat, they get the attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| That's the attention that's where it needs to be, is at the district election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| And it may be settled in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| We don't know if it will be settled in September because there may be another independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| or democratic candidate around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| If that's so, then it will go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| But at that point in time, I feel like if you appointed me in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and one of the three candidates is elected, if I get a phone call, I would forward that phone call to that candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| Because that candidate, at that point in time, has been elected by the people and they deserve that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| So, again, I hope you consider me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| I hope everybody's got an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| And it is an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| It's an honor to stand here before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| So I thank you and appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Any questions for Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| This is not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you very much, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I'll say, you know, Carson's been a very good public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| He's served on a lot of committees and volunteered a lot of time, you know, for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| And I know he's been on the Ethics Committee with me and did a very admirable and good job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| And it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| I think you've also been on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| And, as he says, a lot of other things that's not on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| My question really doesn't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| But my question is, when is Senator Woodson's resignation effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| July 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| She has already resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| The seat is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| And then the other question I have is, if I recollect correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| is that I believe that when the election occurs in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| unlike the governor and some of these others, I believe those office holders can take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| they can be sworn in immediately, can't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| It's a little bit different than I think it is from the other elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| So I think right after the November election they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I'm just doing this for general information for everyone else on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| I hope you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| I hope that is right because this appointment shouldn't be until January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| It should be whoever is chosen that they take that seat over at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| And the law director might be able to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| That was the same situation with Mr. Camfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| He took his office right away after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| He was sworn in promptly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| So this would be the same scenario, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| So hopefully this would only be for August and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| We don't know that until September rolls around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Forty-five days before the election, I believe, for a candidate to file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| And when are we going to actually make the selection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| Monday, one week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Quick question for you, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| You have served on a lot of things in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| You've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| And you touched on it real briefly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I think it's going to be constituent services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I doubt you're going to be in Nashville at any minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Knowing that, what is your biggest asset that you bring to the table for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| constituent service and your availability for the district seat, for the 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Well, I believe that with all the prior, with the homeowners groups and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| serving all these communities, that I'm not saying that I get more e-mails than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| you guys do or phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| But the senior citizens in my neighborhood, if they've got a problem, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I'll either contact my commissioner or codes or the sheriff's department or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| So they already rely on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| So they know that if they call me that things will get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| It will be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| And I always get back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| I guess it is I'm a community person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| I love my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| I love the neighbors in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| And if they need help, I'll make sure that they get that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| And like I say, I hopefully, in this two-month, hopefully it will be just like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| two-month time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| If Senator Woodson's staff is still there, all you've got to do is make a phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| They'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| And I'll make sure that that is passed on to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you, Mr. Daly, for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| We appreciate your putting yourself forward for the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Next is John Brian Ewert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| John Brian Ewert, 2919 Reflection Bay Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| My sense of service began with my commitment to the United States Navy in 1991,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| when we were at war in the Persian Gulf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| From boot camp on, I've had the opportunity to serve as a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| I take that service very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| When I was honored and recognized as Junior Sailor of the Year on USS Lake Erie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after elected from there, I was able to be the voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| for our junior personnel and bring issues to our leaders on that ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| And I took that very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| And I loved being the advocate for the junior enlisted personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| I'm truly blessed now to work for Mercy Health Partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| where our mission is to serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| I'm reminded of this every day when I go to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| and I see all the great work that the Sisters of Mercy do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| and see the impact that they have had on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| It's a daily reminder for what we're all here for, serving others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| What I bring to District 6's residents is no political agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| no ties to state government, no prior experience in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| which allows me to truly listen to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| and present that information to current leaders and our future leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| Because of this and my lifelong residency in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| I feel that I can meet and exceed any expectations that you are looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| in this leadership transition time for the 6th District State Senate seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Any questions for Mr. Ewert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| This is not a question of John, but this is in an effort to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| He has listed in his resume that he manages Mercy Health and Fitness at Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=750)|
| 0:12:40| of which I am a proud member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| But we have not spoken of this particular appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| or any other political discussions in my time as being a member there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| I just offer that for disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Just real quick, I know what the other two's political affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| What is your political affiliation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Question on your cover letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| You made a statement that you've been employed by Mercy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| and you're interested in exploring a career change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| I know you're aware this is a caretaker seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| I'm just wondering how is that germane to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| and what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| The career change means that, again, I go from a private citizen to a public citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| I understand that any and all contact that I have will be very public at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| and that is truly a career change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Even though this is a temporary transition period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| trying to bridge that gap between outgoing and incoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| you are a very public person at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| and you have to take that with the responsibility and respects that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| We appreciate your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Next is Tom Midyat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| And if you would give us your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| My name is Tom Midyat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| I live at 667 Kennesaw Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| It's in the Sequoia Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| I, too, am a lifelong resident of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| I wasn't fortunate enough to be born here in East Tennessee, but I got here as quickly as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| And I don't miss those cotton fields and that cotton farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| and cattle farm that I grew up in West Tennessee on in Madison County at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| This has been a wonderful place where I've raised three children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| and have got two sons that live here in Knoxville now and have a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| My wife at one time, when I was in law school here, taught in the public schools here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| I do have a law degree from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| I served nine years as counsel for the Tennessee Public Service Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| I had the fortune or misfortune, as the case may be, of trying some of the most important rate cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| utility rate cases that have ever been considered in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| In that position, I have numerous times argued cases on behalf of the citizens and residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| before the various courts of this state, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| and even the United States Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| In 1979, I was offered an opportunity to move from Nashville to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| and become general counsel at East Tennessee Natural Gas Company here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| which was the largest natural gas pipeline system in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| And served in that capacity until about 1992, when Tenneco, which owned East Tennessee, had a corporate restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=971)|
| 0:16:19| At that time, they wanted me to move to Houston, and I elected not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| So they then kind of created a position for me to become a manager of their state government relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| in what started out to be a six-state area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| It ended up, seven years later, being basically half of the United States from California across to Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| Tenneco was a very diverse company, a conglomerate, if you please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| that owned everything from Case Tractor Company, which was the largest private employer in the state of Wisconsin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| which was one of the states I worked in, Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| which was the largest private employer in the Commonwealth of Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| where they make nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| paper company, packaging companies, oil companies, natural gas pipelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| In that role, I've worked with state governments, with state government officials, not just in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| but basically in half of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| So I know how state government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| But at the same time, in my 40-plus years of practice, both with the Public Service Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| and as a part of the management team of East Tennessee Natural Gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I've worked intricately with government here in Tennessee, the various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| I think I've worked with then-Representative Ben Ashley and certainly Senator Ben Ashley for all the 32 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| that he has so wonderfully served Knox County in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| One example, for instance, that just came up today as I was sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| hearing about the water retention ponds on the property where the liability is being retained by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| I've worked with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Commissioner Martineau over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| back when he was a private attorney, but Commissioner Martineau and his predecessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| the head of the Water Quality Division at TDEC, I've worked with for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| This is the kind of contacts, the kind of information that I have that I feel I can offer to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| to the 6th District, if I am selected to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| I want to make it real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| I'm not running against Sue or John or anybody else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| I have started to wind down my work activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| I'm becoming more and more retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I'm enjoying my local grandchildren more every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I'm enjoying my South Carolina grandchildren more every month or two when I get a chance to get down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| But basically the whole bottom line is, after 40-something years of working in and around state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| this is an opportunity as I am winding down to give something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| I'm doing more volunteer work, as is included in my resume that I submitted to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| I consider this to be basically a volunteer position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| I know the phone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| If somebody's got a problem with a permit in Nashville in a particular department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| or another problem with state government, I know how to help get that problem solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| I have served as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| I was elected to the city commission in Brentwood, Tennessee, a southern suburb of Nashville in Williamson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| At the time that I did not run for re-election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| it was interesting because when I got the opportunity to move to Nashville in 1979,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| it was concluding my term, I had served longer than any other commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Obviously that was 30 years ago and there have been others since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| But I know what it is like to serve as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| I know what it is like to try to accommodate the needs of citizens and constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| And basically that's what I bring to the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| It sounds like you've got some qualified candidates from whom to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| And like I say, I'm not running against anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| I don't have an ill word at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| I don't consider this to be a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| I've got 40 years of experience and work that I've put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| And if the commission chooses to avail themselves of it, I'm willing to put my shoulder to the wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| and fill this position for the next three or four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1265)|

| 0:21:33| and in some cases independent candidates, including Mayor Haslam, Governor Haslam, others in local elections here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1293)|

| 0:22:24| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| What process will we use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Everyone be nominated if there is no majority on the first vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| or what has the election count got to be to secure the position and how do we knock people off the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| What's the procedure going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| If I'm wrong, Mr. Associate Law Director, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| But we will begin with each candidate or each commissioner will have an opportunity to nominate someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| Once those nominations are made, we will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| And if someone gets six votes on the first round, they're elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| If not, we will drop the lowest off, and then we will continue on the second round until someone gets six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110718specialcalled?start=1386)|
