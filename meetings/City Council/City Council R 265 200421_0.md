| 0:05:12| So there's a lot going on, as you guys are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Real quick, I'll start with the COVID-19 update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| and I'm just going to say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| And then Dr. Martha Buchanan, the head of our health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| has graciously decided to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| agreed to be here today to answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=331)|

| 0:05:39| questions from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| But just before she starts speaking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| some of the recent test results show that our curve is flattening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| the social distancing and the safer at home precautions seem to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| working here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I want to thank everyone who is working so hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| residents and businesses for doing their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| The other bit of good news is our hospitals are not overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| They've been very collaborative and careful and preserving and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| conserving PPE for their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| people on the front lines who are very vulnerable to infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| And so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| very few people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| hospitalized. And of those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| our hospitals have not been overwhelmed. So we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| looks like we are meeting some of the criteria that I mentioned weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| ago, that would help us consider lifting some restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| And the criteria I mentioned were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| 14 days of flat or diminishing number of new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| And also that our hospitals had the capacity to handle COVID cases in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| a way where that, you know, that was, that was safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| So I am very aware that the safer at home order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| while it has worked to flatten the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| it's also imposed great economic hardship on people losing wages and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| closing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| And you all are well aware of that because you run businesses or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| or work or, you know, no people who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| So I feel that pain and I understand that people are eager to get back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| work so they can pay their rent and pay their bills and pay their mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| And you guys are obviously very aware of governor Lee's announcement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| as of May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| he's going to be removing some of those statewide restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Although I think it's important to know that that will change some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| things as far as non-essential businesses being allowed to reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| In state and counties, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| that do not have their own health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Knox County is one of six counties in Tennessee that has its own health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| So we are working with Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Buchanan to make sure that we have a plan that works well for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| And of course the city of Knoxville is our particular interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| So with that, I would like Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| Buchanan, if you could show us, since you're going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| be able to answer some questions for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| if you could show on your reveal your face on the video, if you're able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| I think that would just help facilitate communication a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| Cause it's just nice to, we see your face every, every Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Wednesday, Friday during the press conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| but we're really glad that you're able to participate in today's zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| meeting with city council. Cause you know, there's just a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| everything's changing very quickly and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| hearing directly from you about what's happening from your perspective and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| how you think, you know, and able to answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| We'd really appreciate that. So Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Buchanan, if you want to share a few things and then we'll take some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Absolutely. Thank you. Can you guys hear me? Cause I'm, I'm new to all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| So thank you for giving me time on your agenda to speak to you about what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| going on with COVID-19 in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I appreciate Mayor Buchanan's support as we work through this unprecedented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| time in our community, in our nation, and quite frankly, in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| So thank you for, for, for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you for what you're doing to support the efforts of the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| department and to protect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| Just a little bit of information about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| We currently have a hundred and fifty people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| 165 of those have recovered. That's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| 27 have been hospitalized at some point in their illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| today we are very grateful that we can report that there have been no further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| deaths to COVID-19 from COVID-19, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| in our community. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I appreciate that. I mean, sorry, we're grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| A little bit about what we're doing as the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| We are doing contact investigation and tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| There's seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| We have several teams who do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| We have about 34 people dedicated to just that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| We anticipate that we'll be able to do a lot more in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| We have about 34 people dedicated to just that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| We anticipate as we do reopen the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| that our cases will go up. That won't be a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| People are getting out, connecting with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| and sharing things, including COVID-19, which will be so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| why it'll be so important when we do reopen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| that we continue social distancing, that we do it safely. We do it slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| We're very thoughtful about how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| We are testing right now, five days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| with some plans for some increased testing on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| I believe we've confirmed location and a time, potentially for Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| to do a testing event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| I don't want to give out too many details because it's not confirmed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| My staff is still working with the state to confirm the support from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| state to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Part of that support will be in testing supplies so that we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| perform that testing event. We are locating that in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| When we look at where we, the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| have tested people where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| East Knoxville is one of those areas where we don't have a lot of folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| we've tested in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| even though we're really not located all that far from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| So we're, we're locating that in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| And details of that will come out tomorrow or the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Once we have everything firmed up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| you don't want to get anything out there and have to retract it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| So as you know, we started to increase testing this week, five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| We tried to just do kind of an open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| y'all come kind of testing that really kind of overwhelmed our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| And we, we have had to back off on that. We won't be testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| We'll be testing at our facility tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| but we won't be doing a drive-thru test tomorrow because we're having to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| of regroup on that. We tested over 300 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Yeah, about 300 people on Monday and about the same number today from across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| the County. And so we're having to regroup a little bit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Testing supplies continue to be our biggest challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| And it's not just us, it's across the country, it's hospitals, it's providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Everybody's challenged with having enough testing supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| We are working every day to get testing supplies in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| We can get them through our traditional supply chains from the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| Tennessee department of health. But again, it continues to be a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| One of the challenges is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| is actually we have been successful in our social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Our case count is not that high, so we're not a hotspot in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| So some resources are being reallocated to those hotspots in West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| So it's not a bad thing, but it makes it challenging for us here on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| As you know, we have a map out there of testing locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| There's been a little misunderstanding. Those are not our testing locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| Those are outpatient providers, walk-in clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| doctor's offices who've told us they're testing, not just their own patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| but testing for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| So we put that out there so people know where they can go get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| If they're providers at testing and they have insurance and they can go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| and get tested if they want to. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| those are places where they are their private offices who are doing testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| And we're grateful for that. But that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| we have no determination of where those are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Those are based on a business decision by that company on where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| to locate a clinic. And as you know, we've also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| or if you've gone to our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| you'll also see that we have a map of where the cases are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| And also been a little confusion about that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| That map was really just to say there are this many cases in this zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| It's not about risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| It's not about anything else other than there are this many cases in this zip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| code for informational purposes for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| And we continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| We're working with the city to craft a reopen plan so that people can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| it and provide guidance to businesses and to the community on what reopening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| looks like. Cause we're not exactly sure what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| None of us have been here before. And so we're all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| we're all kind of learning together what this could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| We believe that the business community and the community need guidance to feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| safe going back to business. It won't be business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| It won't be business pre pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| It'll be a new new normal for us for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And social distancing is going to be the norm for us for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| So I think we all need to get used to virtual things and social distancing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| a while. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| in anticipation of a vaccine probably isn't going to occur until maybe next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| year. Treatment might happen before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| but the vaccine is probably at least next year before we'll have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| available for anybody for regular, for general public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| And with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I will pause and take questions because mostly it really was an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| y'all to ask questions of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you so much, Dr. Buchanan. I, I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| I want to first just say you and your team at the health department have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| working incredibly hard in a very, very difficult circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| And I see that and I know council does too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| and we appreciate it and just super grateful for all your hard work every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I also want to just commend the transparency that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| The website's really good. And every time people have said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I'd like to see a map. And then like the next day, there's a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| And people said, I'd like to see the demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| And then you share that. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Thanks for being transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| People really wanted a test site in East Knoxville for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| and it sounds like you've been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| And I know the details are yet to, to be announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| but I'm very grateful for that too. So, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| And I'm going to let council members ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you, mayor. Dr. Buchanan, talking about guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Do you have any idea or any timeframe when you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| when you and the team that you're working with want to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| we'll be able to provide some guidance as one of those people who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| anxiously awaiting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Absolutely. So the, the way we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| we're looking at this as we actually are waiting for the governor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| guidance to come out so that we can kind of fold in what we're doing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| be supportive and complimentary to that guidance so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| we all know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| that competing in from our different information from leadership is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| those things that one creates some fear and just creates confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| This is confusing enough. We really want to be able to fold into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| So we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Once we see the governor's guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| we'll look at that and marry the two up so that, that they look that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| that businesses here aren't having to figure out what's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| what are the rules and, and you know, Jefferson County versus Fox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| So hopefully that'll be early next week. That's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| that's what I was thinking. If that's for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| by the end of next week, we would, we would hope. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1059)|
| 0:17:50| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you, mayor. And thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| I'm very pleased to hear that there's going to be a testing site in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Knoxville. As we all know that East Knoxville is one of our most vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| communities. We all have seen, even from a national level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| the disparities among African-Americans as it relates to this virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| as well as just healthcare in general. I would like to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| is this going to be a temporary testing site or will it be a testing site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| on an ongoing basis, even if it's certain days of the week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| In addition to that, I'd like to ask if there were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| if there will be any plans or any insight into testing and additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| communities that are vulnerable, such as Lonsdale, Mechanicsville and Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| So at this time, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| in part due to staff capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| staffing capacity and testing kit capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Right now, this will be a one-time event in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| We will continue to do five days a week. We'll continue to do testing at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| I believe we're going to keep that at the location it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| which is an engineering and public works building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| which is not the easiest building to walk to, but it is on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| I believe on a bus line and can be accessed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| We also are doing walk-up testing at our main facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| which is located as you know, just north of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| So we're trying to accommodate those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| We're also really encouraging providers in the community to be doing testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| And I know that Cherokee Health has been doing some testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| I've talked to Melissa at Interfaith once a night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| and I believe they're doing testing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| So we're encouraging providers to do that testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| and especially the providers who are working with folks that are at a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| risk. We do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| we are considering looking at other testing locations around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| We don't want to stand something up and not have the supplies to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| So we like to have the supplies in hand before we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| This week has been an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| We thought we had enough to make it through the week and we ended up not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| having enough. And we really hate to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| So again, we continue to, and again, it's not limited to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| All of us who want to test continue to struggle to get those supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| And I know that here nationally and even at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| there's no problem with supplies or access, but supplies are a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| And it's not necessarily PPE for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Some places are having challenges with PPE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| but that's less of a problem than actually the supplies to collect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| specimens. And the lab capacity is also a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| So we'd love to do more. We just hate to overpromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| So Dr. Buchanan, let me follow up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| What is your potential capacity for testing at the one day event that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| held in East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Now you're testing my memory. We, I think we plan on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| don't hold me to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| I believe the number is that we want to be able to do 600 tests at that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| that one day. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| that's my memory based on what my staff told me earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| And just for reference, we did about 300, a little more than 300 yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| probably about the same number today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| So we're setting up so that we can do multiple lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| and have a faster put through as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| So more folks can go through and get tested at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Okay. Ideally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Okay. And I know I'm sure the mayor has, or some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| her staff has shared with you that there was a conference call last week at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| the request of several community organizations that were very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| about the lack of testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| In our vulnerable communities that call did actually have some healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| professionals that were on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| So I don't know if there will be opportunity to maybe partner with some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| those healthcare licensed healthcare professionals to do some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| screening. If you're, if it's a staffing capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| or even partnership with Cherokee health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| But I really feel like we have got to target those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| You really have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I think that you understand what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| and I would just like to ask the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| our mayor as well as the County mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| if they will just continue to partner to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| to do whatever we can to make sure that that happens. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| there's really high concern for those populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| And I just wanted to express that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Sure. Thank you. I understand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| And we are concerned about those populations as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| and how to penetrate that community with access to testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| So we, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| we will continue to partner with those communities to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| there's high concern for those populations as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| and how to penetrate that community with access to testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| So we'll, we, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Are looking for different options. And I think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Some of the challenge comes back to having supplies to do testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Cherokee and is not alone and we're not alone in that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| It's a problem across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan and vice mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| thank you for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| I know your team has been working overtime, needless to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| I feel like today I might've heard some conflicting messaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| So just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Is it appointment based or are you able to drive up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| It seemed like it was drive up and then it may have switched back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| appointment base. So I just wanted to clarify and you may have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| It did switch back and that was in an effort to conserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thinking about trying to do an event on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Trying to conserve supplies. So we have enough to do that event on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| As I, as I said, the response to the y'all come drive up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| get tested was pretty overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| And we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| She probably shouldn't have been, but we were a little surprised by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| And so in order to keep having enough supplies to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| To be able to drive up and get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| We have had to cut that back to appointments. We're still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| We still expanded the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| So we expanded the symptom list to be what they're calling COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| like illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| So that includes the three big ones, fever, cough, shortness of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| But it also adds headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| And then the last one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Loss of taste or smell, which is a weird one that they're seeing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| So that expands a little bit. We also expanded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| To have more access to folks who are higher risk for complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| So, and I'm not going to, those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| those are folks with other illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Or maybe there are contact to a confirmed case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| So trying to expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Cautiously to not, to not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| To not have to go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Because we also have to maintain supplies to be able to test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Contacts of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| That are symptomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| So it's a real challenge, but that did change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| That messaging is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| And it was a decision we had to make today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| That was unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you. Councilwoman Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Hi, Shannon. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And thank you for the daily updates as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| And I know, well, I should say they, they went to about three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| And I know I heard today, you guys were going back to five day a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| That response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Can I ask you about contact tracing? I think that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Is your opinion that it'll be incredibly important as people try to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| back and open back up in a slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Metered fashion. But you said, I think I believe you said a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| you had about 34 employees that were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I'm assuming those are employees that shifted to do that from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| is there an anticipation that you'll need more people to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| That's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| I think it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I know that there's a lot of employees that have shifted from other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| within the county or something or some other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| maybe within the healthcare or the city or something to be able to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| those roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| If needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| But then the other question, part of my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Is there an education component for the community in terms of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| prepared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| COVID-19 positive and experienced it. I believe she was able to stay home. This was not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| this was somewhere else I saw in a news report. But she talked about being able to answer those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| questions because she wasn't thinking about it and wasn't logging where she had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| because it wasn't in her field of thought. And so I wonder if there's a way that we could kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| of educate people to just be kind of mindful of what we've done. Because I know it's really easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| to forget where you've been and what you've done and who you've been in contact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Sure. So it's a great point and certainly something to remind people to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| You're correct. Contact tracing will become, as we get more cases, as people go back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| contact tracing will become more and more important. Right now, because of social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| and the stay-at-home order, we're only having about four or five contacts per case, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| great. That number will go up as people get out and about and have lunch with friends and do other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| things. You know, we obviously, we start with the family and move out from there. So yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| logging where you've been is a good idea. The nice thing about COVID-19 is we are not going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| sometimes we have to go about like a week or more back in people's memory to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| where have you been? With COVID-19, we only go two days prior to onset of symptoms based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| science and incubation and all that stuff and infectious period. So what's really more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| important is if you're sick, that you self-isolate until you know what you have. So if you self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| isolate, then your contacts two days before are the only ones we need to know about. And if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| self-isolated, you're not going to have a bunch of contacts during isolation. Anyone who gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| tested, regardless of their symptoms, should self-isolate until their test results come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| That keeps them from exposing others in case they are actually a case. But not a bad idea to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| down where you've been because I can't remember what I had for lunch yesterday. So asking people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| to go a few days back in their memory is a challenge. So not a bad idea at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I just would like to comment. Maybe that needs to be information that's on the website. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| want to have people be paranoid or overly anxious about it. But just as we move forward and we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| reopening, I think that's a component that people need to be prepared for and maybe an education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| component so that people can be just mindful without being anxious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Yeah. And I think I didn't answer your question about staffing up for contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| Contact tracing. Our plan is to activate our staff. We have a few staff to activate. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| have many right now because most of them are working. But in addition to that, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| mayor has committed to letting us pull in county staff as needed. We also could reach out to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1772)|
| 0:29:41| contacts that we have. And even I've thought about, can we activate any school staff? I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1781)|
| 0:29:50| talked to Superintendent Thomas about that, but it seems reasonable. Those are folks that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| help us do that because it really is, it's really being, you need to be detail oriented and a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| listener and take a good history to be able to do contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| I'd just like to add, Dr. Buchanan, that I certainly would be happy to offer city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| as needed and as their skills and time allow. But I like those, those are good options. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1812)|
| 0:30:21| hopefully we have a good containment strategy and we have contact tracing needs, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| not needing in the thousands, but more hundreds. Are there other questions for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| Yes, Councilman Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for this brief, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1836)|
| 0:30:46| information you've been bringing to our attention and then, you know, our conversations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| I wanted to ask about antibody testing. I know we've been talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| if you're sick, isolating, and, you know, there was great questions already today about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| you know, follow-up and contact tracing and how to get testing if you're not feeling well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| But do we have any activity in the antibody testing? And maybe could you talk a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| bit about what that is and what kind of information it could provide for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Sure. So antibody testing is something that we use with other diseases on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| to see if you're immune. Unfortunately, antibody testing for new, any new illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| not just COVID-19, has to be validated over time. So the antibody testing that is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1890)|
| 0:31:39| it has not yet been validated for use in patient care. It's still validated, it's still recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| only for experimental use. I know that local labs are working to validate the test so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| use it. So just a little one-on-one on antibody testing. Antibody testing tells us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| tests you for IgM and IgG or both. Those are antibody markers. And IgG is the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| that you produce when you get sick. Sorry, no, IgM is the first thing you produce when you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| sick. IgG is the second thing. And if we see IgM, we know you're acutely ill. If we see both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| you're probably recovering. If we just see IgG, you are considered to be immune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| But with COVID-19, again, I'll go back to that testing has not been validated. I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| a problem with crossover with other coronaviruses, such as the virus that causes the common cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| So it's not ready for real-time use yet. We're hoping that it will be soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| because that would be really helpful. It's a test that can be done with a finger prick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| in the office most of the time. So we're hoping that'll be available soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Any other questions for Dr. Buchanan? Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Yes, thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for being with us here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| and answering our questions. I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I had a few questions. One was a clarification about the test Knox County is hoping to get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| the state in a few days or this weekend. Are we guaranteed to get additional tests? And if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| how many do you anticipate we'll get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| We have asked for 600. We are not guaranteed to get them. Until we have them in our grasp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| we are not guaranteed to get those. The state has the ability to redirect resources as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| I know that they have been fulfilling those orders. The governor has made a push. He wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| testing to be done across the state, so he has been encouraging the fulfillment of those orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| so it can be spread across the entire state. And so we're hopeful that we will get those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| but we don't have a guarantee. And so if something happens and we don't have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| we'll have to reschedule the testing event we have planned for this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| So we're very hopeful that we'll get those. My staff talked to staff at the state this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| and our understanding is that we should get them, but I don't count on it until I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Okay. And that somewhat speaks to my next question, but we've seen concerning stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2067)|
| 0:34:41| throughout the country of hotspots popping up in vulnerable places. We've seen a report out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| of Bledsoe County of a spike in positive cases once more testing was done at a prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2087)|
| 0:34:56| Is there a plan in Knox County to do some comprehensive testing at vulnerable places like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| jail and nursing homes? Well, actually, we're working with our jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| and they have a plan in place that they've implemented and are testing folks as indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| and actually quarantining folks appropriately. They're actually doing a really great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| and we're working closely with them to make sure they have what they need to test when they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| to test. We also, through our regional hospital coordinator, have worked with our long-term care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| facilities to make sure they have access to the PPE they need. If they get a single case in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| long-term care facility in Knox County, we will work with them very closely to isolate the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| to isolate the other patients and get everybody tested. If you remember, we've had a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| cases, at least two. There may have been more in that one facility in Knox County. And two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| employees were ill as well. Everybody else got tested and everybody else was negative. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| that methodology worked. They did a really great job of isolating the case to an area of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| facility so that other people weren't exposed. So, that worked really well. And like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| previously, we are looking at if we can secure supplies to do other testing, offer testing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| other areas in Knox County as we can. And so, we also are working closely with the city and BMC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2189)|
| 0:36:39| CARM to get any at-risk homeless folks who have symptoms to get them tested and out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| population so that we don't have cases among our homeless population. It seems like if the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2206)|
| 0:37:00| or city even wanted to, you know, for instance, among our homeless population just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| test everyone, even asymptomatic folks, we don't have access to the testing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| We don't. We don't. We don't have limitless testing supplies. You know, as somebody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| practices evidence-based medicine, you know, testing asymptomatic people is one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| things that kind of goes against evidence-based medicine. We really look at testing symptomatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| people for anything, regardless of what we're talking about and regardless of who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| So, using our supplies wisely, testing mostly focusing on symptomatic people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| and people who have had an exposure is the best approach while we have limited supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| Okay, thank you. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| Any more, oops, any more questions from council members for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2280)|
| 0:38:08| I have a question. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| So, well, I guess I'm looking forward to working with the health department. A lot of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| I mean, we have been working together, but now we're reaching, you know, it's like every week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| there's a new decision-making point that's super critical, that's getting a lot of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| attention and angst, and another one is upon us. And I'm getting a lot of feedback from business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2308)|
| 0:38:36| owners. They want to reopen, but they also want to be sure that their employees are safe and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| their customers are safe. So, I guess I'm looking forward to working with you and the state and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and other task forces to sharing guidelines with entities that, I mean, these criteria and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| guidelines can be consistent across the nation, really, whether if you're a barbershop in Minnesota| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| or in Tennessee, you know, the standards should be the same. So, I'm looking forward because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| think businesses want to reopen, but safely. So, thank you for helping us work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| One question I have is sort of about timing, you know, because we are definitely better off than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| the other major metro areas in Tennessee, but, you know, we have some instances of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| and what I'm really a little worried about and what I hear concerns about from city residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| is that we start lifting the restrictions, and then people relax their guard, and then we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| you know, we expect to see an uptick somewhat because, as you said, as people circulate out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| in the community more, they're interacting, and the chances of interacting with someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| who may be contagious and not know it go up. So, how can we get people to, how can we lift some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| those restrictions, but also encourage people to maintain their guard and say, okay, yes, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| be going back to this office environment and earning my, you know, going back to my job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| and earning a living, but, you know, like I know people, for example, you know, they've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| well, if you're vulnerable, just stay home. If you're surviving from, you know, if you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| immunosuppression issue, stay home. If you are really old, you're more vulnerable, stay home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| but there are people who feel vulnerable and have immunosuppression issues who can't stay home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| because their bosses are going to be like, you come back to work, and we'll give you some gloves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| and a mask, and you go, or maybe they don't even provide a glove and mask. So, tell me, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| how we can start lifting restrictions and also, I know there's no guarantees, but how can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| assure people that we're going to deal with, you know, not drop our guard? That's a great question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2459)|
| 0:41:09| and to be honest, I think the message I want people to hear and all of you to hear is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| it's really up to all of us, businesses, citizens, churches, communities, whether or not we are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2476)|
| 0:41:26| to open slowly in a stepwise fashion and stay open, because if we open slowly in a stepwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| fashion and people do let down their guard and we see a significant spike in cases, we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| to regroup and say, okay, you know, we tried to open, but now we're going to have to back off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| So, one is giving, you know, clear guidance to businesses on things they should do. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| education and information is power, and if we give businesses clear guidance, they're going to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| that. Nobody wants to have to close down again, excuse me, and we need to give clear guidance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| the citizens and give them some responsibility for maintaining what level of open we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| and then being able to go to the next step, you know, and maybe we celebrate those steps, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| by saying, hey guys, we did it. We're opening to the next level. I don't know what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| but it's a combination of information, education, and empowerment. That's what we have to do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| empower our community to move forward. The successes we have now are due to the work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| my staff, but they're also due to the work of our community, and so we want to maintain those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| and not lose that momentum. So, that's the way I see it, and that's why we're spending so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| much time on trying to create a plan with some very specific guidance for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| and for the community on how to stay safe. That sounds good. What if like part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| guidance is, say, for, you know, a business to provide masks for their employees, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2581)|
| 0:43:11| they're not able to acquire masks? Do they still get to open? I mean, like, you know, those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| like, what if they say, okay, I've read the guidance, and then, and they say they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| to follow it, but then they're, you know, someone comes to the health department and says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| I work at the store, and they, and the guidance you issued said they're supposed to give me gloves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and the masks, but they're not. What happens then? You know, we do regulation every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| and our approach to regulation is really about partnership and education and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| When we have to, we close things down, but we acknowledge that when we do that, we're not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| impacting that business owner. We're impacting the people that work for them who might be hourly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| wage workers who are going to now have to choose between, you know, rent and food or whatever they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| have to choose between because they're not taking home a paycheck. So, we're very knowledge, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| cautious about that. So, you know, what my staff will do is reach out and educate those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| offer them resources to be able to obtain the things that they need to be able to allow their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| employees to work safely. You know, it's really, we're not, we, public health, are not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| business of closing down businesses. We're really in the business of protecting health. Sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| that means businesses have to close, but usually we can get people to be cooperative, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| if we give them resources and information. Right. Well, I totally agree with the message of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| empowerment and that information and resources are part of that. So, I wonder also, you said that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| some point, if we drop our guard and aren't as careful as we need to be, we might reach a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| threshold that we need to, you know, regroup, as you said. So, are we, I think it's important to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| with the public what those thresholds might be. So then, if like, let's say, you know, right now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| maybe just have two new cases a day, but maybe in three weeks, what if we have 50? Is that a threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2704)|
| 0:45:13| I don't know yet. Yeah. I don't have that number because I don't think we know what reopening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| what change that's going to cause. So, at the beginning, we're going to have an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| And honestly, for those of you who, like the state tested 11,000 people across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| last weekend, those tests are going to start rolling in, those results are going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| rolling in, and it's going to look like we have a spike because we're going to get new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| All from those couple of days of testing. And we have to watch that, and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| and observe it. So, it's really based on the trend and the data, and how we can look back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| you know, if we look back and say, okay, all of these people were tested that one weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| that's not necessarily, I mean, that's an increase, but that's also an increased access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| to testing, which we know is going to increase cases. So, I think we have to look at all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| factors together, and we can't base it just on testing, I'll be honest, because our testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| capacity is so limited, and I don't see it getting a whole lot better. We're not a hotspot as a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| and we're not a hotspot in the state. So, hotspots are getting all the attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| not a bad thing, they need all the attention. So, when we, my staff and I have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| and the way we track flu is we look at doctor visits for the flu, we looked at hospitalizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| and we looked at, look at deaths, and we look at testing. We look at all those factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| we already have a way to track those visits in our, one of our systems called, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| called Essence, it's our syndromic surveillance system. The state's already built the syndrome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| of COVID-19, so that's one way to track. People go to the doctor, they have those symptoms, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| can see that a lot of people are going to the doctor, or fewer people are going to the doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| for those symptoms. Hospitalizations are pretty easy, deaths are obviously, unfortunately, easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| to track as well, and then the testing. So, we combine all those pieces of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| and the situation in the community, to make that determination. So, I don't know if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| be able to say, if we hit this, we're going to close things down. That'd be nice, it's not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| neat. Okay. All right, well, it's really complicated and hard, and I appreciate your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| and expertise. Councilwoman Parker, did you have a question? Yeah, if I could ask one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| I just remembered in your press conference, Dr. Buchanan, I believe you said that the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| safer at home order has already expired, but the state order is still in effect. Yes. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| nothing has changed until the state order expires? Correct. Okay, I just wanted to clarify that. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| ma'am. Thank you. Well, and just to clarify also, the City of Knoxville, we have our own order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| and then we adopted the health department, the Knox County order verbatim, so we could work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| together on enforcement, and that's been a really good partnership. I think that the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| department's used to enforcing this kind of thing, and it's a new thing for the city, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| Ronnie Neese, and the other team of people working with Peter Ahrens, and some of our fire inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| and again, we follow the approach of the health department, that it's a partnership, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| about informing people, and educating people, and we also in the city are not in the business of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| closing things down. We want to keep things open, and also consistent with public health advice. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| yeah. All right, I don't have any more questions. Any other questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| Okay, Dr. Buchanan, thank you so much for your time, and we'll be in touch again soon. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you. Okay, let me get back. A couple more things I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| mention to you guys. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| in addition to the work that we're working with the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| last week we also convened a task force of the major metro areas, you know, the Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville are working together to, you know, have this task force of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| health workers, health experts, as well as business experts to examine the criteria for reopening the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| economy. So, thank you to Deputy Mayor Stephanie Welch. She's the lead on that for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2989)|
| 0:49:58| As you all know, Stephanie has a lot of qualifications to serve in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| In addition to her work on economic stuff, she's also a major and an executive officer in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| Tennessee military army, and has also previously worked at the health department. So, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| people that we appointed are Kathy Brown, who's the leader at the UT Department of Public Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| and a regional, former regional epidemiologist and director of community assessment and health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| promotion at the Knox County Health Department. On the business side, we have Dave Miller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| from First Horizon Bank. He's the regional president of our First Horizon Bank here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| Knox County in East Tennessee. Mike Odom, the head of the Knoxville Chamber, and I also thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| was important to have a small business representative on there. So, Ryan Steffi, who's the manager of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| SoNoTaco, and also has a background in emergency management work. So, you know, just to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3052)|
| 0:51:02| I do realize that people are out of work and struggling economically, both business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| and workers. So, we are working hard to, you know, strike this balance between reopening the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| while also trying to protect people from this pandemic. And we've done a good job on social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| distancing, and I'm confident that we can move forward in a way that's measured and data-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3081)|
| 0:51:28| and hopefully, you know, reopen the economy slowly and gradually in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| makes it so we don't have to close it down again, because that would also be bad news for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| economy and our health. So, also in the meantime, I'm going to be proposing a significant city-funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| initiative to help those hurt by COVID-19 shutdowns. I'm talking about city dollars that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| will complement assistance available through the federal and state governments, but we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| to be focusing intensely on local Knoxville needs that aren't being fully addressed. So, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| segue into my next topic, which is the city budget. One of the many events that has been canceled due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| to COVID-19 was the State of the City budget presentation. Usually, we have a large gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| and a brown bag lunch under a tent, but we can't do that this year. But, of course, the budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| Boyce Evans and his team have been working really hard to put together our budget. So, the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| continues, and rather than a big public announcement, I'll be doing an announcement Friday via short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| video and media release. So, we're not going to have a large gathering because that's not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| or safe, but I'll share the information through a video and then have all the detailed documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| available to council and to the media and the public at the same time. So, look for that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| Friday, and it'll be up on the website at knoxvilletn.gov slash budget. As you all recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3173)|
| 0:53:03| the shutdown in businesses and layoffs has hurt families, it's also had an impact on the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| revenues. We're projecting a loss of eight or nine million due to the effects of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| So, we're tightening our belt and focusing on only the most critical spending. So, this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3195)|
| 0:53:24| be a no-frills budget, but luckily, my predecessors, Mayor Rojero, Mayor Haslam, and previous mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| have all been good financial stewards, and we have a fund balance and reserve funds. So, we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| to, you know, not have to be, we can still maintain our pension system. We're going to be able to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| care of our infrastructure. We don't have to defer maintenance, and considering we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| in the middle of a global pandemic, we're in strong financial shape and well positioned to withstand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| this financial hit. Our employees are our strongest asset, and they are getter-done innovators and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| problem solvers who embrace public service and love Knoxville and its people, and it's our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| to weather this tough time and not to furlough our employees. On the back end of this, once the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| pandemic is in check and our businesses are fully reopened, our local economy will again be booming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| and our commercial corridor is robust. That is certainly my hope and, you know, I think yours too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| So, I want to thank you, Knoxville and City Council for your patience and selflessness and for taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| care of one another, and I'm really glad that we are Knoxville together. That says a lot about who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| we are. So, that's my mayor's report, and I really appreciate, again, Dr. Buchanan's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| I know, you know, the main questions people had were really about some of the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| issues, so I appreciate that she was able to take time. Are there any questions from Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| members about stuff that I mentioned that aren't questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3292)|
| 0:55:01| Yes, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Oh, I just wanted to clarify when it comes to your order, Safer at Home order, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3303)|
| 0:55:15| you're in agreement with Dr. Buchanan that the city should follow the state, or are you following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3315)|
| 0:55:25| data to see if we will be ready by the time the renewal is up for the order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3325)|
| 0:55:35| Well, it's certainly my hope that we continue to see a flat curve with declining number of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| declining or flat number of cases. I do believe that we should be data-driven and not date-driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3343)|
| 0:55:52| but so far, it is looking pretty good, and I think that there's, if we can reopen and lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| these restrictions in a safe manner, I think that that's certainly something I'd like to do. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3359)|

| 0:57:37| start lifting some restrictions. I do have just another follow-up question. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| there's some concern, and there's lots of concern in the community, but one of those concerns is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| once a safer at home order is lifted, folks will not see that as a gradual lifting of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3473)|

| 0:58:09| Could there be a scenario where the safer at home order stays in place, but there are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| businesses open under it? I think that raises up a good point. I mean, I think there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| between the messaging and rhetoric and the substance, and the way Governor Lee described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| it to city mayors and, you know, the mayors involved in the six counties that his safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3507)|

| 0:58:40| businesses, and it'll be gradual and all this stuff, but, you know, his outside voice is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| let's lift all the, you know, let's get back to work, and so it's sending this message out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| people that the worst is over and we can get back to normal, but I agree with you completely. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| think the message should be like, let's reopen, but gradually and safely, and we still need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| be on guard, and it's a new normal. We need to make sure that the people of Knoxville and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| surrounding counties, because they're coming into Knoxville to shop. They're coming into Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3549)|

| 0:59:19| you that I want the message to, you know, so maybe we keep a safer at home order, but lift some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| restrictions and still call it the, you know, safer at home order that's effective May 1st, and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| you know, round two of safer at home. You know, these are, these are, because I do think the messaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| is really important because businesses want to reopen, but they don't want to spread the illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| to themselves or their customers, so that's a good point, and I'm certainly hoping to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| that kind of tone to the messaging because there are a lot of vulnerable people. I've been getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| just as many businesses have contacted me saying, please reopen the city for business, and I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| that's the goal, and then other people are saying like, please keep everything closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I'm worried that I'm going to get COVID and, you know, you know, so we, we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| address those concerns in substance and in messaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Thank you. Yeah, Ms. Testerman. So, we received notice that East Tennessee mayors are meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| tomorrow. Is that to talk about the reopening? Is it essentially going to be this dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| or are there going to be other topics you anticipate? This is the, the Mayor Jacobs has mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| Yeah, are you, are you a part of that, or? That's a, that's, he did mention it to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| and said I'd be welcome to attend if I wanted. I have a conflict, so I don't think I'll be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| to attend. I'll, if I can change my other thing, maybe I will, but my, my understanding is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| you know, they're just there to say that they are, support the Governor's plan and want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| you know, move forward with that. So, I don't think it's going to be a dialogue so much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| an announcement of their support. So, so that, and that brings up sort of the, the messaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| thing. Like, I think there's a lot of overlap with what we want to do, and how and when to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| but there's a divergence a little bit in the messaging, because I'm like, we got to still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| careful, and let's do this slowly and gradually, and make sure that we're not going so fast that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| we have an outbreak that we can't contain. And I think everybody agrees with that in their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| in their sentiments, and in their analytical mind as well, but, but the rhetoric is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| let's get back to business and open everything up. And I think that, that sends a message that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| is a little less cautious than I think is appropriate, and during, given our circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| So, if you guys can help spread that message that, you know, if the data still support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| to lift these restrictions, which I sure hope they do, it'd be great if Council can work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| us as a city to say, good news, the curve is flat, we're able to lift some restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| but we still need to be careful, we still need to follow the guidelines, we still need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| you know, limit our, our, our exposure to other people to the extent as possible while still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| you know, earning a living. So, you know, wear the masks, and where it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| and use gloves, wash your hands, all those things. It's not back to the way it was in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3746)|

| 1:02:38| thought of something I wanted to throw out there at you, and possibly Chief Thomas, if she is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| with us. This weekend, we saw people who were protesting. I'm not sure what the, the volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| the number of people that were out there, but of course, it appeared from the news that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| well more than 10 people that were out there. With the governor's order not being lifted until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| the 30th, if we continue to see that type of behavior of large, large crowds gathering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| what is our responsibility, or what, you know, I guess first question is, were they given any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| type of notice to disperse, etc. this weekend, and if this were to continue into this coming weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| what actions would we as a city need to take, just even for the, for public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| since we're still under the guidance of less than 10 people gathering and the six foot distancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3811)|
| 1:03:40| Well, I think this is a tough question, because there's constitutional matters that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| sometimes aren't consistent with these orders, and I mean, I think that, you know, I don't think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| police were, were, were off in a distance to make sure there is no issues with, with traffic or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| other issues. But I know, I think there's another one planned by a different political group and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| political leanings this weekend. And, you know, as our general policy has been to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| just make certain things are safe, but not to prohibit that because of, you know, constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| issues. But Chief Thomas, if you're on and you want to speak to that, but we're going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| with KPD and law and, you know, try to treat everybody as fairly and they, you know, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| were outside. And I think that I don't, I didn't attend or watch the event, but it's, it's a tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3872)|

| 1:04:44| you know, constitutional right to assemble and also trying to encourage people to practice good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| health things. Chief Thomas, did you want, I don't know if you're on, but if you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| Yes, mayor, I am on, and you said it exactly right. You know, there is a constitutional right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| I actually was out there. There were probably between 80 and a hundred by the time the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| was over. It was very well organized. I can't say that everybody was six foot apart. They,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| they were not standing really close together, but they do have a right to, to assemble and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| free speech. So we are trying to walk that, walk that tight rope and, and make sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| stays safe. Okay. So to, to add to that, I want us to be very cautious because I'm not sure what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3922)|
| 1:05:32| the difference would be in that group of people who were protesting openly. And now it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| it sounds like there were 80 to a hundred people versus a group of young people who might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| gathered. Maybe let's say 20 to 30 of them in East Knottsville. Would they, would we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3945)|
| 1:05:54| monitor them from a distance as well? I just want to make sure that we're consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| I agree. I understand your concern. You know, and I don't know what those young people would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| be doing. If they're playing basketball, something of that sort, then that's, that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| they're, they're, they're endangering themselves. And that's what the emergency order is for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| we're trying to keep people healthy. You know, it is, it's hard. It's hard. The right to free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| speech and right to assemble are guaranteed constitutionally. So it's, it's a, it's a tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| rope and we look for the law department listings as well. Yeah. And, and Chief Thomas, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| In that scenario, I was speaking of just young people who were parked and standing around their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| cars talking because if they're on a basketball court, that would be in violation. But if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| are just, they're just hanging out talking. I don't see any difference in that versus what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| saw this weekend. So I just want us to be very, very mindful of that and the, and the perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| of what that could potentially lead to. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4017)|

| 1:08:09| and Poverty. Haven't had a chance to follow back up on email, but wanted to update you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| on this call tonight. But one thing I'm really interested to see from, you know, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4095)|
| 1:08:26| and we have the mayor's, you know, budget presentation coming up next week is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4106)|
| 1:08:36| a sense of how we are taking advantage of those funds during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| And what our plan is to keep those vulnerable populations safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| as a city. Obviously, the county plays a role, but the city does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| And on our last call, we heard from the United Way, and I was concerned that there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4133)|
| 1:09:03| groups who were not necessarily, their work wasn't necessarily being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4143)|
| 1:09:13| included in the coordination efforts of the city. And so I wanted to invite some of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4153)|
| 1:09:23| who've been doing some of that work to this call to share in my update to help us get a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| understanding of what those needs are among our most vulnerable population and what role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| these volunteers have been serving in our community to try to meet those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| So I know that we have two individuals on the call with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4186)|
| 1:09:55| And first, and there's one other person who was supposed to join us, but I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4195)|
| 1:10:06| I don't think they were able to get into the meeting. And that was the Next Step Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| But we're, many of us are very familiar with their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| The reason I wanted to invite them to the call is because I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| I wanted everyone to get a sense of, man, the level of outreach that they're doing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4224)|
| 1:10:34| you know, the pennies that they're doing it with. And when they described to me a lot of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| that they're doing, it is something I would have expected either the city or the county to lead on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4239)|
| 1:10:48| And so I wanted to see what, you know, what our plan is going to be for next year. So I'm happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| that the mayor has that focus in her budget presentation for next week. But since they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| cannot join us, I wanted to invite Keenan Grimes Community Outreach Center, who many of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| may have seen on social media, who's been very active. I've invited Mr. Grimes, Ira Grimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4270)|
| 1:11:18| from that group to share with us briefly. And I assume that I, do I direct all of this or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4278)|
| 1:11:29| we'll do it? Is this a committee or council member report? Or do you, would this be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| appropriate to hear a public forum? Because, I mean, I don't know this. Yeah, no, it's a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| of my report. Okay. Well, should we keep you know, how many people do you plan to ask to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4302)|
| 1:11:55| I have two. Okay. And they're both on? I've enabled Ira Grimes to speak. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| Mr. Grimes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4324)|
| 1:12:14| Looks like it's still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Well, he may have to unmute himself. I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| What's the button for doing that? Is it pound six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| That's only if he phoned in. I believe he's joined over Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| It's star nine if he is telephoned in, but. There's two connections. So, that's likely that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4355)|
| 1:12:47| he has also called in. Mr. Grimes, are you joining us by phone? Can you press star nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| Okay. Well, we can come back to Mr. Grimes and maybe, hopefully, he can figure out how to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4374)|
| 1:13:10| So, next, I'm going to go to the First Aid Collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| And Klein has joined us from the First Aid Collective to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| some information about the needs that they are seeing in the community. Thanks for joining us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| Klein. Yeah, grateful to be here. So, yeah, my name is Caroline Roecliffe, and I go by Klein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| but I'm speaking on behalf of the First Aid Collective of Knoxville. And we're an autonomous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| First Aid and Care Collective based here in Knoxville. And our mission mainly focuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| around harm reduction and meeting people where they're at and not leaving them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| And FACT has worked with Choice Health Network's Syringe Service Program for a little over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| now, where we've been supplying wound care, emergency contraceptive, and First Aid supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| to people. And now, presently, in the time of COVID-19, we've been laying a lot of groundwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| for mutual aid efforts around Knoxville because, unfortunately, we knew that the city would fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| its most vulnerable communities. So, for the last month, FACT has supplied the homeless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| with about over 600 lunches, hundreds of masks, about 1,000 naloxone kits provided by Choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| Health Network. And we've also continued supplying people with contraceptive and emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| contraceptive. And these are only a few things that we've been doing while providing mutual aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| And while distributing essential supplies to folks, we asked them what they wanted shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| the most at the city council meeting tonight. And one was that they have no food and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| are starving while the city continues to not help them. And they also have nowhere to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| bathroom with businesses being shut down. Therefore, a lot of people are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| sick and dying from hunger. So, we asked them what they wanted shared the most at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| with businesses being shut down. Therefore, a lot of people are getting sick because they have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| place to wash their hands. So, FACT is a small autonomous collective of about 10 people. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| not a charity. We're not huge. We see people for people and are only doing what we do because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| system is failing people. And while forming these relationships with houseless folks, we have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| connections with a few EMTs whom say there have been about a 400% increase in overdoses since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| pandemic really started to hit Knoxville. They also shared that they've been instructed to drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4530)|

| 1:15:47| city. The recorded numbers of overall cases, the number of those that have recovered, and the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| of those who have died because of COVID-19, unfortunately, most likely do not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| those that are unsheltered because they continue to be treated badly by the police and even some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| doctors or they don't have a form of transportation to get to testing. So, if the city actually put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| money into social services instead of putting $700,000 of the mayor's budget towards the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| Knoxville Zoo, instead of putting $90,000 towards the Election Commission, and instead of continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| increasing the budget for the police, less people would be getting sick and less people would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| dying. FACT has seen firsthand, FACT, First Aid Collective Knoxville, has seen firsthand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| effects that the pandemic has put on our houseless neighbors and other vulnerable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| So, I'm saying the city must put funds into social services. Houseless people need food resources and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| they need bathroom resources with running water. And lastly, I would like to add to read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4605)|

| 1:17:32| The reality is Knoxville has zero out of these six conditions as Knox County has decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| suspend free coronavirus testing on Wednesday because they don't have the supplies. If the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| city isn't able to demand more supplies, which was stated earlier, then more money must be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4663)|

| 1:17:55| to houseless communities, incarcerated people, etc. to reduce that harm. Restrictions like safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4675)|

| 1:18:29| more appropriate for public forum. This is not a committee report, and I encourage you to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=4709)|

| 1:49:45| this proposed structure and standards thoroughly and cleanly and be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6585)|

| 1:50:01| I think there's a lot of desire to get this decided sooner than later, and so I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6601)|
| 1:50:12| we need the 120 days anymore. I think we can amend that to 90 days. I know that Councilperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6612)|
| 1:50:20| Ryder is on this as well, so I would make that motion that we can change this to 90 days as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6620)|
| 1:50:28| opposed to 120 based on those assurances, but I'm available to answer questions or if Councilperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6628)|
| 1:50:37| Ryder is in agreement with that as well. Let's see if there's a second on the motion to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| from 120-day moratorium to 90 days. That's the motion to amend on the floor. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| I'll second the motion to amend the time. Okay, motion made to amend by Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| seconded by Councilwoman Ryder. Ms. Fugate, do you have a question about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| Mm-hmm. Mayor, so just a logistical question. Why do we need to amend the motion down to 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6662)|
| 1:51:12| if it came back before us and we voted on it to institute it? Would that negate the necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| of the 120? Maybe that's a legal question. Andrew, you're the attorney. I assume you knew that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| you made that, but for us lay folks, I would think we could have left it alone and just come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| back sooner. And to answer your question, I don't think this is a legal answer. It's more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6691)|
| 1:51:40| pressure answer. What we had found in the 120 days is, you know, hey, that seems like a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6700)|
| 1:51:48| and so it didn't really get dealt with, but if we do it shorter...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| This is a motivator. Go ahead, sorry. This is a motivator. Yes, so I think that's it. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| the issue is if we don't get to a place where it can be reviewed in that 90 days, then we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| always come back and do this. The other thing to keep in mind is that the stakeholders is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| this up tomorrow, and so it would be really good to hear from them. And, yeah, so that's why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| 90 days. It doesn't prevent us from dealing with something in the future, though. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| just that's fine. You answered my question. It's really, we think we can be done sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| and it's also an incentive to keep it moving. Thank you. City Council Attorney Rob Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| is asked to be recognized. Mr. Frost? Actually, the way the moratorium is 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6751)|
| 1:52:41| but it can be changed by later ordinance to shorten the time if necessary. It's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6761)|
| 1:52:52| for both this one and the next one, I believe. Thank you, Mr. Frost. Any other questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6772)|
| 1:52:59| the amendment, which is changing it from 120 to 90 days moratorium? Seeing no questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6779)|

| 1:53:48| Okay. I need to know where you end, not where you start. Okay, 9-0. Now back to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6828)|

| 1:55:29| seconded by Councilwoman Ryder. Discussion? Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| Thank you, Mayor. Likewise, this is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| 120-day moratorium that was enacted back in December. Again, in those conversations I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| mentioned in the previous item, there's been discussions about that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| this needs to be brought cleanly in front of Council for a vote. There is still more study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| being needed here, so I'm comfortable based on those discussions and those assurances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| we can probably accomplish this in 90 days and to be able to do that with maintaining some level of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6963)|
| 1:56:13| you know, I don't know, helping to move things along, I think, as we've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| So I think the 90 days is appropriate in this instance as well as the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| So I'd make a motion that we change it from 120 days to 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| as well keeping in mind that we can come back and change this again later if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| Okay, I'll second that motion. Motion made to amend it from 120 to 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=6994)|

| 1:58:28| I don't see your name in the pool. If you phoned in, you can hit star nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| and we can recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7115)|

| 1:59:00| Mr. Hayes, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| Yes. Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| We can. So go ahead and you'll have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| to start by stating your name and address. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| Okay. My name is David Hayes with the 1312 Hawthorne Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| and I signed up to also speak at the budget item 9A when y'all was passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7160)|
| 1:59:27| the new budget items concerning the Nox Zoo. So I'm disappointed that my name wasn't called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| That was my fault, Mr. Hayes. I apologize. I dismissed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| Yeah. Well, thank you so much for the apology. I know y'all wouldn't want to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| opposing the silence. I appreciate the apology. I just wanted to start off by stating some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| dynamics within today's agenda. We had, of course, the $700,000 given to the Noxville Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| and we had over $1 million given to the Noxville Police Department, and we had only $32,000 going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7196)|
| 2:00:04| to social services in the form of community empowerment. So just to hit on the zoo dynamic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7204)|
| 2:00:11| you know, I know it was said a lot that the city doesn't want to be in the zoo business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| Therefore, we had to give this money over. But, you know, the zoo had other strings of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| income it could have actually dipped into, right? And the question of we don't want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| whether we should be in the zoo business or not, that's sort of actually being fleshed out. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| should have actually been studied. You know, we should have actually studied the pros and cons of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| what that would look like. You know, maybe the city could actually be more efficient, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| Maybe the city can make sure the workers are paid a living wage, you know, and maybe the city can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| make sure that the east side actually had a say in how the zoo impacts their community. So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| was a whole discussion there that could have been had, but wasn't. And in terms of $1 million to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| Noxville Police Department, you know, we continually fund, we continually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| don't fund the root causes, you know, in solving the root causes. And that's reflected in only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| $32,000 going to community empowerment. So those are the wrong priorities. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| revenue is going down in the city, we want to make sure that we don't see any austerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| right? We don't want to see crumbs going to social services and housing, and we need to see those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| things prioritized. Because as things get rougher, social services and resources are actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| to be even more important. And I know there is a lot of, you know, we have our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| we have some hands behind our back, honestly, because of the way our state government is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| overreaching into local government. So there's actually been a statewide coalition of over 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| groups, community groups, labor groups, political groups, come together and set forth some demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| for our governor. And I wanted to uplift those to let the city know that there are people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| are actually pushing back against what's going on at the state level. And we don't just have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| follow the lead of the state. We don't have to follow the lead of the county. We can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| be leaders ourselves, and we can actually push back against what harms us and promotes what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| actually good for our communities. So I'm just going to highlight the six demands that came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| this group. And the demands are titled, this is an open letter to Tennessee state and local elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| leaders about the COVID-19 response. Stand-up Nashville released this. But as I said, over 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| groups across the state endorsed it. So the first, so the first demand of the state is to allow local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| government to make sure all employees in their county have paid sick time so they don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| choose between public health and paying the bills. Second would be to allow local governments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| expand the criteria for the property tax freeze program while they confront the budget shortfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| caused by adherence to social distancing and the latest public health guidelines so they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| protect people who have lost their jobs. Third, to ensure immigrant communities feel safe interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| with local health departments and other government agencies so local communities can keep all their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| residents safe and healthy. Fourth, allow local governments to prioritize the creation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| employment opportunities for local residents on public projects. Five, allow local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| to ensure that businesses they contract with are providing good jobs that boost the local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7393)|

| 2:04:27| He is in the pool. I have enabled him to speak. He is still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| I believe he joined the meeting by Zoom, so he should be able to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7473)|

| 2:05:21| Yes. Okay. Mr. Roach, if you could just start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| and you'll have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| Yes, this is Rick Roach, 24th floor, Victoria, Knoxville, Tennessee. I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| Well, not a question. I want to bring something to council's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| as regards priorities, future priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| The city of Knoxville has multiple relationships with multiple financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7546)|
| 2:06:02| And going forward, because of the peculiar situation that we're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| I would hope that city council would try not to do business as usual in terms of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7570)|
| 2:06:29| housing is addressed, especially in terms of the financial institutions and the roles that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| they have to play in facilitating any type of housing justice here in Knoxville. In particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7595)|
| 2:06:46| I would ask that there be a focus on when you're dealing with any particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7606)|
| 2:06:54| entering into any type of relationship with the financial institution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| no matter what has happened in the past in terms of a working relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| that you really start to look at the financial institutions and the record that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| overall in terms of housing and the people that they have historically excluded or underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7632)|
| 2:07:23| As an example, more than likely, we have several financial institutions that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7643)|
| 2:07:33| may have done business with in the past in different ways that openly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7653)|
| 2:07:41| some of them got caught, some of them didn't, some of them entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7661)|
| 2:07:49| a type of compensatory relationship once they got caught, a consent decree or whatever you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7669)|
| 2:07:56| call it, but they discriminated against particular groups of people, primarily people of African| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| descent, primarily people of low to moderate income, and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7684)|
| 2:08:14| to my understanding still has a strong relationship, strong relationships with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| entities. So I would ask that you start to look at and keep in mind some of the things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7700)|
| 2:08:28| required in terms of national regulations, federal regulations, such as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7708)|

| 2:08:56| any type of relationship with them in the future that they are doing their damndest to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7736)|
| 2:09:06| with all regulations and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| non-discriminatory provisions. We've had financial institutions in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7752)|
| 2:09:19| even though they don't like the word, they have pretty much invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| themselves into the process of redlining. Mr. Rush, you have one minute to go. All right, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7767)|
| 2:09:36| with that knowledge, as you proceed forward now, because this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| perilous time as we start to, quote, get back on track, that you not do business as usual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7783)|
| 2:09:52| that these institutions are made to account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| for themselves, and if they come up lacking, if they show to be lacking, don't do business with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| and have them comply. If they're underserving a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| you know, and this information can be acquired, okay, it's not hard to come by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7813)|
| 2:10:21| and, you know, you should be focusing on that in order to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| all the underserved communities in Knoxville have access to capital, whether it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200421?start=7828)|
