| 0:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| And that is the, just for the audience, that is the issue of the fence at the safety building, the perimeter project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=154)|
| 0:02:45| We are postponing it for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=165)|

| 0:03:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Those are the 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=191)|

| 0:03:14| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| For the Mayor's report, I want to just thank our TDOT Commissioner, John Schroer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| He and many of his staff members were here in Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| We are one of the stops along the way for a bus tour that he has embarked upon to meet with local officials, local staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=209)|
| 0:03:39| Councilwoman Palmer was there, along with a lot of other elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| And staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| And we actually took a tour over to the Henley Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| And Vice Mayor Pavlis, you'll be glad to know that it is on schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| We were told that June 30th is still the opening date of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| And then we went over to Western Avenue to see the road projects, the widening of Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| both the future plans and then the current widening that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| So we appreciate him being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| I also want to just remind everybody that tomorrow early voting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Tomorrow is Wednesday, October 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| And then that starts tomorrow at the early voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| We want to encourage you to go to the very end of the ballot where there is a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| There are seven county charter amendments, one through seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| And then after that is the city charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| And that is the pension reform plan, which this council spent many months debating, dialoguing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| and put a final proposal on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| And we're asking that you support that so that we can reduce our future costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| and we can at the same time have a competitive package for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| so we can recruit and retain our police officers and our firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| So that is the last item on the ballot for city voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Also, Vice Mayor Pavlis and I will be participating Thursday night here in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| in a forum with the League of Women Voters in which they will be discussing all the charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| We'll talk about the city charter and then there are some representatives, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| from the Charter Commission for the county who will be talking about their seven items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| That's at 7 o'clock here in this room on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| And finally, I also want to invite all of you out tomorrow at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| I will be delivering a brown bag, green book presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| something that the library has been sponsoring for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| which is really a great forum in which somebody is invited to come and do basically a book report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| a review of a book dealing with green development, green issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| And the book that I'll be reviewing is called Emerald Cities by Joan Fitzgerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| and it's about how sustainability and economic development go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| So that is at 12 noon tomorrow at the East Tennessee History Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| And that is all for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| I want to proudly announce that the habitat, wildlife habitats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| kind of a subgroup of the South Woodlawn Neighborhood Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| has been awarded a $30,000 grant from Dow Chemical, which is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| What this entails is it's going to be what they're calling a labitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| where it will be an amphitheater, and it will be on the hillside overlooking Baker Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| and a 50-foot section of the creek will be intentionally planted with native species to create the labitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| And so, you know, obviously they'll be able to really help the students outside with a hands-on approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| and I'm sure there will be other opportunities for the community to probably take advantage of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| But I particularly wanted to call out Kathy Hitchcock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| She is the one that really was the brainchild behind this and really the energy behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| And my hat goes off to her because she did a really good job in the face of adversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| There's a lot of people that really go after a $30,000 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| And with her leadership, we were able to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| And my hat's off, too, to Legacy Parks for being the fiscal agent for this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| So the project will begin later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| It obviously goes right hand-in-hand with the outdoor theme that we have created in the First District in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| So congratulations to that neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Great. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| The early voting location that was formerly near the Expo Center in the Third District has now been moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| and I think a lot of people aren't aware of that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| And it's at the corner of Shod Road and Clinton Highway in a shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| There's a pizza place on one side and a cell phone place on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| I don't want to give them a shameless plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| But if those people who live in the Norwood area, Inskip, Lonsdale, Cumberland Estates are looking for that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=504)|
| 0:08:34| it has moved, and the move has not been particularly well publicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| We don't have any elections and confirmations, so ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| Nine A's in ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2012-2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Councilman Del Voco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| I wanted to move to divide the question, as we did the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| I thought maybe it would stay divided, but it did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| We could have the Sertoma Center budget change first, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| Okay, there's a motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=555)|

| 0:09:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| That's just on the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| That's to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| And now do you want to make a motion to approve Sertoma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Yeah, I want to make a motion to approve the Sertoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| We have a motion and a second to approve the Sertoma grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| And now it would be a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Okay, the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Councilman Del Voco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Yes, I'm not going to belabor this because I think I know where the votes stand based on our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| I just, again, want to reiterate that even though this is a good project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| and people are looking forward to seeing development of that site where there were some environmental challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| I still think it's inappropriate for us to be giving taxpayer dollars to a single developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| We're not doing Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| We're not doing another district like Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| We are picking a single project and taking taxpayer dollars to help them with infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| We already provided the TIF of $10 million to help with infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| and I don't think it's appropriate for us to go in deeper, but I know my colleagues disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| I would say that I don't think there's a limiting principle here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| and I wonder when the next person comes with a request for taxpayer funds, how you say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| and how you distinguish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| So I'm going to vote against it, but I'll just keep my remaining thoughts to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I want to make two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| One is that we say no a lot, and we'll continue to say no a lot when there are proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| that we don't think are appropriate to bring before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And secondly, I want to remind everybody that this is for public infrastructures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| for the roads and the bridge as part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| It is the last in money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Maybe it won't be needed, but it's the last in money, and it's only if necessary at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121016?start=681)|
