| 0:02:28| It's simply to give the parties more time to discuss it and for us to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=148)|

| 0:04:05| First, I would like to start my Mayor's Report with a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| for the victims of the horrible crime in Buffalo, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| So if you'd just bow your heads for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=252)|
| 0:04:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| We have a long agenda despite the recent things that were postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| We have a lot of very important topics on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| so I will try to keep my report brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| First, I just wanted, since we have so many employees here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| to start with something that I heard about that happened this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| One of our residents, Sterling Hinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Mr. Hinton, are you in the office this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| I mean, not the office, the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| If you could just come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I just want to hear your story in one minute or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| If you could just share a little bit about what your experience was this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| and we're glad to see you here today alive and well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| I'm glad to be here, Madam Mayor, me in one minute or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| You can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Well, I had an allergic reaction to shellfish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| and I always knew I had this allergic reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| but I never had a reaction like I had this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| And I was doing an event at the World's Fair site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| and luckily I had a friend who I've known for over 25 years, Kent Cozart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| who convinced me to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| I'm from the school where, you know, we fight through everything and finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| At the same time, I'm thinking like I'm turning into an alien right in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| I'm unrecognizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| I'm swelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Then I realized I couldn't talk, and those that know me, imagine me not talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| But he convinced me to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| So we agreed to let him help me, and we were on our way to UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| And in the meantime, as I came down the elevator and got to his car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| I got critically worse to where I couldn't see now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| So he kept his wits about him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Sterling, we're going to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| I said, the fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| He banged on the garage door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| I was hoping they would let us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| They let us in, and I tell you, the fire department at that fire station right by the World's Fair site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| to be honest with you, saved my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| I couldn't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| I couldn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| I couldn't talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And there's a picture floating around of me inside the ambulance that people have known me for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| and I was unrecognizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| They acted swiftly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| They acted professionally and gave me the IV, EpiPen, oxygen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=418)|
| 0:07:08| and treated me like a person in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| And because of their training and professionalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| I'm here speaking to everybody at this council meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| Thank you so much for sharing that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| And I understand it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| And the particular firefighters who saved your life that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Captain Jacob Mason, Senior Firefighter Jason Woodson, and Senior Firefighter Trace Langley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| So I don't know if they're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| But if you are, would you please stand up or raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=460)|

| 0:08:01| I also want to acknowledge that this week is Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Our Public Works employees do so much and sometimes without a lot of recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| because the work that they do saves lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| but not in a direct way as some of our police and firefighters and first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| So thank you to all the hardworking members of our Public Works team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=497)|

| 0:14:17| In that time period, I have not once seen a fire station closed due to a lack of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| And in decades prior to, I've never heard of a station being closed due to a lack of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| That's because the men and women of the Knoxville Fire Department are dedicated to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| We're simply asking for you to amend this year's budget and allow us to have a $2,000 retention bonus or gap pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=876)|

| 0:15:14| I know you guys sacrifice a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| These are not easy meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| I know you guys are going through a lot, and you've had your arms pulled off with one way to the next, people wanting this and wanting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| I won't go over the numbers again like I usually do, because I just sent you those yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| and so you guys know where we're at as far as staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And we have another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=935)|

| 0:15:43| Today, in about a two-hour period, I saw KPD answering calls, fire answering calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| I saw the vehicle shop give maintenance to my vehicle and work on my vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| I saw construction fixing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| I saw stormwater working, service department, signal shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| All these are city and Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| They're valuable assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| As my counterpart with fire just said, the $2,000 can go a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| That could mean somebody paying tuition for their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| That could mean a small vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| That could mean vehicle maintenance on their own car to get them back and forth to work to serve the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| So this $2,000 will be a good measure, and it is a good measure, and it's a good idea, and I'm asking that you support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=991)|

| 0:16:55| I speak in support of the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| So the things you're thinking about tonight really are, and I think I've talked to most of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1019)|
| 0:17:08| we're looking at really correcting kind of some long-term maybe issues that have been there for most of our employees for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1028)|
| 0:17:19| And then COVID has made that quite a bit harder, and so our folks are already behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| We've done survey after survey in years past, and we haven't really got there, and we kind of know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| So I look at this measure as a sort of a stopgap over what our employees have been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| You can't get on any news site or any website and not read about the measures employers are taking to retain employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1058)|
| 0:17:47| and the things that they're already doing in the workforce to keep people and attract people back into the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| Our employees are here. They've stuck with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| So I'd ask you to support this measure. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you, Officer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Next person is Steve King. Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, Mayor. Steve King, 6016 Apache Trail. I'm here representing the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1091)|
| 0:18:20| I'm addressing 9A and particularly the item about the bonus for all city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| I appreciate the mayor and thinking of employees in a time when we actually, as we learned from Ms. Juneau last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1107)|
| 0:18:37| that we actually exceeded our revenue projections during the COVID year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| I appreciate the insight that the mayor and her staff had to share that stroke of good luck with city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1122)|
| 0:18:51| so I urge you to support that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you. That concludes the people who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Just for clarification, Director Juneau, this item moves money into accounts to pay the employee bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1143)|
| 0:19:16| this one-time employee bonus, but it doesn't actually authorize the spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| It's just moving money into different accounts. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Yes, that's correct, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| And so we'll be authorizing this in 12D, if I'm looking at it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| Yes, 9D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Oh, 9D, not 12D. I'm sorry. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| I think we need to recognize the hard work of our city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and I think we've heard some very good comments about none of these stations going dark during the COVID times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1182)|
| 0:19:51| Rather than a one-time bonus, though, I really feel like these funds could have been better used to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| to address shortcomings in the current longevity pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| I think that would have been a better approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| But I'm going to vote to move these funds because I think it is a well-deserved retention bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| and I do believe there were better ways to accomplish retention, but this is a good one to vote for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1210)|
| 0:20:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Well, just along the same lines of what Council Member Roberto, the issue that Council Member Roberto raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1229)|
| 0:20:41| in our packets on a later agenda item, a part of the compensation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1241)|
| 0:20:49| there is a section that adds back in language about longevity payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1249)|
| 0:21:02| and it was brought to Council's attention that this section has not been updated in quite some decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1262)|
| 0:21:11| and so the rate for longevity payments is quite out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| And so my question would be, if we were to move the bonus pay from the section that is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1277)|
| 0:21:31| and allocate it towards longevity payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1291)|
| 0:21:41| and directed the administration to apply that funding towards longevity payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| would we be able to increase the amount that our more long-term employees receive through longevity payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1307)|
| 0:21:57| adding to our retention efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| Would we be able to increase longevity payments if we transfer the $2 million for bonuses over to longevity payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| So the existing longevity program is an annual allocation based on years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| So the amendment is approving a one-time payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So I think if Council had asked us to evaluate the current longevity program, which has recurring costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| we would need to step back and evaluate that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| But the amendment before you is for a one-time payment, not for recurring expenses long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| Okay, follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Was the longevity payment program reviewed under the comp study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| It was reviewed at a high level that it was a program that should stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| So reviewed at a high level means that the rate set under that program being set in the 1980s was not reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1370)|
| 0:23:01| What they said was the current longevity program should stay in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| and that we should adopt the compensation class comp plan that you had before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| So they did look at our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| They looked at longevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| And again, Dr. Drummond is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| They did not recommend changes to that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| I'll pause and see what other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| Okay, seeing no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| 9B is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments, agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and funds of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| and providing the authority to reappropriate non-project-related encumbrances at the end of fiscal year 21-22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| into fiscal year 22-23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Council members, some people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| We'll start with Sergeant Sam Hennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Sergeant Hennard, you're the first person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| My name is Sam Hennard, address of 800 Howard Baker Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| I'm an 18-year veteran of the Knoxville Police Department where I currently serve as the personnel director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| One of my duties in that role is to oversee the recruitment and hiring of all KPD employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| To say we have a hiring crisis in Knoxville is putting it mildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| As of today, we have 52 police officer openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Our job posting recently ended with 156 police officer applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| Today, we had 71 scheduled to test, and out of those 71, only 30 showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| Tomorrow, they canceled the testing because no one had scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Saturday, we have 80, and we pray that they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| If we base this number on what we've seen in the past, half of those will not even pass all phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| These low numbers cannot get us to full staffing, not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Just for reference, in 2011, I was the recruitment officer, and we had 1,001 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| And we were at full strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| A number of these things contributed to the hiring crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| and the mayor's proposed budget would tremendously help with one glaring factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| We are grossly underpaid when compared to other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Officers are leaving on a regular basis for higher-paying jobs at local police departments in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| Some are even leaving the profession altogether for higher-paying private sector jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| with significantly less stress and danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| The manpower issues have stretched our officers thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Patrol officers are now working very long 12-hour shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| and investigators are being assigned heavy caseloads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Then you add mandatory overtime to fill these shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Secondary employment jobs on every day off have become the norm for our men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| just so these officers can provide for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| But in turn, they don't even have time to be with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| These manpower issues are obviously causing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| The lateral entry program has been a great success for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Since its inception, we have hired 21 lateral officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| These officers chose Knoxville for a better way of life, a lower cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| However, with the cost of inflation and housing in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| it no longer makes financial sense for them to come here with our current pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| In 2020, the cost of a home in Knoxville was $192,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Today it is $394,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Yet our salaries are very similar to that of 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Most importantly, our employees, who are Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| have been outpriced and cannot afford to live within the city they love and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| with our current pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| We are not only law enforcement officers, but we are servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| We want to serve our community and assist those who have no one else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| But without more officers and higher salaries to keep the current officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| public safety is compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Our officers want to get back to the days where community engagement was the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| They could park their cars and get out and shoot basketball and hand out badges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| making positive relationships with those that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| But because of the major shortages, they go call to call to call for 12 hours, if not 14 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| The decisions this body has made sitting in these chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| have made Knoxville the vibrant and attractive city that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| People are coming from all over to live here and raise their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| The people sitting behind me who serve this city day and night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| have made this city the safe, clean, and welcoming city that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| We have all worked together to make Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| a top destination for a better way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| In order to keep Knoxville great and allow our own people to thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| we need you to continue making the right decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| and vote yes for the mayor's budget as it relates to better pay structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| and higher salaries for all Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1702)|

| 0:28:29| I think they're clapping for Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| That was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| Just to piggyback off of what Sam says, we're servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Everybody you see sitting here is servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| That's what we do. We're a service industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| You serve the people. We serve the people in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| You're decision makers. We have to live with your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| And hopefully that decision is the one that will benefit the folks in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| the folks that couldn't make it, the folks that serve the city of Knoxville every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| One of the people that I saw working today was a guy fixing a sidewalk with a jackhammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| I thought, I don't know how much he makes, but I know he needs more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I know he deserves more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| The employees of Knoxville deserve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| They deserve your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| The next person signed up to speak is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1768)|
| 0:29:42| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I just ask that you support the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| A budget is just a written document that represents your priorities as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| or any organization and what you're investing in and value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| What you have behind you are professionals that provide service to our citizens that they expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| We need your help to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Probably now more than any time in my 20-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| I don't know what it is, like 24-something now, at the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I can say we probably need that support more than ever now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| So I'd ask you to vote in support of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I'm not going to take a lot of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| I'd ask you to vote in support of your state of values of public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| and good public service and help us provide that to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Next is Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Steve King, 6016 Apache Trail, here representing the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| I really am impressed that you all always look at me when I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| So I know you're listening, and employees appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| and we appreciate the fact that you're considering the budget as proposed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| We support that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| We look forward to the approval of the budget and the new compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| and appreciate the time you spent studying that, asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| and look forward to the vote as we move on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Next person speaking in favor is Joel Goucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| Mr. Goucher, come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| State your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Joel Goucher, 4701 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Leading a municipality is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| You have to balance the needs of the taxpayers versus the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and what they receive for that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| There's value in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| And I'm here to encourage you to support this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| because I believe the value in what is received by the citizens, the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| the businesses within the city of Knoxville is more than enough for what is provided in the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1938)|
| 0:32:29| We have provided value for decades for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| The council, the mayors have kept costs low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| It's part of the reason why the city of Knoxville has achieved certain levels of rankings on great places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| It's been a nationally recognized municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Because costs are low, it's a great place to raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| So I'm here today to encourage you to support this so that the citizens continue to receive the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| for what their tax dollars are spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| It's always difficult to vote in favor of a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| It's like the third rail of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| But there are times when that particular choice needs to be made so that, as has been mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| we're struggling to hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| As was mentioned a minute ago, a thousand people signed up for the police academy at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| not that far in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Same happened with the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| When I tested here 20 years ago for a job with this fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| we had to test over two days because there were so many people that desired this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| The last time we tested, I don't believe we had the hundreds and hundreds of applicants that we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| And there's part of the reasons that are many, and there's a lot of layers to why those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| But I do believe that the solution is found in part in the budget that's being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2039)|
| 0:34:08| and the future for the fire and police and the city at large that's being laid out for the next 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| to allow us to recruit better employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| There's nobody that I can think of that's better trained, that's more experienced, and does a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| I'm speaking from the fire department because that's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| We give our best every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| It doesn't matter whether there's storms or whatever the case is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| We give our best, and we would appreciate if you guys would recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| and encourage you to support this measure and help us to continue the trend of the best here day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Thank you, Mr. Goucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| The final speaker on this agenda item is Commissioner Larson Jay speaking against the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Larson Jay, 8407 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| I come before you tonight as a Knoxville resident and a concerned taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| We're right in the middle of an economic crisis, and this proposed budget and tax rate increase only makes things worse for the average citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| Every day, the people of Knoxville are facing higher gas prices to get to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| higher prices at the grocery store to feed their family, more expensive medicine to care for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| and skyrocketing home values along with an overwhelming property tax assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| that threaten many people who constantly fear for being priced out of their own homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| It's a tough time right now for many, but this proposed budget and tax increase does not reflect the current reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| Every business owner and every household knows when you spend more than you make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| you can't just always go ask for a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| You also have to cut your expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Experience tells us that there are times when you push forward with improvements, ideas, and initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| and there are times when you pull back, take a breath, and you assess things later in the process when the time is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| When I read the budget proposal, it amazed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| There were virtually no descriptions that didn't include the words increases or exceeds the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| What concerns me the most is when I read a recent report about the proposed spending budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| that if adopted is projected to only last three more years before the money runs out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| and you'll have to go back to the taxpayers and ask for another tax increase once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| This is a spending plan that is not sustainable and does not reflect prudent fiscal management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| In a time where virtually every person in our community is trimming their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| watching their spending, and doing what they can to combat ever-rising inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| please don't rubber stamp this plan and endorse this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| that doesn't appear to be doing anything to find financial savings, to cut back on expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| or find ways to defer ever-rising costs to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| This is not the time for the largest tax increase in Knoxville's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| You have the opportunity tonight to stand up for the citizens of this great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| You can reject this budget and send it back for revisions and demand cuts, demand efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| demand that our government do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| You have the power to reduce the proposed tax increase to a more moderate level, sustainable level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| and focus all your efforts on supporting the most vital services, police, fire, first responders, public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| Go all in on the folks right here behind me, but then look at the rest of the line items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| and prioritize them one at a time just like every business does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Look at the real needs, not just the wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Tighten the belt, give people some relief, and move the nice-to-have projects back a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| until economic conditions improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| In the recent city elections, it was continuously touted that Knoxville was in good financial shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| If you approve this, as is, what will you say in three years when the money runs out and you have to ask for more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| When you make your budget decision tonight, please just ask yourself three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Is this budget and proposed tax increase excessive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Does this budget reflect the absolutely necessary priorities of our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| And has this administration made every single effort to be the most efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| and effective operation before asking for more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| This is not the time for the largest tax increase in Knoxville's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| I'd like to just share a few thoughts before you start your conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| First, I want to thank all of Council for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| I know you've had an extensive legislative budget hearing last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| and I think there was a lot of good discussion there, a lot of good questions asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| I also think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I appreciate Commissioner Jay for sharing his thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| I know he's recently moved to the city, so he may not be familiar with our priorities and values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| but we believe in supporting affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| We believe in supporting the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| We believe in paying for professional first responders that serve everybody regardless of ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| And we believe in paying our employees a fair market wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| and not just saying things that we say are nice, putting our money where our mouth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| So I'm really proud of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I'm really proud of what it contains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| It's essential services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| This is not fluff in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| It's about crucial, essential, core services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| We heard about the life-saving services that just helped a resident this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| That happens every day, all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| And our public service and public works employees are no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| They are keeping our streets smooth and paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| They're preventing us from having floods and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| So I know that the people of Knoxville value those services and expect us to pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| As far as efficiencies, we've discussed many times how our employees are doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| And anyone who's worked for any organization at all knows that the definition of productivity is people doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| And that's what our employees have been doing, not just the last couple of years, but for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| So I'm grateful for the hard work of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| The residents of Knoxville expect and rely on those crucial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| And I'm really proud to be supporting those crucial, essential services in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Also, just a point of respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I'd also like to commend our finance team for the AAA bond rating that we continuously get and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2451)|
| 0:41:04| And it just got improved this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| So thank you to our CFO, Susan Janot, and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And part of getting good bond ratings and having a good fiscal stewardship is good fiscal policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| And that means from time to time, just like Mayor Victor Ash, just like Mayor and then Governor Bill Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| and just like my predecessor, Madeline Rojero, from time to time, the people of Knoxville want the services to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| We raise taxes to cover those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| And that's what this budget includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| So I want to thank everybody for putting together this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| I want to thank our employees for all the hard work and for sticking with this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| Even though you've been paid well below market for decades, we're trying to catch up and make up for lost time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| Because this is an acute issue in the housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| It's an acute issue in the labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| And we cannot afford to disregard our responsibility in maintaining these crucial services for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| We're at a tipping point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| And I'll just repeat a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I know you council members have heard these many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Our population is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Building permits are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Residents are calling on city services more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Police calls alone are up 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| So just a reminder, police calls are up 12%, and we're down more than 50 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And 100 of them could retire either tomorrow or really soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| We also face skyrocketing inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| We all are seeing it in our grocery store bills, in our gas bills, and other bills that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| The city of Knoxville has to pay those bills, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| We can't say, oh, I'm sorry, firefighters and police officers, you're going to have to not respond to calls for service today because gas is too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| We have an acute number of unfilled positions across departments, public service, fleet, police, fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| This spring, as you all know, we could not recruit enough qualified applicants to hold a police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| That does not bode well for the public safety of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I'm not willing to sacrifice Knoxville's safety and quality of life by being penny-wise and pound-foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| So this budget is all about high-quality core services and the infrastructure to keep Knoxville's positive momentum going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| This decision to raise taxes was not made lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| But we have to be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And so anyhow, I know I'm saying things that you've heard many times, and so I'm going to stop my remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| and let you guys have your discussion about this, and I'll pipe in as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| You know, I've spent a lot of time with this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I've scrutinized it, I've reviewed it, I've looked at it every which way I can, and I'm going to support this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| A budget ultimately needs to spend money wisely, take care of workers, and provide good services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| And at its core, the foundation of our city is providing those services for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| It's clear that we're in an employment crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| We either are going to adjust to the current labor market or we're going to have to eliminate services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| All employers are experiencing the same demands that the labor market's putting on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| and the city's not immune from those pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| During our budget hearings, we learned that the private sector has increased advertised wages by 12% in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| Overall, the compensation package that's a part of this budget is talking about a 10% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| During the budget hearings, we learned that there were $166 million of requests put in by the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2686)|
| 0:44:55| for needed, necessary things in this budget, but only about half of those were funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| Why were only about half of those funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Because those deferred items are all important, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| but delaying their implementation creates space for a new competitive compensation package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2708)|
| 0:45:17| Just for some examples, we heard a lot about public safety, and I'll talk about that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2717)|
| 0:45:26| But if you drive down any of our business corridors right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| you'll see job openings for beginning wages at $15, $16 an hour and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| Public service starts at $12 an hour right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| In the labor market, that's not going to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| It's not going to fill the 50 vacancies in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| What we're talking about funding here is funding for starting those at $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| This budget funds brush and leaf pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| It fills potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| It sweeps streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| It mows and maintains right-of-ways, parks, shoulders of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| and it maintains our public facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| Similarly, police recruits start at $17 an hour currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| In this labor market, that's not going to fill 52 open seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| And just as the mayor said earlier, we've got another 50 who could retire tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| This item funds starting KPD officer or recruits at $20 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| It funds getting back to full staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| It gets off of dangerous 12-hour shifts and gets back to community policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| like we just heard from some of the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| not having to jump from one call to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| It also funds our firefighters so they're not on 96-hour shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| and they can more effectively and efficiently respond to emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2816)|
| 0:47:04| Ultimately, I think we're going to have to look at some additional deferrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| and capital projects that may be needed to secure this policy for a long time to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| but we can't not act now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| The cost of inaction is unacceptable, and so I'm supporting this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Yeah, so some of you were here the other day, many of the folks sitting up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| and we spent a lot of time going through, I think Vice Mayor Roberto had a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| My recollection from the other day was $79 million in cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| and belt tightening that didn't make the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| I do have some questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| But first I'm going to say I am going to support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| We're putting a lot of emphasis talking about salaries and wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| and pay to retain and fully staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| but a part of the tax increase and a part of the budget is the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| that people are constantly calling us for and asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| So I'd like to ask Director Cannon a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| I'm going to pick on you, not specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| but because a lot of the capital improvements and things that we fund that come out of the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| I've had a lot of constituents asking me where we can cut and where we can curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| Some of that, of course, is in this packet that we went through on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| About how much are we not funding, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| I know one of the questions I specifically asked you was what are we putting in the sidewalks in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| and what are we not able to fund that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| So we'll just talk about sidewalks for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Sidewalks that get kids to school within the walkability parental responsibility zone around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| I know you don't have that drilled down to a number, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Yes, ma'am. Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Forgive me, I don't have this current fiscal year's number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| but I believe sidewalks is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| I think we were pushing right at a million dollars for this current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| When the budget came out, we were asked to make cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| and one of those cuts was in the sidewalk program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and the amount city dollars invested in there was $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| What we're most fortunate about and what you see on page 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| a lot of the dollars there that's allowing us to do these projects are not city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| We were able to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| You still have ARPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| You have TDAC dollars for water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| We were able to take $750,000 of those grant dollars as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| and put that towards our sidewalk program for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| It's going to take some creativity to meet the grant requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| but we're committed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| That's one of many that was a significant cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| Near and dear to Councilwoman Singh's heart, Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| We had that on our list of projects that we had hoped to do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| We just cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| We really have no new roadway projects, if you will, coming before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3022)|
| 0:50:31| We have cut back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| On the operations side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| I had the same number of people in our permitting division that I had in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| and the number of permits has tripled since then from 1,000 to 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| They're busting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| They're busting it big time to get those permits out in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| I hope I'm beginning to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| What's the impact of not getting the permits out in a timely manner with the staff that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| If we don't, that delays construction, which delays completion of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| which delays tax revenues to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| They have committed to the turnaround on the initial review of being 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| It's getting tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| It's getting very, very tough with the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| But they're making it happen through overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| And in conversations with you, like repairs to existing sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| I believe we have hundreds of miles of existing 100-year-old sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| I think this budget has $250,000 in it for those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| And how much sidewalk does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| That's a great question, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| And I guess it depends on the section how much we have to take out and what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| It is a dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| It's not a very noticeable dent, except to our folks who have particularly mobility problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| or folks who use those sidewalks that are currently trip hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| We've got them throughout the city, and we can't fix them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| There's no way they can all be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| So we have come up with a prioritization process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| particularly where mobility issues are evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| We try to take care of those first, and we spend every nickel of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| One more large-ticket item, stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| What are we funding there, and what are we not funding there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| That's probably the best news I can bring this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| is that if you look at past fiscal year budgets, very little has gone to storm sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| And even since in my two-year run here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| how many times have we come to you with an emergency resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| to correct something on one of our streams, or we have a pipe that's about to collapse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| We had $100,000 in pipe remediation, which is nothing these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| That is a significant – how can I put this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| We get a significant boost in our opportunity to truly address storm infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| through these TDEC dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| It's a surge that we haven't seen in years, and so we're using grant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| Council Member Ryder, if I could interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Those dollars through the TDEC are thanks to the bipartisan federal infrastructure bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| and that's how – we don't get it directly to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| It's coming through the state, and that's, like Director Cannon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| it's going to make a huge difference in our ability to be more resilient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| as we deal with floods and other things, and just eroding, corroding pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| I get a lot of phone calls about stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| so the Fountain City area suffers greatly from stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| much of it coming from outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| It is something that's been a great need here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| and I'm excited about the fact that we do have these grant dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| because based on just city dollars, we wouldn't be able to make much of a dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| So we're leveraging our small amount of our budget for that towards federal and state funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Okay. I'm going to let my other fellow colleagues talk some –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I mean, I could sit here and go through every department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| but I decided to pick on you for a moment, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| We've spent a lot of time during the budget discussions focusing on the salary increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| because it's a significant impact to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| And in addition to wanting to make sure that the lowest paid employees are prioritized in that salary increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3283)|
| 0:54:54| my other concern continues to be how we are taking care of our residents here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3294)|
| 0:55:02| And as we've gone through this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| and we've seen a significant level of federal dollars flowing into our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| I continue to be concerned with how those dollars have been prioritized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| and not enough concern for our affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| We could have used more ARPA funding towards that affordable housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| and we certainly could allocate more in this budget to those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| And so I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I have concerns about the projected plans for East Knoxville and economic development in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3339)|
| 0:55:50| who those plans will actually benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| And I have concerns about the salary increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| and whether we'll actually meet our goals of that intended salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| I am worried that we'll have to come back here, you know, if I'm here three years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| and either the leadership in place at that moment will either have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| suspend this compensation plan or propose another tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| I'm also concerned that we are being given very conservative figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| and it is hard to understand how a lot of investments may materialize over the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3392)|
| 0:56:40| increasing our particularly sales tax, but also property taxes that the city is able to take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3400)|
| 0:56:52| So there's a lot to weigh in these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| For me, I'm not at a place where I feel comfortable supporting this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| I support the salary increase, but I feel like we have to do more for our residents of this city who are trying to recover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3423)|
| 0:57:13| and we have money coming in from the federal government to support those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| But I don't see the money going to those in most need in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| I see it going to those most likely to turn out and vote, but that's not how we should make our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| We need to make our decisions based on who has the most need in our city and what these dollars can address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| and we're just simply not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I am horrified that we have not set down on the money already allocated for non-congregate shelter, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3459)|
| 0:57:49| for those experiencing homelessness in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| Instead, we're investing money into clearing encampments and chasing folks all around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| I think the last figure I heard was somewhere around $300,000 a year that we're spending just clearing encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| when we could be putting folks into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| So I'm not able to support this budget, but I congratulate you all on your salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3489)|
| 0:58:18| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| I've already stated and proven during my time on council that I am and I have always been a promoter, a defender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3503)|
| 0:58:32| and steadfastly supportive of our law enforcement as well as our fire department, our frontline workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| including Public Works and other dedicated city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| So my decision to not support tax increase and therefore the budget is not synonymous with me not supporting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3523)|
| 0:58:52| As a member of city council, I took an oath to represent all residents of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| and it is my fiduciary responsibility to be a good steward of our tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| to be mindful of the economy and the current impact it's having on people and their quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| and to, above all, to look holistically at issues from a 360 perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| I've been a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| I'm an employer of 95 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| While there are many variables aside from pay that factor into hiring and retaining employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| I believe in taking care of your people by compensating them fairly and competitively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| because people are any business's greatest asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| That's why I wholeheartedly supported the compensation study, and I will support it again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| But I also have to manage my dollars within the confines of a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| and reprioritize if needed in order to ensure I'm also meeting the core operating needs of my organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| The other issue we're dealing with now is that we have more jobs and people to fill them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| which creates desperate measures resulting in even greater wage competitiveness and incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| which I then have to question how businesses can weather the long-term sustainability of that type of overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| and then what happens when we hit a recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| As I said two weeks ago, every family in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| is already dealing with double-digit inflation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| and feeling the impact of skyrocketing costs of just about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Business owners have experienced revenue loss because of pipeline issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| yet their overhead costs continue to increase because they're paying to retain employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| they're paying inflationary costs, and now increased property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Others I know are looking for new places to live because of rising rents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| and when 53% of city residents are renters in a market with already critically low inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| that becomes a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| We know people are already having to make decisions, as we've heard, between groceries, rent, medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| and our commuting workforce is incurring record gas prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| So, you know, it may sound conflicting, but at the same time, for all of these reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| I simply can't justify creating more hardship for people who are already struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3678)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| I would just say that our budget and the services that the city provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| is something that people who are struggling heavily rely on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| whether it's first responders or our parks or our resilience and pavement and stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| and all the things that we do for the city are exactly the kind—our CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| These are the things that the people struggling with their bills also need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| and that's what this budget is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| This has been a hard day, lots of conversations, but I want to talk about how much—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| most of the people that have called me are very confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| this being done in a time when we're looking at house values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| Can somebody explain what does this translate into in dollars per year, per month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| How will it affect our pockets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Yeah, I'll answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| I'll go back to this graphic, which is my favorite graphic that we've generated in this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| For someone whose home is appraised at $100,000, the cost will be an extra $10 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| For someone whose home is appraised at $200,000, it'll be $20 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| $20 a month for paying our first responders a fair market wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| $20 a month for paying the people who keep our streets clean and safe, $20 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| For someone whose home is appraised at $500,000, appraised at $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| those are people who—you know, those are pretty expensive homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| The monthly increase will be $52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| And just so you know, I brought my own reappraisal, the yellow sheet that all Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| and just as a reminder, all city residents pay their county taxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| Just like, you know, everyone at this table pays both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| And we don't have control over the reappraisal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| That's a county issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| And the fact that that's happening at the same year that we're doing this is also out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| I didn't include a tax increase my first year in office because the timing wasn't right, the pandemic hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| I didn't include it last year for similar reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| and also because I knew there were some people running for reelection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| and I knew that that would have been a challenging time for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| I know that there's never a good time, but we're in an acute situation for our housing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| We're in an acute situation for our employment and labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| And that's why I'm proposing it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| And that's why I'm also proposing to include the entire compensation plan all in one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| because this is an acute issue now, but it's been building for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| And we need a bold move to retain all these hardworking people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| to provide those essential services for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| So does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| $10 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Yes, and that's what I wanted to know because, yeah, there's a lot of misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| that it's going up by hundreds of dollars each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| My concern, which I shared with you, was the timing of this and the housing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| I know that people are going to use this as an excuse to raise rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| And that saddens me because we're talking about $10 a month, $20 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3890)|
| 1:04:58| I also had put forth a substitute motion two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| saying that I wanted to cover the compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| but not the piece that was going towards the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| I spent a lot of time talking to Rob Frost today in how to put that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| What it means is us discussing what we're going to cut in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| all of us agreeing that those are the places we want to make the cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| and all of that coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| And I don't think it has ever occurred that a budget has been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I can't recall that, Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| It has been amended in the past, but it's been quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| I don't think it's been since the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| So I really want to put a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| I want to propose that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| but I don't know the heavy lifting of where to cut, what to take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3962)|
| 1:06:13| I'm hoping that the next year we do this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| that Council has a chance to be involved in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| and we can really look at what each department is asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| and then have conversations about where we think what can be pared down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| The other conversation that I've had with so many people is this hate of funding government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| I don't see these are people that we're funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| So that conversation does not seem genuine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| We're talking about I don't want my firemen to have to mow yards on the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| just so that they can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| I want them to be well rested if I have something happen at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| So I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Yes, a question I think probably for Ms. Welch or Mr. Brace, whoever would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| There's been talk, of course, about the 50-cent increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| but my understanding also is there's an equalization process that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| so the new appraisals that have come out will undergo a process by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| and those will be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| My understanding is that the 50-cent increase after that readjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| we expect to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| That's exactly right, which is consistent with previous mayors, Mayor Haslam, Mayor O'Hara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| and, of course, Mayor Ash over 16 years did well over 50 cents of tax raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| I think it's important that the public hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| That's information that we've had access to, and partly because we have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| staff and lots of documents, but I'm not sure that that's gotten out to the public as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| And one other point on that, too, is that the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| we anticipate the certified tax rate being with the tax increase around $2.10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| which is the lowest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| We look back 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| It's the lowest in that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| We didn't go back before 50 years, but it'll be around $2.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| Again, those are estimates based on what we have so far from property assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Sorry, your light's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| I think it's a sign I don't need to talk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| But I do want to say, Councilwoman Singh, I shared your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| I had the same sort of conversations about how we make amendments to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| to make sure that we fully fund the compensation study and are there other places we can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| I will say, regardless of what happens tonight, the city's always going to need more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4143)|
| 1:09:12| The county's always going to need more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| Sometimes we get it with sales tax revenue, property taxes, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I would like to encourage you, Mayor, as someone who served on the Board of Education with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| you know full well that no city in the state of Tennessee gives more than the required, by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4167)|
| 1:09:37| 50 cents on the dollar for sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| The city of Knoxville, when it got out of the school business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| gave the county an additional 22 cents of sales tax revenue for every dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| That equates to $38 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| If we had that, we would not be having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| City residents are county residents too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| They pay county taxes for the school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| The reason that was done primarily was to help offset pension liabilities that occurred 45 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4209)|
| 1:10:17| I ask you, Mayor, to please do everything you can to research, to find us additional sources of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| so that we don't always have to go back to the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| Thank you, Councilmember Fugate. I'm on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| Councilmember McKenzie and then Councilmember Ryder and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| And I agree with the sentiments of all of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| There is never a good time to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| And right now it's more challenging for everyone with inflation, prices of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| But we also know that there is an obligation for us to pay the people who not only protect and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| but maintain the city services that all of us enjoy, all of us as citizens and residents of the city enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4261)|
| 1:11:09| Councilmember Fugate brought up a very interesting point as it relates to the amount of money that we, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4269)|
| 1:11:17| give to the county for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| I'd like to encourage Mayor and her staff as well as Council and my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| for us to maybe look very closely at what would that benefit the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| because we do know that there are some perilous times ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| We don't know if inflation is going to get better or worse in the next three years, three to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| And I think that we have to proactively start looking at additional solutions now before we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4302)|
| 1:11:51| I have struggled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| We've heard, all of us have heard from so many people, people who support this, other people who are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| But I feel that we, with everything that's before us, there is a great need for us to move forward to support these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| I would also like to encourage, as Councilwoman Singh stated, that council be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| be afforded the opportunity to be engaged much earlier and receive information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| the packets and budget materials much sooner than we historically do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| so we can have a more comprehensive conversation around where we feel like things could be tightened up a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4341)|
| 1:12:29| As it relates to capital budget projects, I think that we're going to have to take a closer look at those things moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| especially those that are out there that are going to require additional amounts of funding that are substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| and over and above what they were budgeted to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| So those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Again, I do want to take an opportunity to thank all of the city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| especially our men and women in uniform, police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you for your service and all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| I think the recognition today was very appropriate because there are so many people who believe that fire only takes care of fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| that they're not saving lives and they're not serving the community every day, as well as our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| So thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Ms. Juneau, I'd like to ask you a question to tag on something that my colleagues just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| The value of the tax raise that we're asking for, what's the total addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| In the amount of the 50 cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| It's about 26.115 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| What are the amounts that we give through the local option sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| The 50 cents that were required and then the 22 cents above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| Last year we gave, I believe, an additional $38 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| So it's projected to be additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| So it's above and beyond what the tax increase is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| And just know that that goes directly to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| It never comes to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| It does not come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| It goes directly and then we're cut a check from the trustee electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| And does the school system get the entire, they get the 38 million plus the other 50 cents of the 72 cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| To my knowledge, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Do they get the full amount or are there other fees or part kept by the state and the trustee's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| The state does withhold a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| I think it's 1.25 percent, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| And the county trustee also withholds a commission of 1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| Of both the 50 cent part plus the other 22 cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| So the additional 38 million and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| And that fee was not always, at the trustee level, was not always levied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| It's an optional 1 percent that has not always been levied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| It's essentially for a couple of electronic transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| It's a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| So the county gets a cut and the county gets a cut and then the county gets another cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| And the state gets a cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| And the state gets a cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| But the county never raises taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| And it is also, I didn't know this, the county also has a wheel tax that was passed before I ever moved here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| that was supposed to be a short-term thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Since we have a county commissioner here, I want to talk about our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| I just want to bring up the county budget for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| I'm going to pass it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I had a city and county resident come to one of my campaign events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| and ask me to cut the wheel tax that was promised to be a short-term thing to build the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| And it was supposed to go away when the library was built and paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Well, I moved here after that was passed, so I didn't know anything any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| And I was actually on the library advisory board as a volunteer with the then library director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| And he kept talking about the library that was going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| and I had no idea what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| So, anyway, I found out, A, I can't cut the wheel tax because I'm not on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| I did get the information from my constituent, and I found out from my commissioner direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| all the other things that that county tax revenue is spent on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| and the library is not one of them, and it was not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| But it is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| So I just wanted to bring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| This has been hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| A lot's been said, but, you know, with any budget, it's important that we balance these investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| make sure that they're effective and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Knox will be better next year as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| And so that's the things we've been poring over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| We've been through thousands of pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| but I want to review some of the things that are deep in those pages that maybe not everybody's aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| But first, I know I've asked hours and hours of questions of this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| and I think I've earned the right to dig in a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| But I first want to thank the administration, everybody that's put together every flavor of number possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| It means a lot, and the hours spent into this are necessarily exhausting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| much like parenting, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| We all want to get this right, and we've talked a lot about compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| and I will in just a minute because it will be the reason we either raise taxes or don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| But as I've talked to people in the first district for years, they've asked for investments in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| So there's some pieces of this budget that are, I would say, ordinary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| but since we're digging in deep here as to what investments in neighborhoods are being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| I want to call out a few of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| In the first district, that includes an overhaul of technology for kids at CESA Webb Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| It includes a playground equipment at Gary Underwood Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| continued investments in Augusta Quarry, which used to be a place you couldn't really play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| trail connections at Marie Meyers Park, doubling the amount of litter cleanup in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| building and infrastructure upgrades at Sam Duff Memorial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| funding for Boys and Girls Club at the South Knoxville Community Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| additional investment in urban wilderness, infrastructure investments at Iams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| up to seven miles of roads paved, restoration of our blueways, Goose, First, Second, and Baker Creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4699)|
| 1:18:28| sidewalks on Neyland Drive, construction of Fort Kidd, hopefully sooner rather than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| speed calming in South Haven, and sidewalks that connect Sevier Avenue to Sutry Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| That's in these pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| So we're talking a lot about compensation, but the people that I talk to in the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| on front porches and in backyards, and at the 10 monthly neighborhood meetings in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| I hear about investments in neighborhoods like the ones I just rattled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| So while it's important to pay the people who deserve it, retain talent, we'll talk about that in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| it's also important to invest in the places that people call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| People want to see investments in a quarter mile around their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| and I'm really proud of all those investments across the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| Another thing that's in here that spans the entire city is an increase in funding for litter reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| So we all want a better place to live, and cleaning up trash is not fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| but agencies that help the city and public works spend hours and hours keeping our clean as pretty as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4769)|
| 1:19:38| and that includes a matching grant, I believe, from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| I also applaud the continued investments to reduce youth gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| I want everybody to remember about a year or two ago a lot of conversations we had in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| There's continued investments in here, and while we're talking about compensation a lot tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| we're trying to prevent future young folks dying from gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| So I don't want to forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| I also applaud the investments in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| So when we talk about belt tightening, a lot of the conversation in our community around house prices rising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4810)|
| 1:20:19| some folks don't have houses, and so the investments at Austin Homes and Western Heights hopefully will fill a lot of that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4819)|
| 1:20:29| In terms of compensation, which is probably the largest driver for this potential tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| as I mentioned, there's ten neighborhood associations in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| and I can promise you they meet every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| And the number one thing I hear from them is public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Sometimes that takes the shape of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Sometimes it takes the shape of speed calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| Sometimes it takes the place of firefighters that I hold dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| And there are a lot of nuances in this, but the short of it is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| The most significant barrier to improving community safety is staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4860)|
| 1:21:08| Staffing is almost the most significant barrier to delivering all of the community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| So let's get real practical for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| We want to pay people for their work, but we also can't hire folks that are retiring and leaving for other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| So staffing is the most significant barrier to delivering any service in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| It just is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| And so this has been asked for for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| This is not something that bubbled up three months ago or four months ago to raise wages for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| I remember conversations about a multi-use stadium where we wanted everybody else in the community to pay their employees certain wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| And so we're going to follow our own guidance on that hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| While the city is losing more retirees than people to other jobs, we have to replace everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| Eighty percent of the turnover is in the bottom half of pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| Eighty percent of the people turning over are in the bottom half of pay grades, pay grades one through six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| which is why I support this $15 an hour starting wage, and that should help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| Police turnover isn't as high as general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| That's unsustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| So say what you will about anything related to compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| We can't hire fast enough to keep up for the people retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| It's literally starving the city's resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| Fire turnover is not as significant, but their wages are way behind other metros, and compression has produced inequities for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| So I think this is really important that everybody have that full context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| These are all the questions we dug through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I have a few kind of remaining questions, maybe for Director Janot or the mayor, whoever wants to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4969)|
| 1:22:59| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| It's important that this is sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| So there's been a lot of talk about how long will this last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| Why can't we use other funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| A lot of my colleagues, I think all of my colleagues would agree that if we looked at this line by line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| we would all agree on different things to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| That's not within this body's control to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| And a lot of the folks that aren't in favor of this, I totally understand the momentary inflation burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| It's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| It's groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| It's gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| All of those are real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| And so I want to make sure we've all, at least I've tried to make sure that there is not a corner of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| that I think is substantial enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| We can all file $100,000 here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| But you can't find, I think, $17 million is what I heard earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| There's been a lot of federal dollars flowing through the municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| Can you explain, either mayor or Director Janot, why those funds can't be used instead of raising property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| Ms. Janot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Councilman Smith, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| The budget does include several million of both federal and state dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| The challenge would be that those are one-time revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| Aside from that, they do often have significant limitations on their use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| but the key being that they cannot be used for recurring expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| So we could pay for this for a year, but then we're back here at the same table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| So that's the most significant source of new revenue coming into the city this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| and it's all federal dollars and it's one-time funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| I also want to point out that the city's financials are sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Now, that may sound a bit conflicting to proposing a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| but we've paid down $100 million in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| This proposed tax increase is not a desperation move to fix broken finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5092)|
| 1:24:59| Our finances are in good shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| and so what I want to ask is why can't we use our equity to pay for these investments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| Is that a similar conflict in terms of sustaining those funds over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Any savings or equity would be one-time funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| There's also been a question that's asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| why don't we exclude compensation for people making over a certain amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| And, Mayor, I'd like to pose that question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| $100,000, $80,000, $120,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| why don't we exclude these folks from this compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Well, the labor market is the labor market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| whether you're at the low end of the scale or middle or high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| And the fact is, and Ms. Juneau can attest to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| our finance department, our engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| our information services department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| those are all people who are middle to higher end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| and they are having high turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| and challenges with people retiring and retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| and attracting people to fill positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| So the labor market is a challenge at all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| And also, as you know, because you all have seen the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| the vast majority of the people who work for the city of Knoxville are not hirers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| They're mostly low- to moderate-income folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| and this budget is a real shot in the arm for equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| if you care about paying people fair market wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| most of whom are in the mid-range of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| But the labor market, if you lose an engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| or a highly trained information services person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| it would be really hard to replace them at the current salary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| So my last question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| does this give you the funding you need to resolve the staffing crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Okay, I think it's really important that this is a big investment in people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| but I pragmatically don't want to do that if it's not going to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| So we have an immediate staffing crisis that this solves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| but it also pays people for the protection we get as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| Council Member Smith, sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I just wanted to remind you that the high earners, myself and my cabinet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| are not included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I think these are good investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| It's not with light consideration that I would support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| but we can either hold steady and wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| or make investments that we're financially ahead to prevent falling behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| And so I'm pragmatically supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| I just want to add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| A year ago I met with Uniform Bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| and it was a really heavy discussion around the crisis we face in the community at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| And a lot of it has to do – there was also a question about why there's a lot –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| why are there not police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| Why are there not enough police here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Why don't they solve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Why don't firefighters come faster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| What does it take to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| And so one of those people looked me dead in the eye and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| And that stuck with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| And I didn't know at the time what that looked like or how to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| I'm not the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| And some of these things are not all solvable by an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| But I think in respect to solving a pragmatic need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| and serving those Uniform Bodies in the way that was asked, this is what I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| So I plan on supporting this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| I would just say there's a lot in this budget that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| There's a part of this I wish we'd put on pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| I absolutely support everything that we're doing for staff and compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| I like all the projects that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| but I'm not sure they all have to be done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| That's just one woman's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And as we said, if we went line item by line item, we would not all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| That's why the mayor is elected to be the chief executive of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| She's put her budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| These are her priorities, and we as council get to say they're our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| I struggle with the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| I support the budget, and I support what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| I worry about a tax increase for all the reasons that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| Fiduciarily, I worry about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| which is why I'm glad the mayor is going to look to seek for alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| and additional sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| We have room and local options sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| We have other money that we might be able to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| and not have to do a property tax again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| It is encouraging to hear after the fact that it will be a 35-cent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| What I'm hearing from people is they don't believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| People don't believe that because they haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| But what I will say is I, like Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| had thought about bringing amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| But as Councilman Smith said, amendments won't make up $17 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| which will not reduce the tax rate substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| I hear things about I could live with 40 cents, I could live with 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| But every citizen I have talked to supports funding for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| What I hear are questions about the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| But I do want all our employees to know the citizens of this city appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| and want us to approve the compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor of Item 9B, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| 9C is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal, and mixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| to provide sufficient revenues to fund the general fund and debt service fund operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| and debt service obligations of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| and ending June 30, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| Motion made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Council members, there are six people signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| We'll start with Mr. Robert Corum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5510)|
| 1:32:00| You can start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Robert Corum, 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| I want to thank everybody that's taken time to talk to us throughout the past few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| everyone that's taken time to answer emails, everyone that's taken time to listen to this important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| This tax increase doesn't come lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| I can respect that, and I can respect the difficult decision that you all are having to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| Just to kind of put some things into perspective, though, 80% of this proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| 80% of this tax increase goes to funding our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| You know, this is Public Works Week, and last week we celebrated anniversaries of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| some that had 20 years plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| One of my employees got recognized in that as a 20-year veteran of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| and after 20 years of working in the City of Knoxville, his current hourly salary is $16.48 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| Let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| We're asking to raise entry level right now to a level that McDonald's can serve at $15 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| and he makes $16.48 after 20 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| I understand that people don't want to pay more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| I wouldn't want to pay more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| I like to keep what I've earned, but I also recognize that we have a responsibility to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| We have a responsibility to our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Questions have been asked about belt tightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| In public service where I work, we have went from two people working on a knuckle boom to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| We've reduced the amount of people that are out collecting the yard waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| We also went from a day of service to a week of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| That way, at the end of the week, our employees or our brush crews can get ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| and come and help trim and cut grass and weeds so that people can see as they pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| In my department, I oversee a crew that picks up litter downtown and cleans the safe space mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5635)|
| 1:34:03| I oversee downtown garbage collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| I oversee parks garbage and recycling collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| I have street sweepers, a knuckle boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| I have a crew that takes care of market squares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| I have a crew that mows the city-owned lots and our vacant coast lots that are in disarray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5655)|
| 1:34:24| I've got a crew that mows right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| I've got a crew that covers special events, and I've got a crew that cleans up graffiti downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| and I've got a crew that cleans up behind homeless camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I'm also five people short on my crew, and I've been as many as eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| So if anybody would like to tell me which one of those services to prioritize over the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| I would be more than glad to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| The truth is all of those services are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| All the services that my colleagues provide are important and crucial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| but we're not going to be able to keep them up without this increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| and we have to have the increase to raise the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| In January of 2021, we had 46 people apply to come work for public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5705)|
| 1:35:13| and out of those, 21 showed up for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| Since June of last year, we've never had more than eight that have shown up for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5717)|
| 1:35:25| Again, we're hoping to raise wages to $15 an hour starting pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| We're hoping that we can get folks in here at the wages of Chick-fil-A and McDonald's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| so that we can train them to get a CDL and to be able to pick up the brush in your neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| We're willing to put in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| We've put in the work for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| We had Mercer that was a study that was done that was going to give us a substantial wage increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| and then the third year wasn't fully funded, so we missed out on that full allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| But we would have been three years behind whenever that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| I applaud American Canada for taking the initiative to fund it all at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| to fulfill the promises that were made when we had her come to our city employees association and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5769)|
| 1:36:16| Whenever she said that, no, $12.25 an hour is not a livable wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| We want you all to be able to raise families here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| So just in some perspective, I looked up the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5786)|
| 1:36:34| For a family of three, poverty is considered $23,030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| And for a family of four, it's $27,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| Right now, our entry level, base one, makes $25,480,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| and with the new 13-16 that we currently pay, they make $27,372.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| We're paying our employees below poverty for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you, Mr. Coram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Thank you, Mr. Coram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Next up is Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| Mr. Marlow, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| I'm R. Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| In fact, I emailed and talked to most of you privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| I think we need to go more just because we need more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| I sat through the nine hours on Friday, and I heard lots and lots and lots of budget cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| bolt tightening, understaffed, making do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| I mean, communications has an 11-year-old camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| My friends make fun of me because I have a five-year-old iPhone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| That's just ridiculous for a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| Engineering has got three times the permits coming in, and they don't have any more staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| Peter up in public works, they've got numerous new permits and not enough staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| And this impacts me as I file for these permits because I'm trying to build things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| Listening to Chad and the guys over in public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| they have some of the dirtiest, nasty jobs that we have in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| and they're getting paid almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| I don't know why anybody would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| I don't know why somebody would stay for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I hire higher than what a person has been here for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| I start hiring higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| It takes money to run a city, and I understand tax increases aren't real comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| I mean, they're politically a landmine, and they're not comfortable on the side of the citizens either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| I own 40-some-odd properties, so a tax increase will affect me in a far greater way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| than it affects most other city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| But I believe it's worth investing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| We're hearing that this will be $20 a month on a $200,000 home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| which I think is, I don't know, I don't know the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| but I'd say that's probably about an average home in Knoxville, $20 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| If you're a homeowner, $20 a month seems to be the best deal going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| to have adequate police, adequate fire, trash pickup, recycling pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5959)|
| 1:39:27| I don't know why this, that everybody's having so much difficulty with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| If my math is correct, and it's a complicated formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| you take the tax appraised times 25%, divide by 100, then multiply it by the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| and I think that puts a $200,000 home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| After what I've heard, I think it's, after this raise, it'll effectively be $210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| I think that's something like $80 a month for your total tax bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| For a $200,000 home, it would be about $80 if my math is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| Ladies and gentlemen, that's less than a cell phone bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| And I don't know about any of y'all, but I would gladly give up my smartphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| to know that when I call 911, the police will respond in adequate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| with adequate training, adequate equipment, that fire department will come quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| and be ready to put out a fire and risk their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| It's worth that just to have the trash disappear every Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| and recycling picked up every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| So if anybody's worried about your constituents being upset if we don't pass this tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| imagine what's going to happen when their trash is piling up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| and there's raccoons scattering shit all over the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| And we can't pick up their garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| We can't get somebody to come whenever we need 911 to put out a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| That's when citizens will be really, really upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| So please, at a very minimum, pass this $0.50 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| Next up is Larry McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Mr. McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6063)|
| 1:41:15| Hello again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| That's a tough act to follow, but I don't want crap on my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6076)|
| 1:41:24| I'm not speaking to you at this point as President McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| I'm speaking to you as Taxpayer McAfee who lives in Councilwoman Ryder's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| I've been a member of the Knoxville community since 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| when I entered the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| After graduating, instead of moving back home to Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| I decided to stay here in Knoxville because it's a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| My wife and I decided to have kids here and raise our kids here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| because we feel like it's a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| I enjoy the sidewalks we have in Councilwoman Ryder's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| I enjoy the beautiful roads we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| I enjoy my trash being picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| And I enjoy other amenities that this great city offers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| I'm more than willing to pay my fair share to continue to receive those amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| Talking to many of you, it's been a debate of 40 cents versus 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| We're talking 10 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| For the great things that this city offers, 10 cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| I'm more than willing to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| My wife is more than willing to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| I'm pretty sure Stair to Pearl is willing to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| Now I'm talking to you as President McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| You ask the young lady who was saved from rushing floodwaters in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6171)|

| 1:43:15| when the fire and technical rescue team had to come out and rescue him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6195)|

| 1:43:35| If they're willing to pay it, I say they're willing to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| So come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| If you're hearing a little riff-raff from some of your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| because they're not willing to pay it or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| I'm willing to bet they're not willing to pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| because they haven't used any of our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| They haven't dialed 911 because they're having a medical emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| or they need police for security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| or they're having trouble getting their trash picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| So I'm telling you, support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| The next speaker is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6253)|
| 1:44:27| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| I'm speaking in support of the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| And it's really, it goes back to what I said about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| It's just aligning our priorities and funding our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| And we're at a point to where we have to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| and we have to prioritize public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| I was the FOP president for probably eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| and on the board for a few years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| So for about ten years, I got involved in these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| learned about these things and worked on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| And I got pretty frustrated by the end of those ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| and I kind of tried to step away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| We'd had similar conversations all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| and times honestly then were pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| We had money, we had options, we had different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| I know this is hard and this is a very rough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| But the very core things that our citizens depend on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| and I'm one of those citizens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| I live in Councilman Ryder's district as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| and happy to be a Knoxvilleian, love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| So I can kind of invest in both ways there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| But a saying comes back to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| In 1962 in his State of the Union address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| President John Fitzgerald Kennedy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| the best time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| And we came forward and we asked and we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| hey, this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| We see this from our end, but the folks that made decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| at the time really didn't see it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| and maybe they felt that things would be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| as they always were and we'd be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| a thousand applicants for 50 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Those days are long gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| They've been gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| We passed the best time to fix the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| but we still have a responsibility to fix the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| It's still raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| Next speaker, Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Steve King representing City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| Many of you have heard me say before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| that I've celebrated my 42nd year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| with the City Engineering Department earlier this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| and I've never been a mayor's political advisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| but if this mayor had come to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| I want to raise the tax 50% this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| I would have said don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| But this mayor is recommending this to you all tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| because she has a compensation package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| that she feels strongly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| and she sees the need in our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| You know, you've heard over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| service can't fill all their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| They're in competition with McDonald's for entry level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| I work in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| We have positions that others have tried to hire our people away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| We have trouble keeping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Really, we're to the point on our entry level engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| that we pay less than surrounding communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| So this tax increase, although nobody likes it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| I get upset when I go to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| when I pull up at the gas pump, nobody likes to pay more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| but sometimes we have to to continue the services that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| So I encourage you all to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Next up is Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| You can start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| First off, I learned a lot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| That $30-something million to the school system, wow, that's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| If we had some of that back, that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| But thank you all for funding the school system for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| Start off by saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| First off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| Second off, I want a cool name like Sterl the Pearl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| Maybe Kevin the Fat Man Faddis or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| That's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| No, but in all seriousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| you guys are actually more fiscally sound than you think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| The salaries that have been proposed aren't at 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| so the city is actually getting a pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| You know, when we answer calls for Mr. Pearl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| you wouldn't want 80% of my ability to go towards your life, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| I wouldn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| Mr. Jay that was here utilized our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| He wouldn't want that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| We do our daily best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Everybody does in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| We're not asking for more than we deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| I feel it's fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| Councilman Thomas, we spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| and I appreciate your questions about some of your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| and some of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| Oakwood-Lincoln Park, I emailed you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| If you don't mind, I'm going to touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Some of Councilmember Thomas' constituents are older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| and they utilize our services a lot more than some areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| I understand they're worried about tax increases on a fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| I would ask the city to look into some kind of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| to where they can educate some of the elderly citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| on possibly getting tax breaks through some of their utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| I'm pretty sure there's some around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Councilwoman Fugate, we've spoke a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| I sent you an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| I want the public to also be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| Years ago, and I've been doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| I've been trying to fight for fair and equitable wages for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| I was 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| I was thin, had hair, didn't have a hot wife like I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| You're welcome, honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| Two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| I'll just not say nothing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| We've been fighting for this really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| and it's something that I think and what I was going to bring up in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| was we don't generate money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| The new businesses, the homeowners here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| but what we do do is we're a Class II fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| We save them insurance money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| That's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| When we go to a Class III,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| they will feel that in their insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| I looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| So a tax increase is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| So with that, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| I hope we can all vote on this and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| Council, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| People signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Councilmember Ryder and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6709)|
| 1:51:56| You know, this isn't easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| and we've taken lots of phone calls from lots of folks that feel this is going to hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| and I think there's a lot of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| and I do ask that communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| that we work on getting the messaging out about the certified tax rate and how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6729)|
| 1:52:17| If anyone gets questions about it or anybody at home wants to know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| the state comptroller's office has an amazing video on their website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| that explains the certified tax rate and how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| because most folks that I'm having conversations with do not understand how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| This is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| I'm going to pay a lot more tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| but I also recognize, partly because I've got a large assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| and I will say one of the things that's channeling into this is the assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| There were a lot of us who were woefully underassessed for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| My assessment from the county tax assessor was not matching what private appraisals were giving me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| and so now all of a sudden it's made a jump, and that's part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| I feel like we're talking about uniform services a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| and no offense to you guys, because I'll come back to that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| There's a lot of other city employees who do things that make sure their vehicles run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| make sure their vehicles get ordered, the orders get filled, the checks get cut, things get cleaned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| There's a lot of work that goes on that doesn't necessarily get branded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| in a way that people can talk about it so positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| So I want to echo the comments that were made by my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| that no one has specifically not wanted to fund employees and the services they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| and our community really does love it when you guys show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| and they let us know when something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| And on that note, our community is always letting us know when there isn't a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| when there isn't a greenway, when there isn't something being picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| when something needs to be done, when there's flood water to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Those are things that we constantly have to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| and the sad thing is most of the time we're only giving little bits of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| We're asked to do a lot for homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| and we only have a little bit of money to do the things that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| because we have the major services that we supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| And anyway, I am going to support this, and I think we're doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6865)|
| 1:54:33| and I think, you know, this is going on my fifth budget, I think, if I count correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| and we've gone through this line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| I've gone through this every year, day-long workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| in addition to 12 months a year working and going through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| and I support what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| There weren't any Easter eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| There's no crazy, strange things in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| It's just that things cost more for all of us and including the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| and we have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| We can't not do the things that we do and that we're expected to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| because it's a liability in many cases not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| The tax increase is a difficult one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| Through our conversations, I have gained a better understanding of why the 50 cent was selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6928)|
| 1:55:37| for the increase, but the reason I struggle with it is because I do think that there are areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| where we could better use funds, and this is something that I've been pushing since I was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6943)|
| 1:55:50| and year after year, I feel like we just keep throwing money at problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| and I sincerely do not feel like that is going to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| I want you all to get a salary increase because I feel like city employees deserve a living wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| and deserve to be paid well, but I continue to be concerned that this will not fix our recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| and retention issue, and I continue to be concerned that we're going to need additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6976)|
| 1:56:23| in our budget to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| You know, one issue, one question that was raised from our previous discussions was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| how much money is spent on the vacant positions each year in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| and we got a response back that last year there was about $6.4 million spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| or budgeted for the vacant positions and about $4 million spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| and so that's $2 million right there that's in our budget that could be used for something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| and that is a part of this tax increase that we are funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7023)|
| 1:57:09| I would rather see us, you know, well, one way to think of it is if we are just looking particularly at KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7029)|
| 1:57:20| let's stop adding new responsibilities to KPD and instead, you know, task others with those responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7040)|
| 1:57:32| so that police officers can actually get back to policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| I think that's why we're having a hard time recruiting because police officers are being asked to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| that they are not qualified to do, and then they're getting yelled at for doing it the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| So why don't we actually get the folks in place who are qualified to do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7068)|
| 1:57:56| and stop using these as PR opportunities to try to recruit people back into policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7076)|
| 1:58:03| That's actually not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| We have to address the issues that we have going on within policing itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| and that takes money within the budget to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| But it at least takes some staff time dedicated to thinking through these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| I would like to see, you know, if we had four positions from KPD that we could put on responding to the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7102)|
| 1:58:35| of people experiencing homelessness, and then those KPD officers who are currently doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| get to go off and do actual policing work rather than just driving around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| and seeing if homeless people are dangerous or not before a social worker can talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| I would not feel very fulfilled by that job either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| I mean, we really have to think smart about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| Throwing money at a problem is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| Actually sitting down and thinking through what's going to solve this problem is the tough work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| and that's the tough work that we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| We can't be afraid to have these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| We can't be afraid that we're going to offend folks or we're going to make folks feel that they're not valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| because what I'm saying is you are valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| We need a safe city, but we also need policing that works for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| and the way that we're approaching policing right now is not good for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| and we've got to do it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| And throwing money at the problem is not going to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| I'm still thinking to this very second whether I support the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| I didn't support the budget, but I do support the salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| I just do not believe that it will prevent us from being back here next year and the year after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7195)|
| 2:00:02| to address the issues we have with recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| You know, this item, just like my colleagues have mentioned in the previous ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| I've been over time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| I've looked at it from every direction you could possibly think to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| and specifically looking at how we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| lessen the impact for taxpayers in this difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| After all that scrutiny and review, I'm going to support this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| We've talked about this many times here tonight and in our budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| Staffing across all departments has been affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| and the impact of inaction here is going to be incredibly profound for our city and its residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7246)|
| 2:00:54| I certainly don't take this decision lightly at all, and I was very reluctant to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| but this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| You know, when we're considering the inflation that people are dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| the expenses that folks are dealing with, I understand and empathize with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| We all experience that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| But this is a crisis we can't afford not to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| We've talked about services tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| We've talked about if you have some issues with what's being proposed in this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7282)|
| 2:01:36| imagine what the issues will be when you call for fire and no one shows up or they take a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7296)|
| 2:01:44| or you call for police and the same thing happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| or you need your services rendered, like you need your trash picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| you need your litter picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| you need countless things that we've talked about over and over again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| That's what this funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Those critical services that everyone depends on, and that's why I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| I agree with much of what Councilwoman Parker was bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| It seems like when we have these discussions, we make decisions like, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| in the future we're going to work on this, we're going to look at this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| we're going to examine this closer, and then we never get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| So that was one of the reasons that I've been having so many conversations with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| that there are, I think compensating the employees is number one and I want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| but there are other problems within the budget that we haven't had good conversations on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| The use of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| I think this is a place where the use of money is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| Seeing no further questions, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| 9D is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to amend Chapter 2, Article 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| and Chapter 8, Article 2 of the Knoxville City Code to adjust the classification and compensation plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| and implement the recommendations of the 2021-2022 Classification and Compensation Study Final Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| In Section 2-450C in the packet, on the packet it's page 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| there's a reference to authorizing the mayor to make changes related to compensation equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7425)|
| 2:03:56| and I think there's some language in there around adjustments to compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| And I guess my question is for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| That doesn't authorize the administration to reduce compensation without just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| It does authorize equity adjustments, but it very specifically says this can't be a promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7454)|
| 2:04:20| it can't be a demotion, it can't be something that needs to go through civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| These are equity adjustments based on the appropriate equity factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| And those equity adjustments can result in a reduction in compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| I expect we might get a lawsuit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| The charter requires just cause or something like that, so that's still in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| On first reading, I had expressed my discomfort with some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| Now, this is the piece where we're authorizing the spending of money for a $2,000 retention bonus for all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| and an extra 3.5% over the already compensated 2.5% cost of living adjustment for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7502)|
| 2:05:13| I still believe that this increase needs to go to those workers who the compensation study most identified as undercompensated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7513)|
| 2:05:21| those at the beginning of the pay scale rather than at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| So I'm going to make a motion that we amend Section 18 to limit the $2,000 one-time bonus to those employees making less than $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7525)|
| 2:05:35| We amend Section 19 to limit the additional 3.5% to employees making less than $100,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7535)|
| 2:05:43| keeping in mind those employees would still get the 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| When I brought this up in our previous meeting, it was discussed that this was going to address $147,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7548)|
| 2:05:57| Well, over eight years, with the 2.5% increase, that combines to over $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7557)|
| 2:06:05| And so I think that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| We've asked a lot of the taxpayers tonight, and I think this is an area where we need to make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| Motion on the floor, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Okay, motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| Vice Mayor, that was a lot of words, and I'm really confused about what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| So this item spends money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| So we have a 6% cost-of-living adjustment for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| There is a 2.5% increase that happens every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| This is adding an additional 3.5% on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| All I'm talking about is the 3.5% piece would be limited to those who are making less than $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| The same thing with the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| This is spending money that we already moved into accounts to spend for a $2,000 bonus for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7615)|
| 2:07:02| What I'm suggesting in this motion is that we limit that to employees who are making less than $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7622)|
| 2:07:12| Well, Vice Mayor, I just wanted to explain my understanding of the 2.5% and 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| The 2.5% is an ordinance that's been around a long time, and that hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| Council has not chosen to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| The 3.5% is a reflection that everybody was below market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| and it's a one-time adjustment to try to help get people up closer to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| And those market—we did a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| It wasn't just a scattershot approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| We did a study that showed that everybody was below, on average, 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| So the fact that the 3.5% plus 2.5% is just 6% shows that that's just part of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7666)|
| 2:07:54| And then the equity adjustments are getting people to whatever the market shows that makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| according to those peer studies that was like 25 or 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| So that's my understanding for why it makes sense and is equitable, whether it's for people at any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7684)|
| 2:08:13| So Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| I just want a point of clarification for Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| Your amendment addresses both the 3.5% and the $2,000 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| I mean, we could separate that if that's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| And I'm not talking about the 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| That would go to all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| It's not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| We're only talking about the 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| And remember in the budget hearings, we had discussions about how the compensation study broke down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| So we had—there's the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| Then there was the 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| Then the 3.5% increase, which combines the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| And that, as we heard from Dr. Drummond, was to address making sure that people who are experienced and working right now start in the new classifications above the minimum, right, and not below the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7733)|
| 2:09:08| We're not—everyone's going to be in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| The 6% is not the entirety of the increases in wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| Everybody moves into the new classifications under the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| So by doing this, all we're doing is saying that this needs to be focused on the base-level workers, which the study itself identified as where the most problems were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7761)|
| 2:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| My concern with this is, you know, we have heard very emphatically from the law department, from the finance department, from the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7780)|
| 2:09:49| those skills and expertise, that those departments are also severely compromised with their lack of, again, professional skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7789)|
| 2:10:06| And we are losing those high-level jobs to the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| So for that reason, you know, secondly, certainly don't begrudge, you know, again, that expertise and that professionalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7810)|
| 2:10:21| that it is a lot of institutional knowledge that, you know, we benefit from and that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7821)|
| 2:10:31| So, you know, to equate from a success standpoint, you know, for those reasons alone, I struggle with supporting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7831)|
| 2:10:42| because we do need that expertise and that professionalism to, you know, run the functions of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7842)|
| 2:10:53| Thank you. Council Member Testerman, Council Member Ryder, then Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| I just want to say I'm not going to support the motion. I appreciate the effort. I think the impact to the budget is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7857)|
| 2:11:05| It's going to save a fraction, in the near term, a fraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7865)|
| 2:11:13| I think we've talked about tonight ways to look at the budget and look at revenues in the future that will meet some of the ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7873)|
| 2:11:24| because I think one of the things you addressed was the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| I want to specifically point out that people who make that income level are not immune to leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7888)|
| 2:11:39| We had an employee that left at six months that was over that level because they got a private market offer of 20 percent higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7899)|
| 2:11:52| And it delayed one of the reports that were required to file to the state through the audit committee that I chair by several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7912)|
| 2:12:03| because other people in the department had to pick up and do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| And it's part of the short staffing in that particular department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| So there are people that work in the city and have put a lot of time into it and put some hard work into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7930)|
| 2:12:19| And we don't need to lose them to the private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7939)|
| 2:12:27| I feel like we'd be cutting off our nose to spite our face, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| And I've dealt with this firsthand with the finance department this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| The reason I jumped on seconded so quickly is Knoxville is one of the top five in income inequality in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7961)|
| 2:12:51| And this is one of those conversations that I think not always throwing money at the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| And as Councilwoman McKenzie had talked about on Friday, I think, that there's also the environment, the work environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7977)|
| 2:13:06| There are other reasons that people stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| With this, I'm not saying that I don't value the people that have a higher income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| It's just addressing income inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| Thank you. Dr. Drummond, since you are really familiar with the details of this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| could you explain what the impact of this amendment might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8003)|
| 2:13:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| When you look at the 3.5%, when the study was completed, the study included a total of 6% to bring people up to the new minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8012)|
| 2:13:43| But it was included in the fact to deal with the idea of inflation, and that's why it's a one-time deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8023)|
| 2:13:50| So once you bring people up to the minimum, then you're able to keep them going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| I know that you discussed the fact of higher income individuals and not doing it for those individuals over 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| While I respect that and understand your thoughts behind that, I want to reiterate not only the mayor's talked about inflation touching all individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8043)|
| 2:14:12| I want to make sure you understand is that those income-level individuals that we're talking about in IS, in engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8052)|
| 2:14:20| and a lot of those industries are critical to sustaining the city's structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8060)|
| 2:14:27| So if you really think about what you're doing, I think you're going to have a group of individuals who have a long-term knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8067)|
| 2:14:37| who have real history, will see this in a very negative fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| So I caution you to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| I know the thought behind this is to deal with income equity, but I will tell you that it's going to cause an inequity on the other side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8086)|
| 2:14:56| So I want you to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| The study was done to look at all positions, and we looked and we studied all positions in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8098)|
| 2:15:06| not just one income level, but we looked at all industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| And so when this was done, it has been determined that you need to get those individuals to a level that they are not wanting to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8110)|
| 2:15:21| It's not that they have not been here for a while, but you're now in a situation that these individuals have an opportunity to retire and go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8121)|
| 2:15:31| That is not what you really want happening with a lot of these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| Dr. Drummond, would this pose an issue with compression?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| Yes, ma'am, it will propose an issue with compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| And when you think about compression, we look at it, and it's not going to be compression at the lowest levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| I need to make sure we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| But when you do this, you're compressing individuals, and they're not going to get the pay increases that separate them to build out the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8155)|
| 2:16:04| and to build out the pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| What you've done now is that you have compressed those highest levels, and they're going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| and you have a bigger spread at the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| So you're going to have issues in the long term as people promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| If you do not fix this, you have to create a system that has a spread that allows for the level of promotion and progression through time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8178)|
| 2:16:28| Thank you, Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| Council Member Ryder, still talking about Vice Member Berto's amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| Yeah, I just wanted to counter one of the comments made that we may have higher income equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8193)|
| 2:16:41| the disparity, or inequity, sorry, in this region or this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| I think that is a reflection of many other factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| and I think simply causing compression within the pay structure here is not the solution to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| I think the issue in our general region is education and jobs that have been available historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| This is not going to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| Okay, the vote is on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Vice Member Berto's motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| This has been an issue that I've studied long and hard at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| It's a thing that concerned me from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| At first blush, I leaned heavily in the direction of my colleague, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| It did bother me the fact that people who were already making relatively good incomes might get a boost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8249)|
| 2:17:38| that the people at the lower income level did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8258)|
| 2:17:44| I've looked at the numbers that have been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| Ms. Juneau's staff have had conversations with HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8268)|
| 2:17:55| If we did implement the suggestion that is well-intentioned and has a lot of basis by Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8275)|
| 2:18:04| just looking at the numbers, I don't think it's going to be a significant savings for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8284)|
| 2:18:12| If it were, that was mainly what I was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| But it's not going to prevent the need for a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| If it were otherwise, I would almost certainly support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| But looking at it overall and relatively speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| I am hesitant, I guess, to kind of disrupt the MAG report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| which I think was done as a whole and looking at as one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8318)|
| 2:18:47| There are issues that I'm not clear about, about retention of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| Some very good points have been made about what attracts people to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8332)|
| 2:19:02| I don't want it to be strictly something that's competitive with the private industry as far as pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8342)|
| 2:19:12| I would like to think and do know that people stay in public service for other reasons than just money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8352)|
| 2:19:22| However, there are practical reasons as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| This was something that I had to struggle with a good bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| But after looking at the numbers and looking at the practical aspects of how much money we would actually save,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8371)|
| 2:19:40| and then weighing with the fact that we may have people with technical skills that may leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8380)|
| 2:19:48| I think I'm going to defer to the MAG study and not advocate any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8388)|
| 2:19:58| One example, I suppose, is like I'll choose the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| There's one employee with the fire department that makes over $100,000, one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8404)|
| 2:20:12| That person will not get the raise because of decisions that the mayor and staff has made to exempt people at those levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8412)|
| 2:20:24| The mayor hasn't highlighted that so much, but as a council person it has been mentioned, and I'll underline that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| that some of the mayor's staff that would probably be affected by that are exempted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8430)|
| 2:20:41| With the figures that I've received in this general stamp, the vast majority of the pay raises are going to go to people less than $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8441)|
| 2:20:54| in fact, even less than $70,000 or $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| So even though I do have some reservations about using taxpayer money to give pay increases to people at relatively higher salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8460)|
| 2:21:16| I'm just reluctant to, I guess, alter the MAG study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8476)|
| 2:21:24| which I think was done to try to address this system as a whole, address compression, address incentive for people to stay at their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8484)|
| 2:21:36| so that possibly if they stay long enough they will get those higher levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| Even though I really have a lot of camaraderie with Vice Mayor Roberto's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8502)|
| 2:21:53| I think I'm going to come down on the other side on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| She's my wingwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| I was just going to say about the compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| Really, I'm not sure if there's something going on that I don't get a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| But I was just going to say one thing about compensation as it relates to this and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8536)|
| 2:22:21| I think I mentioned it Friday at our budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| I think our citizens and everyone needs to understand that the previous city council a while back took some pretty big steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8544)|
| 2:22:34| and changed the pension plan, which now takes ten years to be vested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8554)|
| 2:22:41| That was a prudent fiduciary thing to do to help with our unfunded liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| However, the lure of a pension is not, our new employees don't feel that as strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8567)|
| 2:22:58| The velvet handcuffs or golden handcuffs aren't there like they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| So as much, Lord, my mic really did cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8583)|
| 2:23:11| Oh, it's my fault. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| I was just going to say I do think the 3.5% to actually move people more in line with commensurate pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8596)|
| 2:23:27| is more important to me than the $2,000 retention bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| That is a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| It's nice to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| But I think the 3.5%, while it is generous, many employers are looking at having to do more based on market wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8616)|
| 2:23:45| And I certainly don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| And we're doing it for everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| I don't want to exempt a few highly trained, highly skilled employees that we can't afford to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8629)|
| 2:24:02| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| I wanted to call for the question, but I see that another colleague has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| I somewhat feel this conversation is getting a little redundant when we're talking about compensation salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8649)|
| 2:24:17| We have talked immensely on Friday as well as today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| I know that some of us seem to have heartburn when it comes to people making a certain amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| but we don't know what people's circumstances are in their households and what expenses that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| and the challenges that they're faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| And so with that said, I'm going to go ahead and defer to Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| and hopefully we can vote on it after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| I agree with the sentiments of Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| I don't think that the $2,000 bonus is going to help with the staffing crisis for those who are making over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8687)|
| 2:24:55| So I agree with a lot of the comments that are made here, but that specific bonus piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| I'm not going to earn many fans in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| but I don't think that bonus for the next two months is going to be significant enough to increase retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8701)|
| 2:25:08| I do think that 3.5% will be significant long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| So unless we separate those two, I'm not going to be able to support the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| but I appreciate the sentiment and agree with the logic behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| All those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8723)|

| 2:26:01| So yes, Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| I just wanted to make sure on that vote I was recorded as a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| It kind of didn't come out of my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| So there's Ms. Parker as a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| I appreciate all the good discussion on the previous amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220517?start=8780)|
