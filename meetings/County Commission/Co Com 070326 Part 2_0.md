| 0:00:00| We've been granting an awful lot of tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| We've been granting an awful lot of tears here in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3)|
| 0:00:05| of Knoxville which I want to help the city because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:08| represent city people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=8)|
| 0:00:10| But it bothers me to think that we're giving these tax breaks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:16| help them and then they're coming out and annexing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:18| businesses and things and taking our sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| And I think we just need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=21)|
| 0:00:23| I think we need to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| I'd like to defer it for thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| Got a motion to defer, seconded by Commissioner Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| Mr. Mayor, you want to respond to it or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| We've got a motion to defer and it's properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| Okay, we're back on ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| 102 on page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| This is consideration of an ordinance to make unlawful the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| use of the Knox County solid waste and recycling centers by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| persons and vehicles whose license tags are not registered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Okay, Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 to defer until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| Make that a form of a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| Seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Just a comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| When they bring this back, I'd be interested in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| explanation of how they're going to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| I think that's the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I can answer that for Commissioner Cate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| It is our intent at this time to hire off-duty Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| Sheriff Department deputies to help us enforce it there at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| I do not think that our Knox County solid waste employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| can adequately enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| I think it's putting them in a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| You're going to use driver's license or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| How many people in Knox County buy cars at the airport motor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:09| Every one that does is violating the law if they don't buy their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| tag here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| I mean, the dealers over there, you wouldn't even tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| That's if you want to talk about budgets by not paying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| will tax, you're violating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| It's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Mr. Mayor, when the will tax was passed, did we not, the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| purchase was exempt from that if they bought it in Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| I'm just using Blount County as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I thought that's the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I asked, you know, if they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| I think it's the first year, if you buy it, because dealers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| register it out of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| No, I really think we need something different than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| license plates along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| You know, say you've got a child that lives in Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| County and you use his truck to haul something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| I think we need to, if they come in, we need to check their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| identification, their driver's license to be sure of where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| do live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| We'll come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Maybe you won't even check the titles of the car and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| But we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| We'll work on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Don't misunderstand what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| I'm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I just didn't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| I mean, we need to notify those dealers on Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| because they're the ones that have bought cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| They're the ones that send you to they send you the Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| County tags, unless that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| If I were you, I'd be driving on Knox County Tags, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| Doing all we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| My understanding is that you can request a Knox County tag if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| you buy over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| You have to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:40| Yeah, you have to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Well, you know, you just don't get to dump your garbage on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| And if they've got a Blount County tag and the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| office is talking to them, they'll be presenting a driver's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:50| So there'll be some form of ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| OK, Commissioner Smith, Mayor, would there be a way maybe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| you could pilot this between now and then, maybe test a side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| or two and just do them at random so you can come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| maybe get a little, you know, what you all what you guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| thinking with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| We are servicing a significant number of citizens from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:12| I can tell you that if you want a hard statistical data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| that's going to take us a while to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| But one of our biggest challenges in managing costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| right now is through our convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Every time waste management or waste connections raises rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| we're seeing more people come to our convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| And as a result, it's gotten to be a real strain on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| particularly at high peak periods like Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| This is a way that we can limit it to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Now, there are some other services that we will look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| serving anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| If you have a sick child that comes into our health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| department and you live in another county, we're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| to send you home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| However, if you want to bring your trash to Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| dump it, we've got to get a grip on that because the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| communities don't have some of the same services that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Once you have the officers there and they sort of do it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| random, the word is going to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| And when they see the officers there, I think it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| take care of a lot of the problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| We hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| But we need to, I agree with Mr. Pinkston here, we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| educate these other car dealers around here because car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| salesmen change quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| We just need to keep reeducating those dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Okay, we've got a lot of lights on and this is going to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| our agenda next month for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| So, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Yeah, I just wanted to say this is a lot bigger problem than we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| I spent a lot of time campaigning at the convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| center last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| There were a lot of Anderson County tags going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| convenience center and, of course, my district borders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| against Anderson County and a lot of the folks from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Claxton area, they come over and dump their trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| What my worry is, is that if we don't let them dump the trash in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| the convenience center, are they going to dump the trash somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| else in Knox County where it might not be welcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| And I'm wondering if maybe we could impose a fee for non-Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| County residents when they show up and charge them to, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| might also help offset the cost of law enforcement out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| We can certainly take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| That's an idea we hadn't considered, but we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And we'll present it to you next month, if that's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Okay, Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I own property in another county that one has a residence on, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| hence, we pay property tax there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| And the main service we get is being able to take our trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| there and take it to the convenience center, which we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| this last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| And even though they did have a sign up, they didn't check ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| But, you know, when you're a taxpayer in a county and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| a service, so this would be a little harder to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| But I guess if we had some means where people, in fact, own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| property in there, that might be a second home if they're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| taxpayer, and I think that's the goal, is whether they're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| taxpayer here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| The car tag is one way of sort of ascertaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| But when we first established these convenience centers, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| were having a lot of illegal dumping all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And this was discussed at the time, should we say it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| in Knox County, makes a lot of sense on the face of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| But if people are working here and bringing in, they're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| taxes here in one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| So maybe a notion that if they own property here and can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| substantiate it, maybe once they prove that, they can get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| permit that they don't have it on the car, but they can show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| that we own property here, therefore be allowed to dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| And if they're really living in another county and just coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| over here just to dump, those are the ones you want to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| away because they're not really helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Commissioner Lambert indicated that maybe a fee for it, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| think, may work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| He says, well, if you're from another county and you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| own property here, here's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| I don't know what that fee should be, but he said, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| you can go ahead and dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Here's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:07| You can take your choice to either leaving or dumping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| So that would defer the cost and, at the same time, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| not clutter up our highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| And that's one thing we don't want to do is clutter up our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| And that's a cost, too, because once you start those, that's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| expensive proposition, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| And we estimate that use of convenience centers has gone up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| roughly 100 percent since we first initiated the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| So it's more and more people every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| So the challenge is more and more every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| I just want to say something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We're going to have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| I've been here not quite three years and I've had more calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| when we talked about putting a fee on people to our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| you know, to dump there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| But we've got to stop these people from doing this or do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| And with that said, I'd like to make a motion to have a five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Who are you going to talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| We'll talk to you in the back room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Let's finish this one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:08| I just wanted to say that when a person from out of town who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| owns property here, if they've got Alabama tags and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| dumping at the convenience center and they say, well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| have a vacation home here in Knoxville, you know, then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| obvious they're paying property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Now, I fought the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I was probably one of the biggest critics of the wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| tax, but the wheel tax passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| If a person is at our convenience center with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Anderson County tag or a Blount County tag, then most often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| what you've got is you have a person who lives in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| County who is registering their car at a relative's home to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| avoid the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| And so, you know, that's where, you know, I could see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| cutting them some slack if they're from far away where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| may have a vacation home here, I'm sure, like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| Leuthold's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| But I think if they're here with a Blount County tag or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| Anderson County tag, they need to pay a fee to dump because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| they're either our neighbors or they're folks who are avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Commissioner Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Just one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| And I don't know how we do this, but if there's some legal angle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| then I really think you ought to write all the car dealers at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Border Knox County and just tell them that they have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| get Knox County tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| And I'd be willing to bet that that will take care of a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| We will certainly look at that and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| What are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| You had mentioned earlier that we're deferring the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| We're not voting on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| All in favor to defer to April, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| That's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Commissioner Pinkston, did you want a five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| We're almost through the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Let's get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| We've got zonings at four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Yeah, let's get this knocked down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| This is a consideration of an ordinance to adopt a storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| water management ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Voted 9-0 to defer to April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| 9-0 to defer to April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| I mean finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:24| I'll make a motion we defer to April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| 1-0-4 is amending Article III of the Knox County Procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Code as previously adopted by Ordinance 05-4-101 on May 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| The Procurement Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Procurement voted 5-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Ordinance 102 is to approve regulations for flood damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Let me, Bruce, you might want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| I think they had the wrong packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| There was a couple of different changes that were in our packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| to what they handed us at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| So that being the case, let's pass this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| That way next month we'll have second reading to give everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| an opportunity to look at and to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| So, did somebody make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Make a motion to approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:43| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| I have had a chance only to skim this one, but we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| the first draft of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| The first draft had significant merit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| We made some modest changes to it, that improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| I prefer the first draft of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I would offer a substitute motion that we approve on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| reading the same thing we passed on first reading last mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:10| Do we have a second to Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Any discussion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| We're moving to discussion to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Could you indicate what those differences are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| You're asking quite a bit to approve something, modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| First reading to your motion is to finalize this on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| reading, so if somebody could enlighten us as to what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| differences are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Well, if I could call to the microphone Jamie Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| She has been a diligent student of some of the differences in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| these floodwater ordinances, and she could explain some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| differences between the previous version and this version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| If you could give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Jamie Rose, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Last month, commission did pass on first reading the flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| damage prevention ordinance, and I ask at that time that the base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| flood be retained as the 500 year rather than changing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| which was in the 94 ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| At Intergovernmental and Finance, this past Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| both committees agreed to amend the document to define it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Now a brand new document is being introduced to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| In fact, for whatever reason, you didn't even receive a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| of this new document until I called it to the attention of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Mr. Vandervate, and you then got a copy of this at lunchtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| two hours before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| I've outlined some major differences between the new one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| that you've just been handed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I don't have enough copies for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| You'll have to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:08| I guess we're on a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| I'd just like to point out some of the major comparisons on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| list that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| In the first column, you have the 94 ordinance, and the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| difference between it and what you passed on first reading was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| the date for the FEMA maps, the base flood definition, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| floodway definition, and one paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| So you all amended it last week to leave the base flood at 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| years, so this is basically the document that you all passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Second column is the city 83 ordinance, but please keep in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| mind that the city, besides this flood damage prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| ordinance, has supporting documents in policies and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| land development manual so that whatever is the strictest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| they have on record is the regulation that they work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| So they have other regulations that supersede this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| In the third column, you have the county version of that 83| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| ordinance, but there's significant changes made in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| In the second, after the first underline where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| definitions, page three and page four and page three, reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| across the area of special flood hazard, in the 94 ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| and in the ordinance that you all passed on first reading, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| is defined as the land in the floodplain within Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| subject to a two-tenths of one percent chance of being equaled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| or exceeded in a given year, which is the 500 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| In the cities, as well as the one that the county is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| asking for, the area of special flood hazard is the land in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| greater chance, the 100 year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And then if I can turn your attention to the top of page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| the location of the flood fringe limits and floodways shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| shown on all subdivision proposals, regardless of size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| But yet in the version that the county now wants to pass, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| proposals that are greater than 50 lots and or five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| And then at the bottom of the page, prohibit encroachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| during occurrence of the 500 year flood discharge and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| increase in floodway widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| Yet the county in this new document is saying no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| encroachments unless the cumulative effect will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| increase the water surface level of the base flood more than one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| foot at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| On the next page, that entire section is not in the 94| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| In the cities, you'll notice that number two that has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| very specific and higher regulations has been omitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| from the version that the county wants to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| And the difference in that being in A, under the county, under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| the city's ordinance, it says the lowest floor, if no depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| level is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| be elevated to at least two feet above the highest adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Number three in the county version says the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| department shall certify the elevation of the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| adjacent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| On the next page, prohibit encroachments again with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| 500 year flood discharge and no increase in flood widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| The cities says located within designated floodways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| The county version says within regulatory floodway, which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| FEMA definition or word that they use, meaning the 100 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| That's a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| At the bottom of the page, no encroachment shall be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| width of the stream at the top of the bank or 20 feet from each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| side, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| And the one in the county says no encroachment shall be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:50| within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| That's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:02| Jamie, could I interrupt just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| I've been involved in stormwater and freshwater issues for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| large portion of my academic career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| When I start thinking about these provisions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| ordinance, I get glassy eyed real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:26| There seems to me to be a need for a dramatic need for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| kind of overriding principle to work on, such as and maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| of our folks in MPC could speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| I know they're heading in that direction or they've considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| these concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| And that is something like a master watershed plan or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| kind of comprehensive watershed plan that deals with flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| and stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| It seems to me we get into the minutia of these ordinances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| I just get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| I mean, I just absolutely get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| And I'm very interested in trying to support as many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| as we can for this county to enhance water quality, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| think enhances the standard of living for the average citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| But I am just getting lost in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| So help, I'm casting out a line to Mr. Donaldson or Buzz or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| somebody to come and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I just have a couple more paragraphs I'd like to say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:52| When you pass a weekly ordinance regarding flooding, prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| and damage, essentially you are shifting a financial burden to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| the county, the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| We're the ones who will be called on to make massive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| improvements to relieve flooding because of what has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Taxpayers should not pay the price by passing a document that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| you have not had time to diligently study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I respectfully ask that you consider voting for the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| reading on the document that you passed on first reading last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| month with the amendment that you approved at your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| intergovernmental and finance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| I've just got a quick comment, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| You know, we hire professionals in Knox County government to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| address these issues, like Chris Grandjew, and I think Chris does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| And that's who we have to rely on a lot of times because when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| we get into trouble, I mean, that's who we go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I mean, that's why we hire professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| So, you know, I say sometimes we have to rely on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| professionals that get hired in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| And like I said, I have great respect for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I guess, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Mark, could you come and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:33| And again, just to restate what I just said, is your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| involved in a type of watershed review process or land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| relative to watershed in some kind of comprehensive fashion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| We are to the extent that we review concept plans as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| come through the process, through the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| regulation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| But doing sector plans on the basis of watersheds is a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| that we want to continue to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| That's a lot different than dealing with the ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| you're dealing with here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| The ordinance that you have today is very technical, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| has to be technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| It's filled with definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| But at a more global scale, we do want to begin doing our land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| use plans with respect to the watersheds that exist in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| county and to build into them the sort of green infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| planning that we've been doing in the Beaver Creek watershed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| a way to address water quality and water quantity issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| So I think that's a pretty good model that we foresee taking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| other portions of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Apples and oranges to a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| This ordinance is very technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| The land use planning is a little more global, and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| to begin to think of the county as broken up into watersheds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| deal with those watersheds in a comprehensive way and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| build in the green infrastructure that makes them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Bruce or Chris, the differences that Jamie Rose pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| between this and the one that was approved last week with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| amendment at intergovernmental, which you agreed to, you agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| to those changes at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| What are the major differences, and why did you feel like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| needed to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| We were attempting to mirror more of the city's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| There are some typographical errors in the draft version you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| That's why we're only asking you to approve it on first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:05| However, if you want to revert back to your action that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| took a month ago and approve the ordinance that's in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| packet on second reading, we have no objection to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| So you don't have a problem with Mr. Harmon or Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Mark Harmon's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I think what you got in your packet, the big book, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| So we didn't want you to think you were voting on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| that was given to you in error that was not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Either what Ms. Rowe proposed, we actually think the new one in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| our mind, minus the typos, is probably more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| But if she likes that one, it doesn't give us great heartburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| either if you want to go ahead and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| But I think Chairman Moore made a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| We lean heavily on our professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I've got colleagues in the city that have done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| with our professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| I've got confidence in Mr. Weitrich and Mr. Grangew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| And so I think that if you want to pass the original one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| We just try to make it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| And that's what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I'm just wondering what are those differences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| What do they mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Because I want to make sure that what we pass is what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| and is correct and we can enforce it and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| In our mind, either would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| We were trying to make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| But I don't know that there's that much difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| But that's not as good as their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| But they're they're telling me the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| And I'm relying on them much like the chairman does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Chairman, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| I think there's obviously some reasons Mr. Grangew and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Weitrich have brought this new document to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And I would suggest that we pass this on first reading and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| we can debate the changes next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| No, Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| I guess I just want to make sure that Bruce understands that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| are going to have workshops throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Is that true, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Can you tell me what the schedule is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| We haven't established a schedule for the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| workshops as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| We are waiting for the Arcadis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| They are indicating that they're going to schedule a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| for the comparison of the two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I believe that's April 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| I want to make sure that gets scheduled before we schedule our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| workshops because I would like for that comparison workshop to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| take place first and then the county workshops that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| going to take in various parts of the county second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| One thing I do need to point out that is extremely important is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| that we have a May 5th deadline to adopt this flood damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| prevention resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Certainly taking this to the April commission meeting will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| keep us within that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| But this isn't something I can we can drag out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| We have got to have this thing at flood damage prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| ordinance adopted by May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I believe it's May 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Is Arcadis on schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Do you think they'll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| The preliminary email, I got an email that they've hammered out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| April 12th as the date that they would like to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| However, I believe they're wanting to have a joint meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| of city council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| So I don't think they've confirmed the availability of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| location, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| So they're working out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| But April 12th was the date that was thrown out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Here again, I'm just waiting for them to finalize those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| before we schedule our workshops because I'd like to do them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| after this Arcadis report because essentially that'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| additional information out there on the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Commissioner Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Janie, would you come to the mic again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| I get the more I hear, the more confused I get in terms of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| of the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| You seem to have indicated that the two versions from last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| to this month are somewhat different and you've read some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| of those differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| They're not somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| They're completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:09| I'll take your version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| They seem to indicate that we could approve what we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| last month in the second reading and be okay with them and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| But the question is, I have a hard time, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| comprehending their comments that either one is okay if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| are substantially different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| And, you know, if they're substantially different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| then we need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| If they're not substantially different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| then we need to take one that has typos out and not leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| typos in type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| So I'm at loss as to, and I just wonder whether Chris could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| I know the mayor has, I just wonder whether Chris could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| address some of those or not because I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| And I'd like to be clear what it is that we're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| before I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I think a lot of the, can you hear me better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Yeah, give your name too just so we'll know who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Chris Granger with Engineering Public Works, Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| A lot of these differences are the version that you got today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| that was supposed to be in the packet is, as other folks said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| it's exactly, it's the city's ordinance with some very minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| changes to basically say Knox County and to change the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| It was really the call for changing this ordinance in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| first place to reference the May 2, 2007 flood maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| A lot of these situations that Ms. Rowe pointed out are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| situations that simply don't exist in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| situations where there's only partial flood mapping available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Over the last ten years, we've done extensive flood mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| and updates to flood maps in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And the situations that are addressed there just don't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| So, functionally speaking, these ordinances have the same effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| They have no bearing on the key elements of compliance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| flood insurance program and development regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| And also, as a matter of point, the Stormwater Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Ordinance that will be before commission hopefully in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| month or so also would call to, would spell out the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| for site planning with respect to floodplain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| Chris, which ordinance do you favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| Well, I'd have to say either one, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Either one is legally suitable, technically suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| It's certainly simpler to pass an ordinance on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| today and get one thing off everybody's plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| We feel that's certainly adequate to meet the needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| flood insurance compliance in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| And that's the bottom line of why we're here in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| So, which one, if you were sitting on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| which one would you support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Otherwise, I don't know why you all gave us the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| I mean, if you, I mean, do you support the revised version of it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| We would, we'd support the revised, the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| And the mayor, do you support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| So, you think the second one's better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| I just don't think that we need to pass anything on a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| reading today at four o'clock when we have a workshop on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| at six o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| We don't have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| We don't have a workshop on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| No, we have one on the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| On the stormwater ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| That won't give any more clarity to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| No, it's just for flood damage in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I was thinking we may get more information this evening on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| Okay, we've got a couple more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Chris, what happens if we don't pass this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| I mean, insurance-wise, what do we face in terms of insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| We have to have this passed basically by May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| So, it could pass at the next month's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| But we really have to have these issues hammered out to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| to be passed and everybody be comfortable by the April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Okay, what does it mean for people that are trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| flood insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| I mean, there's just no coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| It has no bearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| The flood maps become effective May 2, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So, our ordinance needs to reflect basically we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| have a legislative recognition approval of the new flood maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| by the time their effective date passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| Okay, Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I give as much deference as I can to expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| But I also give great credence to my own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| And I've read through these changes and there are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| And I'm pleased that you would be willing to accept either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| I think the one that we passed that we amended to indicate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| 500-year floodplain where we so indicated is the preferable one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| and introducing a new one and having to wait until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| We liked the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| We amended the first one slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| We approved in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| So, I would hope that we would at this moment follow through on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| the one we passed last month, consider this a second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| and pass it and have it done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Okay, any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| I'm going to support the revised version because of Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Grandjew and County Mayor Mike Ragsdale were in support of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| And I think we need to rely on our professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| So, that would be on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Oh, yeah, we've got a vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Substitute motion is on the floor first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| So, the substitute motion is to accept the one that we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:21| As amended in committee and pass on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Pass on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| So, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2186)|

| 0:38:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I would just like to encourage administration and maybe Jamie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| and her folks to see what differences she's talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| and see if those can be ironed out before next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2303)|

| 0:38:31| Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Mr. Chairman, I've got a couple of things I'd like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I don't know if this is the time to do it or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| There's a couple of things that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| I think one of them is a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I think Bruce knows the typos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Well, page 15, item 6 is City Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| I think that should be county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| And page 11, section 11, each day such violation continues shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| be considered a separate offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| If we could make that may be considered a separate offense up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| to the director's discretion or some language like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| If you've got a three-day problem and it pours down rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| the third day, you probably shouldn't be fined if you're out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| there trying to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:28| Okay, we're on public forum right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| We haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| Original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| It's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Any discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Commissioner Mark Harmon votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Any other noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Anthony Norman, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Seventeen ayes, two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Motion passes on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I want to start off first by getting the law director to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| us a time chart for forming a metropolitan government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| You each should have received a little chart that my office has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| prepared, see if I can find mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| And basically it's a timeline for establishing a metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Several other things I'd like to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| First of all, to establish a metropolitan form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| you look to TCA section 7-2-101 at SEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| There is a recommendation within the statute that the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| government consider basically an exploratory committee for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:05| community to discuss whether consolidation is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| ought to be pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| The committee, this community committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| the exploratory committee could establish whether there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| sufficient support for the formation of a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| They could also have public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| obtain citizen input, and determine the possible benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| of consolidated government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| I mean, we've been through this a couple of times in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| County's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| I don't know that the last time we went through the unified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| government effort, this is a metropolitan consolidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| To establish a charter commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| it can be created by adoption of a resolution by the county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| the county's principal city, which here is the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| A resolution by this body would state that a metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| government charter commission is established to propose the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| consolidation of all or substantially all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| government or corporate functions of the county and its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| principal city and the creation of a metropolitan government for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| the administration of the consolidated functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Resolutions must state whether the members of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| commission will be chosen by the county and the city mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| confirmed by their respective governing bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| or whether the charter commission will be elected by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| countywide at-large election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| So there are several ways to establish the charter commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| when you're dealing with a metropolitan government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| If members are chosen by the county and city mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| the statute authorizes the county mayor to appoint ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| commissioners subject to confirmation by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| authorizes the mayor of the city of Knoxville to appoint five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| commissioners subject to the confirmation by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| The appointments shall be made within 30 days after adoption of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| the resolution by the last governing body to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| And if the members are chosen by a countywide at-large election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| the election shall take place no less than 46 days or more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| 60 days after the adoption of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| So there would be a special called election for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| And the county election commission would hold such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| The cost of this process is borne by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and it's anywhere between $25,000 and $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| the statute so allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| The charter commission shall be representative of all of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| of the county and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| and every effort shall be made to ensure that representatives of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| various political, social, and economic groups with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| and the municipality are members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| Just a couple of other notes of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| The members of the charter commission must hold an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| organizational meeting at the county courthouse at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| on the fifth day following their election or appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| The process once that commission is established and they have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| initial meeting has to be completed within nine months of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| its initial meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| They file the proposed charter, and within, see how many days it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| within no less than 80 days, no more than 100 days after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| proposed charter is filed, there will be a special referendum election on the question of consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:56| The establishment of the metro government does not change zoning regulations effective in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| or the county until they are changed by the Metropolitan Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| I've given you just a chart that outlines some of those provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| I'd be glad to try to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| But that just kind of lays out the process for a metropolitan government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| We have one in this state, and that is Nashville, Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| They have been a metro government for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| The statute was actually, I believe, passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| I believe it was initially passed, I wanted to say, way back in the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| I believe it was 1957 when the metropolitan government enabling statute was passed first by the legislative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:54| by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| It's been amended several times since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| But it basically provides that there will be the taxes are structured the same as they would be now for city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:11| The county charter, well, the metropolitan charter would have to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| And there are a number of provisions that would have to be included in the new charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| And the charter commission would have to address what to call the new government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:35| It would have to address the creation of the legislative body, its powers, organizational and operational procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| You know, what's the size of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| In Davidson County, I believe they have up to 40 or so members on their legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| You would establish legislative districts and determine and set the qualifications for the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| Establish the position of a top executive or administrative officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Set the requirements of that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| And there are a number of other considerations, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| One thing that we wouldn't have to work on much here is that you have to provide for the consolidation of school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:17| And that's pretty much already taken place by the fact that the city went out of the school business in 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Thank you, Mr. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| to give the commissioners a chance to talk to your constituents to see, down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| if this is something that we need to move forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| At some point in time, our community is going to have to have tax increases unless we find efficient ways to run government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| And I think now is the time to start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| And hopefully this commission will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| And I think the mayor is always looking for efficiencies in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| I won't speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| But a lot of people in the community is talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Just nobody has been doing anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| So I think in the next month or month and a half, next month is going to be a short month, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| moving the commission up a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| It may need to be on the next month to start the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| But with that, Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| We voted on this time and time again, it seems to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| It always fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| But I think if you truly look at eliminating the duplication of services, if you truly look at streamlining your government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| I mean, our county government is not set up to be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| It's set up for checks and balances and power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| But I think if you eliminate the duplication of services, and the chairman mentioned the schools are already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| you know, the hard part, it seems, is already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| We've got the police agency and with the pension that just passed, it almost mirrors the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| It's not quite, but there's not a whole lot of differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| That will be a hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Are you going to have one elected sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Are you going to appoint a chief of police and have a sheriff be a keeper of the jails the way it is in Davidson County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| That's not an elimination of duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| Things like that could cause this thing to fail again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| But if it's done right, I think it would be great for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| Speaking with one voice, trying to recruit business and industry, sustainable growth, good jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| I think it would be very advantageous for this community to look at one form of government if it's done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| Yeah, I don't think people are going to vote for it if they have to give up their right to vote for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| I've gone through three of these votes with regards to metropolitan government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| And a couple of things that I have learned as we've gone through these votes is, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| there are some questions that our citizens ask when we have this issue come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| And, by the way, there are a few issues in Knox County that will give people more passionate statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| and remarks than when you mention metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| The first one is, is bigger government better government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| And if it is, how is it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Just simply saying that it will be better, our people are not going to buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| We have to show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| We have to show them how the police department is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| How are you going to combine those two bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Who's going to be in charge of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| You get into the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| You get into utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| You get into general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| And that's just a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So I would encourage us as we embark upon this is that we look at it very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| that we look at it very methodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Because one of the things that people look at, and gosh, for those of us who have been here a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| we can remember Kaz Walker buying time on TV to speak against metro government back in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| But people are very leery of the fact that special interests are behind this, quote, metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| And I think that we need to show them very clearly that this is from the people and we're going to do what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| This will affect over 400,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| The other thing that I think people are leery of is that when we talk about metro government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| and this has come out of the last couple of votes that I recall, people seem to feel like that we've taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| Davidson County Charter, that we've marked out the word Davidson, and we've put in Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| We're a very unique community, and we have very unique needs, and we just have a very unique way of doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| And I think that we need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| And, yes, we can look at other charters as a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| But if the citizens feel like that we're just going to mirror Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| I don't know that they're going to buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| So I guess my bottom line is, is that I support the idea of talking about it in dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| I definitely want to talk to constituents, but I would encourage us to move carefully and methodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| Otherwise, we can see this going down the road that the other three efforts have gone down if we're not careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| and if we're not smart in how we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Although I don't live inside the town of Farragut, I do represent the folks that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| And I think it would be very important that we, if this were to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| that we include the town of Farragut so that they will have a voice in that charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| and whether or not they would want to participate in that or continue on with their own town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| and have their concerns voiced as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| I served on, as a county representative, on the unification charter provision, not the metro one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| Remember, that provision was passed into law basically for Knox County because they didn't find the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| metropolitan one sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| So that was the general state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| That's the one we attempted last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| But my main comment here is that the time limits, once you start this clock of movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| you think that nine months or so, and I think that's about the same on the unification one, too, is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| In fact, it was a very short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| And the thing is, there's many things that can kill this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| There's not too many things that will pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| And what you need to do is to remove as much as possible those things that are killers of this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:19| And the main one that I see that are killer is the putting together of the employee bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| and how that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Therefore, I think it's important for the executive parts of government of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| and Knox County to outline before we start the process how you go about merging these so that you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| employees groups out there saying, kill this thing, because they, in fact, will kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| And what amounts to those things need to be worked out, and they're not easily worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| Once you get over that and know how to merge those things, including the pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| and the pension system last time was addressed because I addressed it for several months on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| and we took people that were poles apart on this and came to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| The Charter Commission says, we don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| And I says, look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| If you have parties that are this far apart and where they come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| and they used all their expertise, their actuaries, their attorneys and everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| and you come to an agreement that says this will work, it probably, the process says it will work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| So there's many things that ought to be addressed first to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| And then you point a Charter Commission to answer some of those questions that people can readily understand, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| whether we keep the top cop issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| People can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| But the merging together of different departments require more time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| If we're serious about it, we will have that exploratory committee made up to try to iron these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| It may take a year or so to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| Once they get those things ironed out, that's the time to point your Charter Commission to take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| In a few months, you think, is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| It was a very, very short time because we were rushing at the end to complete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| And there was very little time at the end to really deal with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Because once this goes away, the Charter Commission is out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| There's only a few days, you know, a couple of months before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| There needs to be efforts to go out and tell the community what this does and what it doesn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| And it's a tremendous sales job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| And I don't mean that negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| I mean that very positive that you have to go out and you have to be able to address those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| that the citizens will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| What's this going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Well, some things you can tell them, and some things are looking into the future, where it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| The whole thing of efficiency was discussed at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| The notion of where this would save money, whether it's duplication, was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| I know we hired an outside firm to come in and study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| And while we hired a good firm, they didn't know anything about this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| And it took them a while to learn about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| And they used up most of their time just trying to learn the nuts and bolts about it before they could even come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| in and analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| So that one needs to be done early, not late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| We need to be looking at that study from the get-go, not three months before we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| We need to look at, you know, a year or so before we're going to vote to look at where the economies would come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| so that we have a report which the citizens of Knox County could rely on as to what is the effect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| So this shouldn't be entered into lightly because the worst thing you want to do is go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| and spend a lot of your time and effort like I did and have it go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| I mean, that's no way you want to spend your time and effort because you can put another 10 years before it'll come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| Basically, it's been about 10 years, and that's about every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I've been, Commissioner Hammond has been through three of them, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| Yes, there is a sparring, and you will have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| But it can be done, but there's a lot of legwork that needs to be done first before we vote on a Charter Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| That should be after we've ironed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Then we point the Charter Commission to members because they have definite deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| They have to draft the document, but the agreement should come early, not during that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| Commissioner Lutho, that's some great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| You know, I think as we look at this and move forward, I think if we put it out far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| like taking effect 2014, then you've got both sides of government that can start reducing the number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| and people have enough time to decide, you know, how a body's going to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| So I think instead of rushing it, whenever we can get this thing going, if you put it out four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| it gives people a little ease to work into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| I don't know if it takes that long, but it takes longer than a year, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| Commissioner Lambert, I just want to say I'm very skeptical of metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| I haven't seen a metro government plan yet that I've liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| Often it's been a consolidation of power rather than a consolidation of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| I would not support any form of metro government that terminated an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| and replaced them with an appointed official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| I think that Knoxville City and Knox County are really headed down a good path right now at partnering together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| We're getting our codes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| We're, you know, we're really working well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| And what I don't want to see is I don't want to see talk of metro government to disrupt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| I think that there's certain things that as a separate sovereign city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| and separate sovereign county government that we can work together on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| and then there's some things that we can keep separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And I'm just not sure if this is the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| I will be following these discussions pretty closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Again, in theory, I'm not against consolidating services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| but I just don't want to see this turn into a consolidation of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Clark, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Teresa Soggins, Knoxville Children's Choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| I want to first start by thanking you for putting us on the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3585)|

| 1:00:29| and appreciator of all the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| The skills they learn as members of the Knoxville Children's Choir positively affect every area of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:42| The Knoxville Children's Choir has been an unofficial ambassador for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3642)|

| 1:01:14| and the Tennessee Conference Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| We would be very happy if you would consider making us an official Knoxville ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| We would also like to take this opportunity to invite you to our 10-year celebration scholarship fundraiser dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3684)|

| 1:04:58| I was not a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3898)|

| 1:05:57| Hail the clouds of sin in heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3957)|

| 1:06:05| Drive it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Give the love we all want on this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Give us, fill us with the light of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3970)|

| 1:06:19| Come and join the chorus, the mighty, mighty chorus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| Wish the morning stars began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=3983)|

| 1:06:52| Hail thee as the sun of the sea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| Hail the clouds of sin in heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Drive the dark clouds out of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Drive it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Give the love we all want on this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4026)|

| 1:07:51| Light of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| I think we may have some American Idols in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4073)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you all for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:22| Can they come back next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| That's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Come back and do a whole show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| Okay, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Treva Castleberry, Adrian Burnett, PTSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| My name is Treva Castleberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| My husband, Steve, and I have lived in the Halls community for 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| We've raised our children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| We own a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| And I'm here today out of concern, concern mainly as a grandparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| And I'm going to refer to my notes so I don't forget to tell you a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| I really appreciate the fact that I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| It's the first time I've ever been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| So that tells you I'm kind of stepping out of my comfort zone, but I'm doing it on behalf of my grandchild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| and the children that I represent from Adrian Burnett and from all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| When Adrian Burnett was a four-year-old school, my son, Chris, entered there as a second grader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| Three years later, our daughter, Nicole, started kindergarten and went through fifth grade there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| And back then, I knew a lot about the school because I spent a lot of time there, but that was the 70s and 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:36| Now, I'm spending time there as a grandparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| It's the same school, the same structure, the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| In 1975, Adrian Burnett was designed and built to accommodate a student body of 500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:53| Ladies and gentlemen, that was 32 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| The concern I share today is for my granddaughter, as I said, but Rayanna is in kindergarten there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:06| She is one of over 600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| This temporary structure that she was in was to last for 15 years and accommodate a maximum of 500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:19| So we do have a problem just in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Last year, according to Knox County School Report Cards, Adrian Burnett had more students enroll than did Cedar Bluff Primary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:31| Cedar Bluff has just broken ground for their new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| In 1992, Adrian Burnett was placed on a five-year plan for a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| The five-year plan somehow has now become 15 years and counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| Deteriorating conditions within the school in 1992, rather than the overcrowding we currently have, back then, it put it on the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:59| Many of those same conditions still exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| A good example is there are drain pipes that run through the classroom, and during heavy rains, the sound of the rain coming through those pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:11| disrupt class and divert children's attention from where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| However, growth has created a lack of classroom space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| The solution has been, for all these years, portable buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| They have helped to ease overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| But in severe weather, those students that are out there in those portable buildings are brought into the main structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| and that in itself creates even more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| There's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| Along with the lack of adequate space for our students, you can imagine that develops other issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| From that overcrowding, we also have an inadequate amount of bathroom facilities, for an example, for students, teachers, staff, and volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4314)|
| 1:12:04| Adrian Burnett currently averages about 60 adults within the school per each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| They only have two bathrooms to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| But then consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| There are over 600 students there almost every given day, and they have two bathrooms for the girls and two bathrooms for the boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:25| Try to imagine it, 600 kids sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| It takes a long time to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I hope you take that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| As you can imagine, this alone creates daily problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| Our community is currently growing at a rate that surpasses that of Farragut and Hardin Valley communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| We have new developments in our communities that are going, in hours alone, Lowe's is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| We hear Home Depot's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| If that happens, the student body of our school is going to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| It's a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| We're going to have new families coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| And with that, it's going to make the situation even more desperate, because our school is so overcrowded now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| Where are we going to put these children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We do a much better job, if we could do a much better job, if we kept up with the current growth and the future growth of these communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:22| for projections for our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| Somehow we're not meeting that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| The children in every community in Knox County deserve the very best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| in both educational opportunity and in the environment in which they receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| They are dependent upon the Knox County Commission, the Knox County School Board, and the Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| They want a safe and adequate school to thrive in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| This is why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| I am asking you to consider and acknowledge that Adrian Burnett School needs to be put back on some planning board soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4432)|
| 1:14:01| Not next year, not next two years, but very soon, because we're outgrowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Our kids deserve better from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Let's work together to ensure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| I want to make my closing statement with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| At Adrian Burnett, the students say each day a mission statement for that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| This is the mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Adrian Burnett is a safe place where we learn every day how to succeed and be the very best we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:34| I ask you, each of you, to take those words to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| Let's be the best we can be by showing our students by the example we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| that this mission statement is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Today, I ask that you not allow one more year to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| without placing Adrian Burnett back on a system where they can have a new school built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| You also have some people with you, Kathy Dugan, the principal at Adrian Burnett, if you all want to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| We appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| It's a sad situation that any community has a school like Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| It's time that we address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| I can tell you that me and Commissioner Smith, along with the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| I think we all agree that we need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| We've got to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| You can count on us to try to help you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Mr. Councilmember, thank you for your professionalism, the way your presentation that you did, and to our principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| This is the second time that we've heard somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Did you hear what she had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| I feel like I've gone back to 1998, but it's sort of fun sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| And thanks for tolerating me while I watched the choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| And I've mentioned a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I think, by and large, the committee that looked at schools did a nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I've also made the point that I thought that one area that they may have missed, it might be Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| And I've asked the PBA to go back and look at that, and they are going to and get with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Now, I do think in the case of Cedar Bluff Primary, you have to look at the primary and intermediate school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| to look at the growth, not just the primary school, because you have several schools right there on that same campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| But we are fortunate in that we already have the land for a new Adrian Burnett set aside that you could go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:24| So that's some of the other cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| I visited Adrian Burnett last year, and I was taken aback by the number of temporary buildings that it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| and also the lack of the gymnasium that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| I was very impressed, I must say, with the quality of the faculty, the children, and also the involvement of the parents in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| So there's some really good things going on there, but we need to do as well as we can with physical facilities to make that work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| And, Mr. Chairman, I apologize for taking somebody's chair up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| That's fine, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| And, Ms. Castleberry, I'm assuming you were taking this same message to the school board, too, and letting Rex Stooksbury and the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| Now, could I add one other point on her comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| You said if it would help, you could take it to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| I don't know if that will help, but I'll tell you something that would, and that's taking it to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| Right now, Knox County school children receive $800 per child less than the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| Multiply that times 53,000 school kids, that's $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| We're not asking for anyone else's money, we're asking for more of our own money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| If we could even get to half of the state average per child, and that's something the General Assembly and the governor can help us with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| it makes that school go from something that's needed, that you may not be able to get, to something that's very doable very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:48| So a lot of people have done some studies on BEP recently, or lots of information's gone out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| but I can tell you that is the single biggest thing we need to do to improve the quality of education across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| get some of our own money back from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| No one else's money, send Knox County's money back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:12| And a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Okay, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| Henry Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:33| Okay, Mr. Davis, you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Hello, my name is Henry Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| I live at 8911 Fox Lowness, that's in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| Pleased to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I'm here today to talk about the unsolved murder of Johnna Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| On December the 6th, 2004, Johnna Berry was murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Far remains a mystery as well as who killed her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| The Sheriff's Department has taken over 200 samples for DNA testing at last count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| The TBI crime lab is coming to an end of those DNA samples with no match so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| What will they do if there is no match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| As you know, the Sheriff's Department has refused to allow America's Most Wanted and CBS 48 Hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| to do shows about the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| They say they believe the killer is local and they don't have the manpower to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| all the leads the exposure would generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| According to the Sheriff's Department's website, the department has 475 certified law enforcement officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| 450 corrections officers, and 75 civilian support staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| Out of that number, they don't have adequate personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| It's hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| The killer is local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Question mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| How can they know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Johnna Berry has lived in Bristol and Johnson City as well as Knoxville and has traveled to Michigan and Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| The killer could be from any of those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Or the killer, if he had been local, could have fled the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| How can they know where he was from or where he is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| The Sheriff's Department also talked about 200 DNA samples they collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| In the BTK case in Kansas, the Wichita Police and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation collected thousands of samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| As it turned out, not one of those samples was from the person who was eventually identified as the killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| We hear statements like, because they have the DNA, that means they will get the killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| In the BTK case, it wasn't the DNA that led to his capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| It's the fact he sent taunting messages to the police and the local media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| The police had BTK's DNA since the mid-1970s, and he was only caught last year because of his communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| There are thousands of cases across the country where the authorities have DNA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| but for a variety of reasons have not matched the DNA to the perpetrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| So having DNA alone is not always enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| We're also hearing from the Sheriff's Department, the TBI, and they're investigating local cases in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| Remember Randall Pettigo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| While that case was different in many aspects, the local authorities had no problem in questioning assistance from the TBI in those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| The TBI has 15 investigators in their East Tennessee office in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| and would think they could send at least one of those investigators to Knoxville to go over the case with Detective Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| There are many cases where another investigator takes a look at a case and found something that had been overlooked or missed by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| The family has asked another set of eyes to look at the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| What is the harm in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| I find a lack of urgency to find the killer perplexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| In a Larry Bible case out of Texas, Bible killed a young woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| and roughly two years later murdered three more people, one of them a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| There is no apparent concern among local law enforcement officials here that the person who killed Johnna could do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| I find that lack of concern strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| It's been over two years now and no arrests for the murder of Johnna Berry. The case is cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| I ask you to use your good offices to bring a change in the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| so the killer may be found and that Johnna and the Berry family can receive a measure of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4932)|

| 1:22:40| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| You know what? Taxpayers ought to really be mad at you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| You know, three-fourths of y'all, like I said the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| By the way, thank y'all for approving the time change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4968)|

| 1:22:59| I'd like to see y'all start about six o'clock in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| You know, I think it's very rude for these commissioners to be getting up walking around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| when people sit here all evening, all afternoon, to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| And then y'all got the audacity to get up, walk around like what people got to say don't really matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| Once y'all get finished with government business, what other people got to say, it doesn't matter to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| It's very rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| The taxpayers are paying every one of those seats that are empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| That's why people are mad at the government, Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| Man, let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5016)|

| 1:23:45| It don't take a genius to run Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| All you got to do is be a student and willing to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| You can't learn getting up out of your seats and not listening to what the taxpayers got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| Y'all here are the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| You want to start a metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| I don't see it ever happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Not the way y'all running business now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| So how would people want to go with a metro government when y'all can't even run a regular Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| You know, I heard another commissioner talk about checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| Y'all don't know nothing about checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| The mayor is trying to give y'all some checks and balances, but everybody wants to fight against one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| How can Knox County move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Y'all have already taken a ten steps backwards, and I don't mean, I'm not even talking about what happened with the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:35| I listened to 100.3 early in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Commissioner Hammond, y'all get an hour and a half of my time every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I believe between 6 and 8.05, whatever is important, you all are going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| And I heard Heller and Hill say one morning, you know, a guy may not talk well, but man, they could be some smart thinkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| All we got to do is think, see, because half of you all is moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5092)|
| 1:25:00| That's why I want a time change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| If we're going to run this government, run it at 6 o'clock in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| Have those meetings at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| I don't care if you don't leave it at 10.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Y'all taxpayers' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Y'all work part-time and make more than some folks in Knox County that's trying to pay property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| Y'all finna go up on 20% if they late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| But it's okay, because y'all can sit there and make the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| But somebody's going to pay a price for the penalties that y'all finna put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| But yet y'all still going to make nearly $24,000 while that woman or that man, Mr. Gilmore, trying to pay taxes, only making $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:38| It's easy to sit up there and say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| But I want y'all to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| Y'all approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| I don't want it to take forever to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I don't want y'all to sit and say, well, we got ordinance coming up right after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| First thing, y'all start hollering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| Even you, chairman, at 4 o'clock, we got to start ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5154)|

| 1:26:02| Y'all here for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| Ordinance don't mean it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| But what anybody come in here to say, it's important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| I can't wait for next year's election to come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5171)|

| 1:37:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| The staff recommended planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Can the staff or someone from MPC explain why the staff wanted that as opposed to CB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| Our preference for planned commercial in this site dealt primarily with hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| and that the planned commercial zone district would allow for a site plan approval through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5863)|

| 1:37:56| I'm John Hulse with Michael Brady, Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| The idea of dividing the site into half and only rezoning the front half would address that slope problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:07| And I thought we had that agreed with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=5891)|

| 1:40:32| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., I'm not here in opposition to the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| but Rinker Materials, our client, owns a rather large quarry that is directly across the French Broad River from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:49| The quarry has been permitted since 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| It is well disguised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Typically, Rinker does a good job of buffering its quarries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| They just wanted me to state that they hope whoever sells homes in this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| or proposed subdivision advises new homeowners that they operate a quarry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| They have at least 30 years of reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| The idea is they will be mining in that area at least 30 years in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| and I mentioned they've been mining there since 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| They just want this property owner and prospective property owners there to be aware that they are operating a quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:34| and intend to continue to do so for a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| and do not like people moving next door and then complaining about what's going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| and has been going on there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| We are not opposed, per se, to the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6105)|

| 1:41:56| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Arthur, what do you mine at this quarry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| It's limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| It's a rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| We started on the west side of John Sevier in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| This pit that we're in now was permitted then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| and we've been mining there for about five years in that particular pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6138)|

| 1:42:57| Careful, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| When you asked for your request of NPC to plan residential, you asked for what, one to seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| Or did you ask for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6194)|

| 1:43:19| And NPC, you all recommended five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| The commission recommended five units of the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| The eight units of the acre would have taken a plan amendment to designate that land as medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:32| and they denied that plan recommendation and went with PR at up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:39| Could you do seven units an acre without an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6219)|

| 1:44:34| and I'm just wondering if the five is going to work for him or if we might want to look at six or seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| and if we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| Commissioner Lambert, I don't think you do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| absent a recommendation or a proposal before you to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| I've talked to Mr. Diggs about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| He's going to try to make a go of it with the five in discussing it with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| If issues come up with that density, he will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| or may be back to discuss this with MPC further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| Is this a low density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| Is it already zoned low density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Or was it zoned already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| The sector plan permits low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| I thought if it's in the rule plan, you could only go up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| So why are we allowing five units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| It was previously designated in a sector plan as low density residential prior to enacting the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| So it's grandfathered in up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| This is not rural area anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| It's primarily suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| There's subdivisions all over the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| We have a plan that designates certain areas as rural plan and urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| I just think we need to try to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| But if it's grandfathered in, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6362)|

| 1:46:13| Request of John Worley for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| It will be located on the west side of Choptown Road south of Warrick Rudder Drive in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Seeing no opposition, 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| We make a motion to approve based on the MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| at a density up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| Seconded by Commissioner Hulston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6401)|

| 1:46:46| And it passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| And if we have no other business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070326part2?start=6411)|
