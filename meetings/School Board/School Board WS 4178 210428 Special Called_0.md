| 0:01:52| 10 a.m. on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| And changes to the agenda. Board members, I just wanted to note that you have received an updated copy of the general purpose budget by email today with a couple of technical corrections which did not change the major categories being considered tonight but simply finalizes the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=116)|
| 0:02:15| The updated copy is also attached to the electronic agenda. Are there any other requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=135)|
| 0:02:28| Okay, do we have a motion to approve? Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Ms. Satterfield. Any discussion? All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=148)|
| 0:02:39| Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you. And before we move to public forum, Superintendent Thomas, would you like to make a statement about our budget this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=159)|
| 0:02:52| Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. As you all know, this year has been a very challenging year as we've dealt with COVID-19 pandemic and all the disruptions that have been associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=172)|
| 0:03:04| But however, I am very encouraged by tonight's budget proposal and the potential to help us make progress toward the goals in our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=184)|
| 0:03:13| We are still awaiting the state PEP estimate for April. We don't have that yet, so hopefully we'll get that within the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=193)|
| 0:03:23| And that certainly will help us form our budget in a little bit more definite format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| But what you've got is our best estimate tonight at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| And our leaders at the state and federal levels have done important work to provide new funding for K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| And I believe these actions will help keep the momentum going as we move into this next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| We've not seen an influx of cash like this in my history, I guess, in terms of doing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| So, certainly very appreciative of the folks at the state and federal level for what they're doing for not only for our school systems, but public school systems across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=233)|
| 0:04:02| And as a district, we're also very grateful for the support of Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| One of the most important ways this community supports our mission is by entrusting us with tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| We are committed to providing transparency and accountability in connection with that funding, and I appreciate the board's support in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=252)|
| 0:04:21| Earlier this month, we hosted a community budget meeting at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| And one of the points we emphasized was that this budget proposal is well aligned with our strategic plan that the board approved in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| And I know you know the goals, but I'll state those in our strategic plan to increase student achievement, eliminate disparities, and create a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=273)|
| 0:04:42| And this budget takes several important steps toward increasing student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| For our high-priority schools, it's maintaining a 16-day contract extension that's helped to support the work of teaching and learning in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| It also includes funding for professional development and content area allocations that are important for providing high-quality resources and trainings for our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=295)|
| 0:05:05| and also for the purchase of necessary supplies and materials for classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| One measure that I'm particularly excited about, and it's a small one, but it's $60,000 is allocation for ACT tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| At our high schools, the parents know that ACT can open many doors for college scholarships and financial aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| and I believe this funding is an important investment in our high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| And that's actually something we started last summer, and I think the demand was far exceeding what we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| I believe we even added an additional teacher, so I'm really pleased with the fact that we can continue tutoring for ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| The district's also committed to eliminating disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| In the wake of COVID-19, we believe that meeting the social and emotional needs of students is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| This budget proposal includes a $3.1 million investment to add 49.5 positions to support the social and emotional needs of students and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=349)|
| 0:05:59| including the addition of nearly 25 school counselors and four social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| This budget also includes a $2.9 million investment to add 55 positions that focused on supporting students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=364)|
| 0:06:13| We're also committed to creating a positive culture for our school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| This budget includes an equivalent 4% increase to the salary schedules that would be provided to both certified and classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=377)|
| 0:06:26| as well as step raises for eligible certified and classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| In addition, it increases the district's portion of health insurance premium costs and provides an additional 21 contract days for our school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| Our educators and staff do outstanding work, and in my mind, they're the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| and it's imperative for us to recognize their extraordinary efforts in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| If approved, I hope these compensation increases will demonstrate our gratitude for their skill, commitment, and dedication to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=410)|
| 0:07:00| And before wrapping up, a few individuals I'd like to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Ron McPherson, our Assistant Superintendent for Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Joe Snyder, our Budget Director, and Joni Joyce, our Budget Analyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=423)|
| 0:07:12| They have worked hours upon hours, days upon days, weeks upon weeks, in putting this budget together, and as I mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| they're actually working on the budget we're finishing up, the budget we're recommending, and then the budget we'll be starting for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| So they're constantly in the budget, so I want to thank, special thanks to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| and also a special thanks to our senior staff who, again, have assisted Ron and Joe and Joni in preparation of this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| because, again, it's a process that involves all of our senior staff, executive team, in addition to our finance folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=460)|
| 0:07:50| So, with that, Madam Chair, I'll turn the program back to you, and we'll be happy to, our finance folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| and I'll be happy to take questions that you might have about the budget proposal, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| So, first we'll go to public forum. Ms. Babb, do we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Sure, we have one person on public forum, Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| Knox County, Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| I appreciate this opportunity to talk for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| As you heard from Superintendent Thomas, this is one of the better budgets that we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| at least I've heard, for the last 20 years, from Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| But it's also imperative that I bring to your attention today that we are still suffering as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| as one of the metropolitan districts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| When you think about the six major districts in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| when you think about Memphis, Shelby School System, Metro Nashville, Hamilton County, Clarksville, Montgomery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| and Williamson County, and then including us, we are number five out of those six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| when we are talking about salaries for your staff in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| Now, we've come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Under the administration of Superintendent Thomas, we have increased on an average of 2% every year of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| Granted, that last year we didn't receive, we received zero in the midst of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| that we thought the economy was going to be crashing on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| But when you think about the way this economy swung in the middle of a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| they actually outdid the unthinkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| But when I'm not only, when I'm standing here talking about educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I'm talking about every single educator in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| And some of the most that are hard hit are classified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| We have, if you have not, never had a conversation with a classified staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| and knowing that they are, majority of them are living at or below poverty level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| or they have a second job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| And that is not, that is very telling of our district when we're not able to help the most needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| Now, granted, the Superintendent Thomas did add some funds into this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| to help some of our classified as it relates to providing services for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| But when we have aids in our classroom from special ed, when we have a deficit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| when we have a deficit of those that are working one-on-one with our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| we cannot continue to do this to the people that are doing the very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| when we are ranked one of the top three in performances for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| I ask you, when you consider that when this, when we get surpluses of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| don't even, don't just think about educators in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| because yes, we will do deserve it too under this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| We have done two and three and four jobs under this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| and I know you all know this all too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| But when you're thinking about the budget, please consider those that are most impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| and that is some of our classified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| This 4%, it moves us the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| You've known also in this last three years that we have fluctuated between being 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| We went down to 29 when we got our 4% raise two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| and now we're back up to 36, ranking for educator salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| I don't like that number. I don't know if you like that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| I'm more like my all ball. I'm all ball. I want to be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| It doesn't take to be overnight to be number one, number two, or number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| but we want to be in that running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And in order for us to be in that running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| we have got to seriously think about this 4% moves the needle just enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| just to keep us from being at the poverty line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| I do not want to see any educator having to stand in line for additional assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| when we're helping our future of our students and this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=730)|

| 0:12:18| I thank you for all that you are considering in regards to this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and it takes a superintendent that has been in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| and has known what we are struggling with as educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| and how we can actually do something about our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| I know also it's not solely upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| I'm saying shame on the governor, shame on the State Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| and shame on our legislators, and more so shame on our commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| because they too have a responsibility for the community in which we are educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| You know that we are 67 plus percent of the employees here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| We've got to do better. We must do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| But more importantly, I want to say to you today is thank you for this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| because this has been a difficult year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| and more so is that we are going to accept what you give us and appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=802)|

| 0:13:28| Okay, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=808)|

| 0:13:42| We have a motion by Mr. McMillan, a second by Ms. Christie. Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Hi. Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| I just wanted to say, first of all, thank you, Mr. McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| for answering several of my budget questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| He was very patient with me and answered a lot of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| I am grateful. This is my first budget season, so it's definitely a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| And I just want to kind of reiterate what Ms. Coates just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| You know, our teachers are getting a 4 percent raise, which I am very grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| But we are last of the big counties for our classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| And while we are getting a 4 percent, while they are getting a 4 percent raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| several of the other counties are also getting a 4 percent raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| And it won't close that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| I would love to see a 5 percent for our classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| That way it kind of moves the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| I think that that would—we'll never probably see another budget surplus like this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| I don't know when the next time we'll see $39 million extra dollars come to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| And I think that by upping it 1 percent would have been fantastic in helping to close that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I've got just a few comments, and please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| One of the things that I was looking at was the total percentage of investment that we're making in our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| And if you just talk about total dollar amount between last year and this proposed budget, it's a 7.6 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| But when you consider the ADM, the cost per student that we're increasing is actually an 11 percent additional investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| which I think is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I think that's something we need to celebrate, the fact that we're investing 11 percent more on a cost per student basis this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=944)|
| 0:15:52| The other thing that I think is important to note is sometimes I think when we talk about additions without knowing how much we had prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| it's a little bit confusing, like the idea of 49 and a half social and emotional staff is an important number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| but how much did it actually increase us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| How much did it move the needle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| And that's a 34 percent increase from what we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| And so I think that's significant and something that we need to make sure people are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| And then in our special education, although we're increasing by 55 staff, it's only about a 6 percent increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| which is still something to celebrate, but I think it's important for people to understand the additions that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| and not just thinking about the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And then the other thing that I would say is I know we're looking at it and I know the superintendent is looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| but for our lowest paid employees like our custodians and others, I know there's been talk about moving possibly to an 8 percent raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1002)|
| 0:16:51| for that particular designation, which currently at 4 percent, it would be less than $100 gross monthly income on average for those employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1011)|
| 0:17:01| which isn't nothing, but it's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| So can somebody speak to us and to the public about what it would take for us to get there for that 8 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Mr. McPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson. I appreciate you mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| The three categories we're looking at, educational assistance, custodial, and it would be school secretarial positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| those are our lower paid positions from the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| We do experience significant amounts of turnover in those three categories, which presents challenges all through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| And so, yeah, we're always trying to look for ways to try to recruit and retain these folks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| So currently, as you said, there is a 4 percent recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| If we were to, there had been talk to move that up to an 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| That would cost, we calculated that at about $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| We were actually hopeful that we would have received a BEP estimate by now, but typically we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| So it seems a little late from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| And so I think Mr. Thomas, one of his priorities would be additional amount of funding from the state up to $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1095)|
| 0:18:27| You know, that would allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Now there are a couple of other potential options we could do to try to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| It could be, it could pose somewhat of a dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| You know, one of the things we could do would be, we've got $1 million set aside of uncommitted positions right now, 15 additional positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1119)|
| 0:18:49| Because typically at the end of the year, or at the beginning of the following year when school opens, ADMs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| I was writing membership enrollment, so we may have underestimated at some schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| And so there may be a need for a BEP, a teacher required for BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| Or there may be a need for ELL or special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Or, you know, we take another look at the staffing formulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| You know, there may be some positions there, you know, that what we didn't grant, we may want to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| So we always have those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| And so if, by budgeting for those items puts less of a strain on the following year budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| because otherwise when we would add those items, if they're unbudgeted, then we have to budget for the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| That's an option, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| We could like kind of switch that and kind of keep our fingers crossed after the school year opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| There, we, you know, we could, dependent on sales tax, we, you know, conduct the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| Do we, when the next data point, is sales tax significantly higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| It's trending in a very positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Might there be some movement that we could maybe kind of tweak those numbers a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| We would need to speak with the county about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| That does give us a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| Now, the other option, which would be the least desirable, would be to go back into the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| and essentially carve out $1.3 million of maybe another initiative that we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Obviously, that would be the least attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| But those are a couple of things we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Yeah, I'd like to see that kept on the table and us pay attention to that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| So, right now, our average educational assistant gets $20,643 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| How many, do we know approximately how much that equates to an hourly wage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| I don't know what their contract period is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Oh, gosh, I'd have to settle now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| So, custodial gets $24,538 on average, and our school secretaries get $25,740 on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| Probably not far above minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Obviously, nobody is satisfied with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| I just think it's important for people to be aware of to push on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| because, obviously, we need to do better by those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Yes, all I would like to say is that last time we were here and talking about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| the magnet budget was cut, and I want to make it publicly known that it was put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| So, thank you, Superintendent Thomas and Susan Horne, for giving that truth of your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| I'm glad you thought to bring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| And a lot of the other things that were cut, allocations to schools, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| have been added back to this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| So, that will be helpful for them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Okay, Ms. Babb, and then we'll go to Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Yeah, first off, I'm just thrilled about the 49.5 social emotional type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| I actually had one guidance counselor already reach out to me today to tell me how happy they were to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| because I have always heard the strain on that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| I think we all have, and I know this year has been especially difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| So, I think we're headed in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| and I think we probably always know that we continue to be able to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| I do have one question, kind of getting back to Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| I guess just for me to understand it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I do fully support trying to get the custodial secretaries, those kind of positions, pay up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| because I do think when you think about poverty line and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| it is tough to think that we have people living and working in jobs that they're not having a hard time getting by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| So, what I have a question about is if the BEP money comes in better, which we don't know today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| and we've passed this budget, which right now is at 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| can you all go in and make an adjustment for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Or do we have to say we want an adjustment if the 1.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| How does that work to be able to do that after the fact we've passed this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| I may need to defer to the law director here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I think if the board made some kind of a motion that if that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| that would be the priority we could possibly program that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Otherwise, we could just do a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| I think it is important to note that once the board approves the April, this is a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| it's not necessarily etched in stone, because we know that there are issues that arise throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| So, I think if we were to receive some sort of a direction that if the dollars come in at a certain amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| they be applied towards this category, we could certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| I think also, well, it would be, it's highly unlikely it will come in exactly at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| I mean, Joe's pretty good, but that might be a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| It could come in lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Right, it could be. I hope it's not lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| What we would do, I think, is we would, obviously, we would reach out to the board and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| these are our plans with respect to, and I think the county would obviously work with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| I don't really have any concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Probably need to defer to Mr. Dupler on what kind of formal action that might be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| I mean, I can't speak for the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Use your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| You know, I can't speak for the whole board, but just personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I do like the fact that that would be a priority if the funds are there to move it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| So if there's any way for, if the whole board feels that way, to let it be known, I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| And then I do think just also people need to know, this is just one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| I mean, right now, we are passing the budget for it to then go to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and then the mayor will formulate this into his budget, which then will go to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| and then county commission will actually be the ultimate voters on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Just making sure people understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Right, and I appreciate you mentioning all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| And just one other thing I will mention, and Mr. Watson brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| So if we are able to increase the salary for these areas, it certainly would help the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| but it would also help the district because we, back a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| we had 89 vacancies in educational assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| A lot of those were special education assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So by doing that, yeah, sure, it would certainly help the employee, but it would help the district too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| And we have a huge turnover among bookkeepers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| That can be a very technical job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And, you know, every time you have turnover, then you have a learning curve with the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| And so I think a case could potentially be made that we could, the more we could increase that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| there could potentially be reduction even in audit findings on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I think with custodials, we may have had 50-something, I think we've lived with 50-something vacancies all year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| Obviously, especially in light of what we went through this year with needing clean buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| you know, we need that force fully intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| So I just want to mention that, yeah, it would be a great gesture from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| but it would help the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| It would be very beneficial, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Since there aren't any lights, well, I'll just make a comment before I go to Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| So I'll just make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I agree with Ms. Henderson that it would be nice if we could do a 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| However, at the same time, I feel like these three classifications that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| that's where we really need to move the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| And if 1.3 million at 8% would get us to 8%, I feel like that would be really very beneficial for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1595)|
| 0:26:44| not only for our employees, as you said, but also for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| So I would like to see, you know, I'm in favor of trying to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| If people are in agreement, maybe we need a substitute motion to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| And also, let me ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I know it's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| The number of positions that were added after the fact going into this school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| would it have been about 15 positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| I know it's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Gosh, I may have to defer to Joe on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| We may have to count them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| I think it would be probably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Joni says 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| 34 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Okay, I knew Joni would know right off the top of her head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Thank you, Joni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Now you know who really does the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| So I will say I appreciate you putting in that million dollars to reserve that funding for those 15 positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| because I think that would be great to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| But at the same time, we know we have the other need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| And I feel like we've been kind of talking about it for a while, and it's an important need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| So those are my thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Let's go to Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Well, first, I think, Madam Chair, Mr. Dupre, I think Ron was actually asking how we could technically do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Could you give a little bit of enlightenment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Sure, Mr. Dupre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Thank you, Mr. Watson, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| So what's already been said is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I mean, Ms. Babb was talking about the fact that as of May 1st, this has to be in the mayor's hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| and then after that it will eventually go to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| So based upon that alone and some language from the charter and some ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| I mean, our recommendation is that you all come up with some type of specific numbers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| I mean, don't leave it open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Because what's happened in the past, and this board can certainly do this in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| is if there is more money available than over and above what's been projected tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| then this board can come back and say we want to do this with that money or we want to do that with that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| we want to increase salaries or whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| So that's always in the cards in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| But right now our recommendation is come up with some type of a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| And if you all want to change the numbers and do some type of substitute, again, that's up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| But, I mean, come up with some type of number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| So as a person that has to build budgets for a nonprofit organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| one of the things that I understand is that ultimately any budget that we have when we're trying to serve the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| it is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Our budget is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| And so our budget, I know tonight we're mainly talking about the numbers, the dollar and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| But basically what we're saying is we're going to apply a little more than half a billion dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| to provide an excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their fullest potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| And I think it's important for us throughout the year to be making sure that we're understanding the correlation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| between this budget and these dollars and the outcomes of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| And I know we can't dig into all those details right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| We don't have all those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| But one of the things that some of the things I want to highlight for some folks is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| right now in Knox County we spend on average about $9,000 per pupil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| which is far below the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| And so the reality is although, yes, we're adding 7.6% to our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| our pie is still not very big when it's compared to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| The other thing that I would say, because I hear this all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| is folks feel like sometimes our schools with the way they would frame it as highest needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| which I hate that language, are the schools that don't get as many resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| And the reality is that is true in some systems, but in Knox County that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Our highest funded school gets about $15,000 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| and our lowest funded school when you consider all resources gets about $5,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| So it's a $10,000 swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I think it's important for people to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| And then the other thing that I think is really exciting in terms of education finance data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| is in 2018 when the federal government mandated that we now have school level data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| in terms of outcomes and also finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| is now there's all this analysis that shows how much funding is a school getting compared to their outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| And there's a scatter plot that is now available for the state of Tennessee that shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| and I will send it to the board, that shows every school in Knox County on a four-quadrant chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| relative to how much it's funded and what their outcomes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And here's the interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| You would think that the most funded would generally get the highest outcome relative to, again, their student need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1894)|
| 0:31:44| So that's also considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| And the reality is that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| There are schools in every quadrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| And so the ultimate question, I think, for us as a board of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| in addition to how we help increase the pie, which we have little local control over but can advocate for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| is how are we best spending the money locally to maximize that outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| And so those are questions that I really hope that we can dig into over this next school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| is how are we allocating those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Because it's not just about sending more money to a particular school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| because we know that doesn't necessarily equate to a higher outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and we're already trying that in Knox County, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| We need to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I think we need to differentiate resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I think that's an equitable approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| But at the end of the day, I don't think any of us want to say, well, we just funded this school really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| I think we want to say we help these kids achieve their fullest potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And so, again, this is my first budget process too, Ms. Henderson, and I appreciate digging into the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| I love numbers, and I'm looking forward to opportunities where we can more correlate the budget to our outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| And I would also like to make a substitute motion that if our BEP funding comes in at a higher amount, $1.3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1975)|
| 0:33:05| that we allow for the adjustment in advance to be 8% for those three classification of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| Motion and a second. Motion by Mr. Watson and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| Did you get the whole motion? She's so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Okay, and Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I just have three short things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| First is a request for Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| I'm looking at the expenditure overview and the restoration of cuts and the contract days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| the 16 additional contract days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| What I would ask is that before adding back those 16 contract days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| that we really make sure we've had a conversation with the administrators and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| to be sure that those 16 days are what they feel they most need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| And then if that maybe is not what they most need, that we move those funds into other support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| Yes, ma'am, we'll be glad to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I don't know, Dr. Reis, if you could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| I know last year when we were talking about cuts and that was one of the reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| certainly heard very loudly from Mr. Lang-Lewis at Austin East and Ms. Jones at Vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| They were very vocal about the importance of getting those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Additionally, in terms of the training provides for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| but it also almost a month more salary, too, from the standpoint of helping keep the turnover down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2072)|
| 0:34:42| at the schools where traditionally there is turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| And you don't get that consistency in teaching staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| You train folks and then they turn around and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| And then you're training new folks and then they turn around and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| So you have that constant turnover, and this has helped us to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| But we'll still be glad to talk with principals and get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| To be clear, I'm not against those 16 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I just want to make sure that we're doing that in the best way to help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| I have a question for Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Also on this same page, looking at the content area allocations, last year when we cut those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| we didn't put those back last year at all, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I'm sorry, is it possible to use ESSER funds, ESSER III funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| to put some of that money back into the classrooms that they could use next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| What I'm thinking of is things like art supplies and all those things that get used up, they also build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2139)|
| 0:35:48| And so they would have used their resources, and I'm guessing that things are getting in short supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2148)|
| 0:35:58| We would have to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| I know with every iteration of ESSER, there has to be some sort of alignment with the disruption caused by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2160)|
| 0:36:10| We could say, if we were to say, okay, this was a disruption caused by the pandemic because we cut the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| The problem I think we would have there is it could potentially be viewed as supplanting rather than supplementing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| because we had it in our budget, we cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Now we're kind of going through the back door using those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| I don't want to absolutely say that it would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| I do know with ESSER III.0, we know that the monitoring is going to be extremely diligent from what we've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2197)|
| 0:36:46| In fact, we've been told that we need, we've been strongly advised by the state, all districts have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| to actually use a portion of their ESSER funding to actually hire and monitor because they're going to look at it so closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2211)|
| 0:37:00| So what I would suggest is not only, so this is just me, to put it back into the budget so it could be recurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2220)|
| 0:37:11| because once it leaves the general purpose budget, when ESSER, even if we could use it for ESSER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| then we kind of get into, okay, at some point we've got to put it back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| and then it kind of puts schools in peril of never getting those dollars back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| We could look at, however, kind of creative with ESSER III.0 if we were to put these back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| to actually look at how we might can supplement some of those needs that you talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| that could potentially give schools even more options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| So, I mean, we'll absolutely take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| And I definitely don't want to take it out where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I want to keep it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Just supplement on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| I don't want to add on top of that with ESSER funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Well, okay, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| I wasn't looking at moving it over into that column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| But adding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Well, yes, and I think everything's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| So with ESSER III.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So the deadline for application is in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Obviously way before then we'll be speaking to the board about, okay, here's some of the thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| Here's some of the options for ESSER III.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Here's where we think using the dollars in this particular area could take us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| with respect to achievement and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Or here's another group of dollars we could kind of go in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So I think we're going to, we will have, we will devote time, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| to go through this with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So the board will have strong, strong input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I know Mr. Watson has mentioned, you know, that to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| Because it's $114 million, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| And so we're taking a very critical view of what we can use those dollars for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| So we'll be having a lot of discussion, I think, about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So we'll definitely take that under consideration too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| And the last thing that I wanted to look at, and this is really the only thing that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| if I were looking to change one thing, looking at the school security days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| I appreciate the move from 200 to 221 days so that their training can be outside of the 200 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2355)|
| 0:39:24| What I would ask is if we could look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| and consider changing it to fewer days, possibly a third of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| and spend the other two-thirds to add three more social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| And I don't want to make that as a motion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| That's something that's going to take some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| and potentially look at an amendment in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Yes, ma'am, I'd be glad to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| And part of the extension for the 21 days, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| we have constant turnover in our security officers, and I think we have vacant positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| I'm not sure, Russ, you probably know the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Vacant positions, positions we couldn't fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| So part of that is the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Go ahead, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Well, I just want to say the reason that there are several reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| that we're making the proposal to extend to 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| One is it's part of our strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| is to reduce the turnover and the turbulence in our school security staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| and to try to get our school security staff to a pay level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| that is more consistent with the local market as far as what is required in security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| or what security officers can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| The other piece, when we talk about turbulence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| is our school security officers have to go through a 10-week training process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| before we can bring them on and put them in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| We're only able to run that academy about once a year, and we'll run it from May to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| So when we lose people during the school year, they're gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| and that's a hole that we have in our staff until we're able to run another academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| So we started this year basically where we should have been and where we were staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| I can tell you, based on the numbers I saw an hour ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| we're at about 93 officers right now, and we're authorized 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| So that's what our attrition has been to this point in the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| and a number of folks wait until the end of the year to tell us they're not coming back next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| So that's the hole we're starting with today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| and I don't think it's going to do anything but get a little bit deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Our goal is to try to reduce that turbulence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| This will also allow us to do our training generally outside of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| and that way we're not having to juggle officers around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| in order to make sure that they can make their qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| and they get their professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Plus, we also have school security requirements at various times over the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| and it will allow us to do some of that work within the contract rather than on time card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| Let me just add, too, we'll be glad still to put our rationale down for this and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| and if we can do anything different, we'll be glad to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| but to make sure we respond to you and to the board with what you've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| And if we want to look at some additional positions, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| as we get a better handle on revenue, maybe that's an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| even if we don't make an adjustment in school security officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| maybe we can still make an adjustment in the area that you would like for us to make an adjustment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| because we do need more in terms of social work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| The only other thing I would look at is if we have those positions that we've accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2582)|
| 0:43:12| that we may or may not need, if we could look at moving those to social work positions in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| I think that would be helpful, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Mr. Watson, Ms. Christie hasn't had a, yeah, let's go to you, Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| because you haven't gotten to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I was just going to speak to the SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| You know, they work really hard to develop relationships also in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| so when we lose them, you know, we lose those relationships they have built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| And, you know, talking about being short now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| I know that one of my officers who is well-loved by many of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| has had to go to several different schools this semester to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| And, you know, I've had kids mention that to me at the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| so that's also something that probably needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| I agree, Ms. Christie, and I appreciate you putting a measure into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| that hopefully will make it more attractive for officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| to want to stay with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| and we'll probably need to look even next year at increasing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| so that we can keep those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Mr. McPherson, this is a quick ask, I think, related to the ESSER funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| So what I've heard from education finance folks is that, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| ESSER 3.0 provides a lot more flexibility than 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| I don't know exactly what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| and what I would love to see before we get into these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| with administration and the board is if you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| instead of us reading all the many, many, many pages of guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| which I think we can, and I'm certainly open to doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| but don't know that I'll understand all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| if you can make kind of like an ESSER for dummies kind of little cheat sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| that kind of breaks down some of those big, high-level points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| that we need to be aware of as we're helping guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Knox County Schools in making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| We'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Ms. Coatney, can you read Mr. Watson's motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| To approve the fiscal year 2022 general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| at the major category level for $542 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| and if BEP funding comes in at a higher point at $1.3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| that it be applied to an 8% salary increase for teaching assistants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| custodians, and school secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2746)|

| 0:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| So essentially, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| your motion then leads the $1 million that's set aside for noncommitted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| It leaves that in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and the raise for those employees would go to 8% only if it comes in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| above the 6.3 or whatever the BEP funding dollar amount was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Is that your intention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2779)|

| 0:46:22| I'm not a gambler, but I'm kind of riding that this thing is going to go –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| continue to go a little bit better than what we had hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| And I don't have the history on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| but I would assume there's always positions that we've just got to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And I think to take that money away when –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I think it might pinch something else that we don't want to pinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2800)|

| 0:47:43| So we've had some rough conversations in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| So that's our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| So we'll move to board forum if anybody has any comments for board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2875)|

| 0:48:00| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Nutrition and capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Item seven, approved fiscal year 2022, capital budget for $58,325,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Mr. McMillan, with the motion, and Ms. Christie, were you the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Mr. Oaks, this is just clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| I know in our budget meeting, and for those who don't know, like 10 of the staff meet with each individual board member for a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| So, again, I just wanted to say thanks again for all the meetings and the answering of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| I know when we had our meeting, you had had some thoughts and discussion possibly about potentially applying some funds to build an additional school in the future out of ESSER funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2923)|
| 0:48:56| Is this capital plan assuming we're going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| This capital plan is built based on using the state and local dollars that we receive and is built on basically using municipal bonds or debt in order for those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2942)|
| 0:49:21| If we were to do anything in the capital plan with ESSER money, then we'd have to come back to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| and I fully expect that we will have to come back to the board at some point over the next six or eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| and talk about how to re-wicker this plan a little bit if we decide to use any of that money, ESSER money, within the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2974)|
| 0:49:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=2986)|

| 0:50:12| We have a motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Ms. Christie, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3017)|

| 0:50:28| And that is the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Now we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Any comments for board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| I just wanted to say again thank you for Ron and the staff for helping us through this budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| One thing, you know, because everything to me is kind of a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| And I do know that there is a budget committee that is made up of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| And I do know that we have committees, you know, like a naming committee and other sorts of committees that also are board members and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3056)|
| 0:51:05| And I didn't know, maybe this is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| I don't know if I'm just trying to make this a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| I don't know if there was ever a committee, a budget committee that was made up of board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3070)|
| 0:51:19| I know that we received this packet on Friday and I would love to have had a little bit more time to go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| And I didn't know if that was ever in consideration, a committee made up of board and staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| This is such a huge part of our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Mr. Dupler, do you have any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Well, Ms. Owen has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| I think it might have been helpful if we had had a presentation of this in a work session before tonight so that we could have gone over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3112)|
| 0:52:03| And as a board, I think we have confused our staff, possibly, because we've asked, we've told them we don't want a bunch of great big PowerPoint presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3123)|
| 0:52:17| And Ms. Bounds will correct me if I'm saying this wrong, because this started many years ago when we were saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| it's PowerPoints, PowerPoints, PowerPoints, and all these huge long presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| It's not that we don't want to see long presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| It was the presentations that were happening around 2010, 2011, those kinds of things that were almost seemed to the public to be for the purpose of making people not want to attend the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3157)|
| 0:52:57| We'll just go ahead and put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| You know, obviously, those are not what we want to see, and I don't think we saw those on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| It was other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| And definitely those have gone away, which we appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| I can't say we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| I appreciate very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| However, there are long presentations and very detailed presentations that I think we do need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3194)|
| 0:53:23| And so I think, you know, if the staff understands that purpose, you know, it's not that we refuse to sit through a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| It's that we want to see the things that are urgent and that are meaningful and that you feel like we need to see and that we need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3212)|
| 0:53:43| And I think that will help all of us understand the nitty-gritty pieces of the budget and also help the community understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| So, Ms. Owen, are you talking about in addition to our individual meetings with the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| So do individual meetings plus do, like, a work session before the call meeting or just do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| Usually in the past we've had this presentation in work sessions prior to our actual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| And let's see, we had budget presentations a month before the actual budget approval in at least 2011, 12, 13, 15, 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3254)|
| 0:54:27| So I think that would be very helpful if we could see this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| But there are lots of things in here that we talked about adjusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| And those are things that, you know, maybe would have been adjusted between that presentation and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I think all those comments are valid, and I feel that too, especially as a first-year board member, not in the sense of not being able to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| But there's limited influence you can actually, and input that you can actually provide at this stage when we hear about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| But the other thing that I, this was my first experience, was kind of trying to walk with the public through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| And I think we all have to admit that when we had a budget meeting just two weeks ago or whenever that was, I mean, there's a lot of things that have happened since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3311)|
| 0:55:24| There's relatively little to no direct impact the public can make on the budget at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| I mean, it's just, and so what it ends up becoming is, and I don't think this is intentional, it ends up becoming us as a system elevating our priorities to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3328)|
| 0:55:38| And in some ways I think that's backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| And what I would love to see, and this has been pointed out several times in this meeting, is that Joe and Joni and many others work on this budget all year round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3341)|
| 0:55:51| I would love to see six months prior to this presentation a public meeting on the budget where obviously we don't know all the revenue projections at that point and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3351)|
| 0:56:02| But the sole purpose of that public meeting was to be able to elevate the public's priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| And say as you're working over the next six months and as you're getting revenue perspective and projections that you can take into consideration some of what we're saying as public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3367)|
| 0:56:19| And I think one of the reasons we have so little participation in our public budget meetings is because honestly I feel like the public feels like they have no power in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| I was there even as a board member and felt like at that stage I couldn't speak meaningfully into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| And again, I'm not faulting any person on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| I just think all too often we want to get more of our numbers exact before we present and say here's what we're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3403)|
| 0:56:52| And what I would like to do is shift the priority and say let's elevate the public's priorities six months in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| And that way we can hear those and be attuned to those prior to actually setting out the priorities for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| I'm thinking about our, you know, we did a lot of strategic plan meetings and took in public feedback then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| And our budget is to support that plan, that strategic plan that we have in place which did involve a lot of community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| So just to, you know, just to kind of raise that because that's, there was definitely a lot of public input in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| I'm sorry, it felt like you were directing that to my response and so I wanted to get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| And I agree with that and I think that's really positive and something we need to keep doing whenever we enter into formal strategic planning processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3462)|
| 0:57:50| But we also know, we've seen it this year in this budget, this budget increased by 30 something million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Now we didn't know that six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| But I still think the public year to year should have an opportunity to elevate their priorities in addition to every five years when we develop a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3479)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| I'm not sure whose light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| I think Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Yeah, I would just like to make a suggestion maybe off of what Mr. Watson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| I got to attend the meeting last night and was lucky enough to be in the academic session which actually had great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3497)|
| 0:58:26| I was thrilled that I picked that one to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| And in it, we really did ask for feedback and it was a discussion instead of a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| And I think maybe that's a little bit where Mr. Watson's going is almost a have us talk about our priorities and then have some maybe breakout sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3515)|
| 0:58:45| where really community members that really are wanting to engage and want to talk about it could feel like they can actually have a dialogue with us rather than just be presented to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3525)|
| 0:58:55| I don't know if that might be sort of touching on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| But I have to say, like, I was very impressed with the session I got to be in last night that was actually led by Shannon Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| And it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| And I learned so much about what we're doing academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I just wanted to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| And I agree with Mr. Watson completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| I think that having meaningful discussions year round is beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| I'll put it in perspective of PTO days since that's relative to what I was doing before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| You know, when we would, you would have, you'd have people come to the PTO meetings, but the decisions were already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| Here's the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Here's who's going to be your new executive board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| That's a meaningful conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| And so then we started doing coffee chats, roundtables with the community, with the business leaders, with the parents, with all the stakeholders of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3584)|
| 0:59:54| And then it transformed into something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| And it became a completely different conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| And then everyone took ownership of that school support organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| So I completely agree, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| And this is half a billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| You know, this is everybody's community, everybody's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| And I think we do need to have year round those meaningful discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Great suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Maybe we'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Maybe Ms. Kelly can take a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| We'll go back and look at the calendar and see one, what the best timing would be for the finance team to affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| And also just to get, to see where it would flow with the rest of the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| Be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| One comment or question, just because I like to hear Mr. McPherson say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| So can you tell us what our monthly payroll is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| Because I always hear, oh, well, the school system gets all this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And a lot of times when I repeat that number to people, it is shocking to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| I'm doing this off of, I'm going to say, and Joe or Joni, jump in and correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| I'm going to say it's upwards of $35 million plus monthly payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| That's a huge number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Mr. Dupler, would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Well, I was just going to address, I think, the question that was originally posed by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| I think our office would caution against having a committee of board members and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| According to state law, ultimately, it's the director of schools, in this case, Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| who is tasked with promulgating the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| But I think the suggestions about wanting to meet earlier and meeting at certain periods around the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3706)|
| 1:01:56| that's not a problem at all for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I mean, the board could ask questions and be involved in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| It's just a committee would probably not be the preferred way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210428-special-called?start=3721)|
