| 0:04:53| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, articles of organization for the LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| and approvals from building inspections, fire prevention, and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| Mr. Thompson, how are you doing on getting those accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| Sorry. I'm outside, and a windy gust just happened when he said that. Can you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| How are you doing on getting those items completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| Tell me which ones you're lacking on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| You need sales tax registration, your LLC articles of organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| your building inspection, your fire prevention, and your health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=329)|
| 0:05:47| Okay, so I just only heard sales tax and LLC articles of organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Am I still on here? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| You're still here, so you need your sales tax registration, your articles of organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| your building inspection, your fire prevention, and your health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| How are you doing on getting those accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| The first two we have. I can get you copies of those, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| The building inspection, can you tell me, is it the same thing as a CO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| I'm not sure what you mean by CO. Mr. Byrd, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| I am. It's a little different. From the building inspections folks' perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| a beer inspection would differ from a final inspection or certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| but you'll just want to give them a call to set it up if they haven't seen what all they need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| Who would I call for the building inspection? Is that the city engineer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| I'll tell you what, Mr. Thompson, we've got other agenda items, so let's go ahead and move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| but you can call Mr. Byrd after the meeting tomorrow during regular business hours and he can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| Okay, I'll turn this over to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| Before I make a motion, I'd like to ask Mr. Thompson, out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| could you tell me briefly how you came up with the name? It's pretty interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| Sure. Well, my wife came up with it, but it's about the legend of the founders of Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| We haven't announced what we're doing yet to the public, but I know Knox News has put a few things out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| but it's the founders of Rome. There's a legend about the two brothers named Romulus and Remus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| Okay. And they were raised by wolves. And it's on the crest of Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| It's like in everyday Roman life. It's everywhere. You see it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| Okay. That's what I thought. Very creative. Kudos to your wife. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| And good luck with everything. I'll go ahead and move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210420?start=490)|
