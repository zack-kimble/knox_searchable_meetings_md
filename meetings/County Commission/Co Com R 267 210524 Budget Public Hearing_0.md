| 0:02:13| Your address, too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Your address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| 4400 Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| I come before you to ask for support for the budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| to give our county officers the extra three steps to upgrade their pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| The reality is they've had a bad year through COVID, just like we all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| but we're still dealing with a crisis in recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| that's affecting law enforcement nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| 75% decrease in law enforcement for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| We're still dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| There is a migration in law enforcement as other agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| they have a bidding war to attract new hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| because many agencies across the country aren't filling their ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| The Sheriff's Department operates with a shortage now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| They don't have as many people in patrol or CID that they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| We ought to be offering incentives to keep them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| Also, in the future here, if you read the economic news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Bank of America is predicting a hyperinflation rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| which means the dollar is going to lose its buying power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| We don't want to leave our officers without the means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| to be able to continue their way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| We want to be able to keep the sheriff's officers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| because Knox County law enforcement, city and county both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| have an excellent training academy reputation across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars between two agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| to train officers that end up sometimes leaving to go other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| just simply for better pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| We want to be able to raise our standards here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| so we can train our officers here and keep them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| We ask you to support the additional 3% to the officers' raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Thank you, Mr. Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| That includes item two on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Sorry, I know I signed up on Friday to speak to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Was there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| What's your name, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| John Mark Wiggers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| You signed up related to item 104, which is on the commission agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| not on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=258)|

| 0:04:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| I was told to sign up for agenda item four, which was the budget, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| On my list I have signed up for related to item R21-5-104,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| which is item number four on our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| That's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| I was intending to sign up for the budget, to speak to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=288)|

| 0:04:52| Is that the same for Bonnie Graham as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| I'll move you to this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| If you would, please state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| We're going to put a timer up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| You have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| I'm John Mark Wiggers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| I live at 3704 Garden Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| I'm a Knox County resident, and I've been a priest at St. James Episcopal Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| on North Broadway for about 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| I'm here to speak on behalf of the organization Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Against the proposed budget, especially the proposed general fund budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| even though the budget proposes $96 million on public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| and $23 million on public health and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| this budget props up a broken, often incoherent system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| that sends people with treatable mental illness to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| The system robs people with those mental illnesses of their freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| and it leaves our community unsafe and unhealthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| and the system wastes taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Justice Knox consists of faith congregations from across Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| who have joined together to live out the mandate to do justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| and altogether our congregations represent more than 10,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| from all parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| A representative delegation is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Could you all stand up just quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| So on May 3rd, 1,070 Justice Knox leaders came out from all parts of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| to propose best practice solutions that would save the county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| while keeping our community safe and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| I can tell you a story from my own congregation about mental illness and incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| We mentor people coming out of prison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| and my wife and I were working with a gentleman who needed regular antipsychotic medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| as he was coming out of jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| but because of various barriers, it was difficult for him to get his medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| in a timely fashion after being released from prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| And we knew that if he didn't get that medication, he would wind up back in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| And because I have quite a persistent wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-budget-public-hearing?start=408)|
