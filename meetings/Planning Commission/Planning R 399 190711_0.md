| 0:01:28| Many of the items we vote on require further action by city council or county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=88)|

| 0:02:21| After each item is called, I will read the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| On certain items I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=149)|
| 0:02:38| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| I will then ask for other comments from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| The opposition also will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| If either side wishes to rebut, you will need to reserve time from your allotted five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| And this is something new that we are implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=178)|

| 0:03:17| Speakers should limit their remarks to the facts of the case and should avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=197)|
| 0:03:26| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item are asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=213)|
| 0:03:42| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| You will need to state your name and address for the record, along with doing the sign-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=227)|

| 0:06:50| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| Madam Chair, if you don't mind, I would like to add also number 46 on postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| This is the Crescent Bend project, and I would request that staff meet with legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| to see what our authority we have to change the one entrance on Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| to a right turn instead of a left turn out entrance, so I'd like their opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| So I would include number 46 on there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| We've been working on this matter for several months now and actually met with MPC professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| on multiple occasions coming up with the concept plan for the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| and my client and his engineer also met with Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| and we're not agreeable to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Obviously, this commission can make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| I think the issue with the right-in, right-out turn that Commissioner Phillips has brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| is the neighboring track had a use on review approval back in 2012 for a Weigels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| and there's an access there, and so our original plan had a right-in, right-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| but we have to comply with the already previously approved plan that was approved for Weigels back in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| and so that is why the access is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| I would like to discuss it, like, when it comes up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I don't see any reason to why can't we just talk about it when it comes up instead of not even hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| And then if we want to postpone it, then we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| We'll have to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| We'll have to remove it from consent and then hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I'd like to make a motion we remove it from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Let's wait until the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Commissioner Roth, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Do Commissioner Phillips, are you wanting to add number 46 to the vote on the 30-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=554)|
| 0:09:24| or are you good to remove it from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I think if we can move it off of consent and discuss it then, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| So I'll withdraw that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| We can postpone it at the end, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Okay, currently we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| a second by Commissioner Roth to postpone for 30 days item number 7 and item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=587)|

| 0:17:21| Is there anything else to be removed from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| I do want to reiterate that once we have voted on the consent list, there will be no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| I was going to ask, when we were doing the postponements, I thought the Amerigo was added to a postponement and we just read it on the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1051)|
| 0:17:42| There's two different Amerigo projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1062)|

| 0:18:15| I didn't get a chance to get in touch with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| When I called him back, he wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Can we pull it off consent just in case he shows up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| So would you add item number 50 to your list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I'll amend my motion to include item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I'll amend my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Roth to hear consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1116)|

| 0:18:55| I was wanting to request a 30 day postponement for item number 40, TM3 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| We'll hear that at its regularly scheduled time and you can request a postponement at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| I sent an email request yesterday that said I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| They're on item number four on the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| I did not receive the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| A day before the meeting to request a postponement is a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| Your appropriate time would be to make that request when the item is heard on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| We were instructed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1170)|

| 0:19:34| I'm sorry, I did not receive your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| Okay, we still have a motion to approve consent by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1179)|
| 0:19:48| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1190)|
| 0:20:03| Okay, we're in business, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| We're going to start with item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| This is a concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| The subdivision is OT Tyndall Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| The applicant developer is Tarantella Construction Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| The location is the south side of East Beaver Creek Drive west of Dry Gap Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| Approximate acreage is 6.59 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1235)|

| 0:20:53| The number of lots is 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| There are two subdivision variances required and the staff's recommendation is to approve variance one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| and the proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Also to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| and finally approve the development plan for up to 31 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1290)|

| 0:22:43| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Roy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| My concern is the back of the property, a property 100 feet from the very back end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| water coming off of the ridge on the back, comes across my property onto that said property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| and there is a pond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| And my concern is when they do something with that property developing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| is it going to pond water up on me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1393)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| So you're concerned about the runoff from the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| The runoff from the ridge back behind comes across mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| onto that property, which there is a pond on that property that Mr. Harbin is talking about there that feeds that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1414)|
| 0:23:43| What's he going to do with that water that's going to be feeding that pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| I don't want it ponded up on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Mr. Harbin, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| What Mr. Smith is concerned about, there's an existing pond right there, and they've got it circled right there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| He just wants to make sure that we don't raise the berm or make that pond any higher than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| If we did at that point, it would inundate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| As the water came down there, it could come back and flood onto his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| I can assure you that's not in our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| And, in fact, we're doing environmental work right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| And if that comes back favorable, we'll be removing that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| At the very worst, it will just remain in its present state without any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| In its present state, water does not back up onto his property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| So we won't have any effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| This subdivision won't have any effect on the overall hydrology of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| I have a question for you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| The concept plan shows that pond to be filled, and actually the new detention pond to be on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| is that still your plans if the environmental report comes back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Yes, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| And our environmental report did come back favorable in our environmentalist opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| so that's been sent off to TDEC now for verification and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Once TDEC approves that, then we'll be able to remove that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| And that will accommodate the drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| One other thing, I'll probably have to ask David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| is there going to be a swell or tile or what for the water to run off of my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Yes, that's the next step after we get the concept approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| We'll be preparing the design plans through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| And, yes, we will make allowances for either a pipe or a swell to bring that water through our property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| Because there is a great amount of water that flows down through there that fills that pond completely up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1550)|
| 0:26:01| There was a man from the state out there that looked at it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| Michael Swaggerty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| But if the water can be taken care of and not backed up on me, I have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| And it sounds like there is plans to do that mitigation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Conditions 5, 6, and 7 actually would address all these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| The pond actually has a designated wetland on it, so they have to deal with both TDEC and the Corps on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| And it's subject to their approval for basically elimination of that pond or any mitigation that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| And also the new stormwater location may require some off-site easement for discharge from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| All these will be dealt with through the design plan stage with county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| And if there's some problems that they're not able to eliminate or modify the pond, then they would have to get a revision back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| That's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I was going to say conditions 5, 6, and 7, Mr. Smith, all address your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| And I think if you want to go on our website and look at those, that gives you some pretty good protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| because it's state-mandated what he's having to do to take care of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| With that, I'd like to make a motion that we approve variance 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| because the site conditions restrict compliance with subdivision regs and the proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Crowder to approve variance 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| Don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Motion to approve the concept plan subject to the nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Motion to approve the development plan for up to 31 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet, subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| Next item on the agenda is item number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| This is a rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| The applicant is Benjamin C. Mullins, Cadenza LTD LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| The location is the northeast corner of intersection of Shod Road and Johnson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| The tract information is 2.69 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| The proposed plan designation and zoning is N.C. Neighborhood Commercial, A. Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| The proposed plan designation and zoning is G.C. General Commercial and P.C. Planned Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| The existing land use is rural residential, and the proposed use is a BMW and MINI service and repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1774)|
| 0:29:45| Our recommendation is to deny the sector plan amendment to G.C. General Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| also to deny the request for P.C. Planned Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Do you want to go first, sir, or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I'll hear the opposition first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| He has the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1806)|
| 0:30:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1834)|
| 0:30:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Connie West, 3222 Johnson Road, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| Can I have pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| Mr. Breschko here at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1863)|
| 0:31:13| The property is in a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| It is a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| The four-lane goes nowhere, and since it's been the four-lane, we can't get out of our driveway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1879)|
| 0:31:28| I brought pictures that show it is a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| The property backs right up next to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Our driveways are just almost touching each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| The land is on an underground water table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| There's no red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| We have traffic jams all the time, and rain runoff from the field behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| floods the land next door to us all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| It's standing in water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| There's no sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Thank you, Ms. West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| You may want to stay close because some commissioners may have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1933)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Benjamin Mullins, French McCollum Seymour, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| I appreciate Ms. West coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| This is the first opposition we had heard to this development from any of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| and I would point out that the existing sector plan is a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| which does call for there to be commercial development at this intersection of Shod Road and Johnson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| The concept of this property being developed as commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| is something that is contemplated by the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| The issue that we have, and my clients and I have met with the planning staff multiple times on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1981)|
| 0:33:10| talking through this issue, and I do appreciate where they are coming from on their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| and I hope I have set forth a plan that would alleviate those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| and would make this something that the planning commission would consider approving today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| This property, with the sector plan being a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| that sector plan only currently calls for a commercial neighborhood zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2013)|
| 0:33:43| I've had conversations with Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| It seems that the intent of that sector plan would also accommodate a PC zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| but it does not specifically do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| The PC zoning, as commissioners know, is a very robust way of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2033)|
| 0:34:02| that whatever development goes on to that property is properly planned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| With all the concerns that Ms. West had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| it would be something that we would work through on the planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| There would have to be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| There would have to be conditions put in place to deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| So I understand her concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| and we are asking for a zone that would allow us to specifically address those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| and allow this commission to specifically address those concerns in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| So that's something that we will continue to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| and we've got to work with her specifically as to what her concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| now that we know there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| I sent a letter out on Tuesday, which I hope everyone in the commission has received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| I don't want to repeat it too much, but in short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| the recommendation to deny the rezoning did contain a note that if you do consider the PC zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| that you limit it to the landscaping that's in the CN zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| And when that recommendation first came out, I asked for this to be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| and I went and met with planning staff again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| and we talked about even potentially restricting that further by conditioning the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| and sector plan to only this particular use that would be allowed in a PC zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| and the uses that are currently allowed in the CN zone, which we are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| We have an option to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| My client is currently leasing property on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| It's a very high-end type commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| The setbacks for a PC zone are a peripheral of 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Our use could fit within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| There are very few commercial uses that can fit within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| so that would further insulate there being concerns for future commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| At the agenda review, Ms. Albertson also mentioned concerns about the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| which is some of the concerns that Ms. West raised as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| This is on the intersection of Shod Road, which is an arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| I understand Johnson Road is very narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| but there are currently two curb cuts onto Shod Road at that location right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| and again, the neighborhood commercial and the CN zone is designed to be at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| of communities like this and neighborhoods like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So we believe it's a good development, a good use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| My client chose this property in particular because this is the heart of where his clientele comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| And so it certainly has an interest in attempting to do a good development medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| with the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| So we're willing to very limit the uses that will be going down on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| to condition the rezoning very specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| And with respect to staff's recommendation, we ask that you do approve the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| and the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| This is not going to cause there to be further creep of commercial further down Johnson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| because it won't support it, but it would support it at the intersection of Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| which is why the current sector plan calls for a neighborhood commercial at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| I'm here for any questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Ms. Albertson, I know we did discuss this at agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| and Mr. Mullins suggested that should we amend the sector plan that there could be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2246)|
| 0:37:36| for the specific use put on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| Can you talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I'll try to clarify unless Gerald wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| It's my understanding that the commission can choose to approve a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| but not approve the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| And also while we can place conditions addressing physical design aspects of a development of a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2277)|
| 0:38:06| limiting uses beyond those limited by the zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| or permitting uses not permitted by the zoning designation is frowned upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| It's kind of my understanding from what we've talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| One quick point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| the condition that staff recommended if you were to approve planned commercial would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| that the neighborhood commercial landscaping standards be conditioned as part of any approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| And as a design related, that is an appropriate condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Okay. Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Even if this came in at neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I went out and I pass that site quite often and am familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| Even if neighborhood commercial was being sought after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| I would really have to see a good plan and some kind of use that would be more neighborhood friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2342)|
| 0:39:12| a cleaner, a drug store, something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| An auto repair, especially based on some of the auto repair places that we've seen as of late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| as they're developing, they're fairly large buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| You have lifts for cars and big garage doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| and cars parked outside when they are waiting to be serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| I just don't think this area is a good fit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Like I said, I'd have to, even if it was neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I'd have to look and make sure for me to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| It'd have to be something a little bit less than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| So I'm going to make a motion that we deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| However, we still have a light on. Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I was going to echo what Mr. Clancy said, that Steve Maddox brought in a fairly comprehensive master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| of what I would feel in this area would be a good commercial node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| which is at the corner of Oak Ridge Highway down the street from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| And he's got several out parcels, and yeah, there it is, probably a couple miles away maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| Less than a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Right. And he's got an internal road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| He's got 10 out parcels, and I think this fit would be more appropriate on his property, not mid-block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2432)|
| 0:40:41| So I would be with Mr. Clancy and, I guess, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| We do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| to deny the sector plan amendment to GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Motion to deny the request for PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to deny the request for PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=2480)|

| 0:51:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3086)|

| 0:51:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3088)|

| 0:51:49| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| I have a question for the benefit of the commission and maybe I should know this, but what's the difference between MUSD NC12 and MUSD NC13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3111)|
| 0:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I was going to ask that very same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Michelle, could you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| MUSD NC12 allows medium density residential, low density residential only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| The recommended zoning classifications are R1, R1A, and RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| MUSD NC13 allows industrial, commercial, office, and low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| The recommended zoning is O1, C1, and I2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Just as a comment from the director, first of all, we will be revising our land use classification tables with the hope for adoption of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3151)|
| 0:52:43| Just as an observation, having a mixed use designation that only allows residential seems contradictory, and we'll try to clear up those contradictions and make the whole land use classification system a bit more simple and understandable as we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3163)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3180)|

| 0:57:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3440)|

| 0:57:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Now we're on to agenda item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| This, again, is, we've got two reports on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| One is the plan amendment report, and the other is a plan amendment, one-year plan amendment and rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3461)|
| 0:57:49| So I'm going to read both of them into the record before discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Applicant is TM3 Properties, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3474)|

| 0:58:32| Staff recommendation is to deny GC General Commercial sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3512)|

| 0:59:22| Staff recommendation is to deny GC General Commercial one-year plan designation for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| Also to deny the rezoning of C-6 General Commercial Park consistent with the denial recommendations for the associated plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Sir, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Todd Miller, 109 South North Shore Drive, suite 401-37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| We would like to request to postpone this for 30 days until the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| The opposition and I are still meeting and talking about our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| and trying to have an agreement to put before you all before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| And, sir, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| When I saw the name of the agenda item, I did receive your email yesterday requesting postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| And I just didn't recognize when you said agenda item 40, but the name, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| My name is Bill Hendon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| I live at 9620 Leavens Way in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| Mr. Hendon, did you write down your name on the sheet there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| I didn't know whether you made what order to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Anyway, I'm here for the president of our homeowners association, Tim Stewart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| who I think sent you an email in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| We do not have a problem with continuing this to listen to what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| So we're not in opposition to the continuance, but we remain in opposition to the rezoning as it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3655)|
| 1:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Why don't you go ahead and write down your name and address while commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| I think that he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3679)|
| 1:01:27| All three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| So all three items will be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| Do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3699)|
| 1:01:58| And sometimes I help my assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3718)|
| 1:02:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Next on the agenda, which was removed from consent list is item number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| The applicant is Crescent Bend Development LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| The location is the east side of Ebenezer Road, south of Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Approximate size of the tract is 4.98 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| The zoning is PC planned commercial and PR planned residential and F floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3754)|
| 1:02:42| The existing land use is a former nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| The proposed use is a commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| The staff recommendation is to approve the development plan for a commercial building with a drive-through window and approximately 12,800 square feet of building area subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3769)|
| 1:03:02| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3786)|
| 1:03:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore, Drive Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3821)|
| 1:03:49| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Crescent Bend Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| We're here on a use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| We've met with MPC professional staff on multiple occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| and Billy Fulgham, the engineer for the applicant, has met with engineering and professional staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| We did all that pre-submittal to the actual submitting of the application, conducted a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| As you'll notice in the use-on review report, there is a staff recommendation with what's 10 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| as I referenced in my letter from yesterday, but now it is 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| We point out that this development is the appropriate development and appropriate use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| As the staff report noted, there will be minimal impact on the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| It meets the requirements of the planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| It's consistent with the general standards for use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| It's consistent with the general plan and sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| and the proposed use is in harmony with the intent and general purpose of the planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| Again, the applicant agrees with the 12 conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| and would request that the commissioners approve the use-on review request subject to the 12 conditions as noted in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3900)|
| 1:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| If I may reserve the rest of my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| I apologize, Taylor, for making you all wait another hour or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| My biggest concern is the entrance there on Ebenezer closest to Westland, and especially the left turn lane out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3919)|
| 1:05:31| I'd be comfortable with a left turn in, right turn out, I mean right turn in, right turn out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3931)|
| 1:05:39| but cutting across four lanes of traffic at that location I think is problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| and I think the question we have to ask is, you know, the vested rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| and I think we discussed that previously in that, you know, I think vested rights are pretty much at this point out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3949)|
| 1:05:58| This has been over seven years since it was initially approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| I think vested rights go up to three years and then an additional two years if there's been some activity on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| but there has not been any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| You know, I understand why this was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| but I think in the best interest of the community that we have a right in, right out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| and eliminate the left turn out at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| So when we initially started meeting on the pre-submittal of the application with professional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| it was indicated that they would support a right in, right out, and we were agreeable to a right in, right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| The problem was that the use on review concept plan that was approved in 2012 for the Weigel site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=3998)|
| 1:06:46| we only have an access easement to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| and so the use on review concept plan that was approved in 2012 has the three lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| the right in, right out, and the left turn out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| and so the only way that we can get away from having to construct it as previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| is to get Weigel's to agree to amend their concept plan, which we've tried and they will not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| As far as the vested rights, under the Tennessee state statute, the Vested Rights Act of 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| there are time limits that were defined under the Vested Rights Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| and for a preliminary development plan, final development plan, concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| however the local municipality wants to refer to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| it is three years when commencement of construction must start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| However, under the enabling clause by the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| the Tennessee Constitution gives local municipalities broad authority to create their own ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| to create their own legislative actions and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| And they grant them the broad authority to regulate and police those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| The only time that the state law will trump a local ordinance is if it is more restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| than what is enumerated under the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| So in this scenario, saying Weigel's use on review had expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4089)|
| 1:08:20| saying that Weigel's use on review had not expired is not more restrictive of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| The local municipality can grant leniency or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| What the local municipality couldn't do, if the state law says you've got three years vested rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| Knox County or Knoxville couldn't create an ordinance that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| No, we're only going to give you two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| That would be abuse of their policing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| However, the local municipality could say, We give you four years of vested rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| and that would be acceptable under the enabling clause of the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| So what we have right here is we weren't necessarily seeking this three-lane in and out from the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4136)|
| 1:09:05| We had created the right in, right out, and then it was noted to us that we had to proceed accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| based on the previously approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| And so we can't get Weigel's to agree to amend this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| and arguably my client, who has this access easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| obviously probably has some vested rights theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| Weigel still has vested rights under this previously approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Mr. Breschke, I'm going to call on you in just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Ma'am, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| I just came here to observe, but I live in the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Ma'am, could you give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| My name is Marie McGuigan, and I live at 1313 Farrington Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| which is part of Farrington subdivision, which backs up to the apartment, which have been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4199)|
| 1:10:09| and also to this area, which would have the shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I just want to preface this by saying in 2012 and 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| we as a community spent unbelievable time here with the Weigel's Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4220)|
| 1:10:28| until those concessions were granted to have the Weigel's property have safe egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4228)|
| 1:10:37| and ingress from Westland and from Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| One of the key points, as you pointed out, was having egress be a right and a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4242)|
| 1:10:51| I believe there was a traffic study done in conjunction with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| Is that so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Just as a traffic study was done for the building of the apartments behind before that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| But I don't know if any of you drive down Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| We have two schools which empty into that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| and the traffic that I can't even get out of my subdivision onto Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| and make a left-hand turn at business times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| You go during the early afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| I don't know if you're still considering putting a right and a left out of that Weigel's entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| but to me it's a very dangerous thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| My other question is I thought in reading the planning that ingress and egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4309)|
| 1:11:58| would be through the more southern entrance on Ebenezer, not through a Weigel's entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4318)|
| 1:12:08| I did not believe that the Weigel's entrance was even part of this plan initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| and I may be very incorrect on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| But that's what I came here thinking after reading what was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| I'm going to ask Mr. Breschke to help clarify some of these points, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| I'm glad you think I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| The Weigel's store was approved back in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| At that time there was a traffic impact study that was submitted as a part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| Following that time I believe the county had made some major intersection improvements at Westland, at Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4364)|
| 1:12:51| and a lot of those things were addressed in that previous traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| At that time we were only dealing with the Weigel's parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| It did not include this piece of property that's before you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| and they had two access points approved, the one on Westland and the one on Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| and those locations that are shown on the plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| Under that previous plan there's a little difference between that approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| and the one that's before you now is that the piece that comes off of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| was directed more into the Weigel's parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| and the driveway that would go over to this commercial center actually teed into that driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| So it was more directed to the Weigel's property and not to this commercial center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| And the location that's on Ebenezer, what's shown there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| is in the location that was shown on the previous approval for Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| The subdivision regulations and some other ordinances and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| specify that there's a time limit on an approval that you have to get to the next stage in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| It's been two years to come in with a design plan approval and move to a final plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| or you can ask for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Some of our other boards have similar type restrictions on time of an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| The use and review is silent on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| So what we have done in the past is if somebody has come in and received an approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| if they come in in the next year or two and move forward with a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| or they may come in ten years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| as long as they have come in with the same development approval that they had previously without changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| we actually allow them to go forward through the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| So it's been silent on that, so we have not had the issue before about there's an expiration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| When they came in with this plan and met with engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| they had identified the preference that that access to Ebenezer be a write-in, write-out only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| In our discussions and meeting with the applicant, we told them that with the plans that they were showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| they had that extension along the top of the drawing going into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| That was different internally from the Weigel's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| and so was the location of the Ebenezer access that was now shown as write-in, write-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| They would need to get Weigel's to agree to making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| because those improvements are on the Weigel's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| and it would be a change from what they had as a previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Or the other option they had was to follow the plan that was approved by Weigel's on the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| and utilize those access points as they were originally designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| The Weigel's approval also had conditions that they had to allow this connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| between their driveway entrances and this commercial property that's before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| One was that driveway along the top of the drawing there, and the other one was the Ebenezer access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| although there wasn't a connection shown to the shopping center parcel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| They had to allow a connection along that southern entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| So this is reflecting those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| We talked with engineering about the issue of going from a write-in, write-out to full access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| I think it's going to be best for them to address that issue and their position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| The recommendation that you have in your packet was based on discussions I had with county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| on conditions to try to make some of the adjustments to the plan that is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| to be in line with the previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| We were recommending that approval based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| I think any time we start talking about write-in, write-out restrictions on driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| I often hear, and this was brought up when we dealt with the Graham development the past month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| that people don't follow those restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| The less of a restriction you have on entering into it, I think the more problems you may have on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| When you're crossing two to three lanes of traffic, people going southbound in Ebenezer to turn into this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4622)|
| 1:17:11| make a left turn, you have this small little entrance that you're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| and I bet the majority of people that are going to try to make that turn are going to be going in the exiting lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| on the right lane, because there's not a median to keep that turning movement from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| The traffic impact analysis that was done for this development and for the previous one for the apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| the main entrance that they have that's on the right side of that drawing that serves the apartment development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| one of the issues that was raised there is left turns coming out of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| People are actually trying to make that left turn and go all the way to the extreme right lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| because a lot of them would be trying to get in that right lane to turn onto Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| just that short distance down the road from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Actually, one of the benefits, if the traffic allows them to make a left out of this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| is that they would be further from being in that right lane, having to get in the right lane to make the right turn onto Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| So there may be some benefits if traffic movement allows those kind of movements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| There's not a perfect solution, but we're recommending approval of the conditions that were outlined in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Mr. Kamara, do you have anything that you would like to add with regards to county engineering thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| I'm actually in the stormwater department. We have a traffic engineer here the audience may be able to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| Wonderful. Could we get the traffic engineer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4725)|
| 1:18:58| Hello, everyone. Is there any specific questions that I can answer regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| I feel like we've pretty well explained the history and our stance on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| but specifically, does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Could you just give your name and address? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Aaron Fritz, Knox County Engineering, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| What is your opinion on the safety of the lane configuration on Ebenezer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| On Ebenezer, it's going to be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| As Tom was saying, that right in right out with a five lane section actually will be six with that right turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4771)|
| 1:19:40| Will be difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| We would work on that on the design plan phase to really direct that traffic if there were to be a right in right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| That would be our preference. If there was no historical approvals on this site, that is what we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| Okay, so this is a design. This is just a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| But this hasn't come through your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| Are you going to work through the traffic issues for safety and design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| and you might ask for some changes to be made based on meeting your engineering standards for traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| The typical layout of the access point will not change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| but there may be some minor modifications to it once we actually see the detailed design plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| I guess what I'm, you know, if it is unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| my thoughts are that the traffic engineering department is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| that's their purpose once we send this on, to evaluate how this design would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| I mean, I don't know that that's right, but I think that's how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| And if I can add to that, I mean, engineering had been involved heavily with us through this whole review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| They're involved in reviewing the traffic impact studies that we get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| We've had several discussions on this, and, you know, looking at the access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| and the general design of it, they're involved at this stage of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| So if this left turn out, when you guys evaluated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| if you found it to be an unsafe situation, you would not approve it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| I would imagine so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| When that original approval came through, that was a little before my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| but at its original approval, I'm sure it was evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| Yeah, engineering was involved in that review process, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Yeah, we would have been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| So does anyone else have any questions of traffic engineering before we go to the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| Okay, Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| So I do not work for Weigel's anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| I don't have anything to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| You're the one who screwed this up the worst place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| But I'm the one that got this done when I worked for Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| and this was a very, very complicated piece of property at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| There's some nuances to this, but Mr. Weigel and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| actually worked with Mr. Snowden and Ms. Pianchi at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| They had some grant monies that they were working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| some federal grant dollars for intersection improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| and Mr. Weigel actually dedicated all the property on Ebenezer and Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| to allow them to do this free-flow right turn on Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| and the double left on Westland to help the stacking to get closer to the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| and not creep all the way up Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| And that was in conjunction with the approvals for all these access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| and they asked him at the very end to go back and add this joint access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| up on the frontage that they're showing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| This was always intended to be this way, and Mr. Weigel did a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| TDOT was involved. The county was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Everybody knew that this configuration was going to happen at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| in order to get those grant monies spent and get this intersection improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| because it is a very, very majorly congested intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| I would submit, though, that it's in peak periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| It's not all day all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| So I would be in favor of this approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| and I know that Mr. Weigel would not want to get access taken from his convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Mr. Breschke, did you have something else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| I just want to point out the change in the conditions from 10 to 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| we had added two conditions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| One was that, I mean, it's kind of a given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| but two of these access points are on the Weigel's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| and they're going to have to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| although Weigel's was required to allow these access connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| they would need Weigel's approval to be able to make those connections or do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| The second one was pointing out the issue of vested rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| kind of related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| is we've always taken the position that if you do the same plan you were approved for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| you could move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| If you change it, and I'm not sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| They haven't built the store here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| They've gone to different size stores and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| and some of the newer things they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| But if they were to come in with a revised plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| we would be reevaluating these access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| and the revised plan may include only ride-in, ride-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| and may include other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Or if the applicant here or somebody else were to buy this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| to come up with another design plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| we would be looking at this access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| and we basically put them on notice that the plan that's a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| or the access that's a part of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| may change when that corner lot gets redeveloped or gets developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| Tom, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| The retail development currently up for consideration today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| was not planned as part of this access cut, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| I mean, as far as on the Weigel site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| When that came in, it was only for the Weigel store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| The Weigel was coming in with two access points for their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| one on each street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| and that was being evaluated in the traffic study that was done at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| There have been three traffic studies done for this intersection and these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| You have two left-turn lanes from Westland on to Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| and the distance between the entrance to the Weigel's on Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| and the intersection is about 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| I just think it's too close and too many turning movements in a short distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| And it may be something, again, that if the Weigel's does not develop their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| if they were to sell it to this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| and they were to come in to do an extension of the shopping center at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| at that point, it may be that we would be recommending that this access point be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| I mean, it will be reevaluated when any development comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| that's a change from what had already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| And I think something that's come to mind in discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| was on this whole vested rights issue about the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| since this has been approved at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| the county has not addressed the vested rights in their ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| but the county could take a position that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| we were going to look at approvals that we've had out there on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| to determine whether they still have a vested right to take a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| Actually, I'm taking the prerogative of being the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| Staff will evaluate our procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| You know, this project is an example of one that the Weigel's project was approved seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5217)|
| 1:27:07| Conditions have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| Does that plan still work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| My statement, my feeling is, at best, a plan approved 12 years ago needs to be reevaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| To extend vested rights indefinitely does no one any good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| not the developer, not the community, and certainly not this planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| when you get the blame for approving a project being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| that has to deal with today's conditions based on a design that was approved 12, 7, 25 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5251)|
| 1:27:41| We will reevaluate that and come to you with a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| likely that vested rights on projects are aligned with the state statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| and vested rights run as a state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| It doesn't deal with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| It's past this one, but for future projects, when they're approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| they have a certain amount of time to start construction or they have to be reevaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| I'll bring that to you for your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| I did have one other question, and I know that there's other commissioners that have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| With regards to county engineering, when you are looking at these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| and you determine if it is determined that this is an unsafe entrance exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5308)|
| 1:28:38| does that then also translate to the Weigels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| I know this is kind of complicated, but does that then translate to the Weigels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5323)|
| 1:28:53| Because I understand that this is Weigels property, and they say, well, this is the way it's got to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| but if you determine that it is unsafe, does that translate then to the Weigels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| I'm not aware of any decision that our county law department has told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| that we have the ability to go back on anything that we've previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| and essentially take that away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| I'm not aware of that. That doesn't mean that that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| But I would think since we gave somebody the thumbs up on something, we can't go back and take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| That's a little bit outside of my transportation and traffic purview, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| But you said when you're reviewing this design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| you may make the decision that it creates unsafe conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| This specific design? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| If we were to have a decision today, right now, we would prefer that to be a right in, right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5389)|
| 1:29:57| But as they've said, they don't really have that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| because they're operating on someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| They're constructing both of these entrances on someone else's property under a previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| Makes it tough. Commissioner, thank you. Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| I was interested to hear what Commissioner Uten had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| I knew he could shed some light on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I don't disagree with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| I don't think it's an ideal situation left out on this particular entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5423)|
| 1:30:32| And I agree with Director Green that we probably ought to limit the time that it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| I don't think anybody wins when you let it just go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| But seven years ago, this intersection was horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| It was one of the biggest traffic problems in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| And the work that was done, and the Wiggles Corporation gave a lot of time and land and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5455)|
| 1:31:04| to make this intersection safe right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| The fact that they haven't built their building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| we're just getting the benefit of that right now without having to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| But the question right now is the commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| The fact that in 2012 we did a right out, left out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5481)|
| 1:31:30| We knew it was going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Yeah, it might be more traffic, and it may be not as safe as I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| But I think we've got to, we asked the property owners for certain concessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5497)|
| 1:31:45| and we approved this based on those concessions in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| It's a better intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| It's not perfect, but it's a better intersection at Westland and Ebenezer now than it ever would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| if we had not gone through that process with the Wiggles Corporation and gotten all that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| I think there was a benefit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| And to take that away from either of these two developers I think is probably not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan for a commercial building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| with a drive-through window and approximately 12,800 square feet of building area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| subject to the 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| To approve the development plan, we do still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| I'd first like to say I do not work for Wiggles either, but I do shop with them pretty often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| Well, I mean, I don't either, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| And I think Wiggles does a pretty good job, and they do such a good job they generate a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| And I drive this intersection probably several times a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| and I have to agree with Commissioner Phillips that this could be a very dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| There are two schools close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| There's a lot of pedestrian traffic that will be going through here besides vehicle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| And I think we need to take another look at the design of the entrance and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Commissioner Ruff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| I'm hearing a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| This thing was approved before, and I don't know that we as a board have come up with a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5613)|
| 1:33:42| or justifiable reason to change that without input from traffic engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| And I think we deal with this through, let's see, item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5626)|
| 1:33:54| It says meet all applicable requirements of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| I think if this goes through engineering again and they decide it's not safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| and they decide they change it, then that's where that needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| I don't necessarily think we should change it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| But that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| And, you know, with this requirement, I think approving this thing is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5656)|
| 1:34:27| Commissioner Hill, you did have your light on, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Yes, I think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| At one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| We currently have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Uten to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5681)|
| 1:34:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| I think we have three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Who were the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| Myself, Pat, and Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| And we are now on to agenda item 50 that was pulled off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5719)|
| 1:35:30| This is church and associated community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5730)|
| 1:35:41| It's not written in a way that I'm normally used to seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| I don't get a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| That's one of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Yes, Amy, could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| This is a request for a similar use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| The reason that I requested that it be pulled off consent is to make sure that the applicant who had called me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| if he did end up showing up, that he had an opportunity to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| But it looks like he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| And is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| Is there opposition to this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| The staff recommendation is to recommend the planning commission deny the request to allow churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| and associated community uses due to the incompatibility of such community uses with uses intended in an industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5785)|
| 1:36:38| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| I think staff has this exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| I think that industrial districts were created to have land uses like manufacturing and those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5802)|
| 1:36:51| and churches don't really fit in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| So I'd like to make a motion that the planning commission deny the request to allow churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| and associated community uses due to that incompatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| to follow staff recommendation to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| I do not see any lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Just one quick thing that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| No, I'll write too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| I'll send a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| No, this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Well, you didn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Well, some of you may think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| We're working on getting tablets for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| Those will be provided to you at agenda review and picked up following this meeting so that our staff can update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5857)|
| 1:37:45| No, you took them home and you screwed with them, and so they didn't work when you brought them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| You are on microphone and recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| That means you took your screwdriver and you adjusted the tablets on your own instead of letting us do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| But we will have those for you over the next coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Again, you'll receive them at agenda review, and they'll be picked up following this meeting so that our staff can update them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| and put all the information on them for the next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| Okay, so you want the one that I have in the bottom of my file drawer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Are we getting new ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| But we'll still get paper, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| We'll still get paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Why do you need paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Could you use a computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Scott will get paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Scott will get paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190711?start=5909)|
