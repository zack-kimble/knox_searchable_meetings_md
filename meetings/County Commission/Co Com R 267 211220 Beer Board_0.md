| 0:24:13| Sir, do you work for Casey's or are you a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| I work for Casey's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| I'm a district supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| We're all familiar with pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Just what's the difference between a pilot convenience store and what Casey's is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I know we're all famous pizza sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Can you just give me a little bit of what we expect at Casey's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Casey's is going to be a lot like pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| We're people-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| We're going to focus on our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1476)|

| 0:24:42| You know, Casey's is still going to be a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| We're still going to take care of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| and maybe not to the level that Mr. Haslam and Pilot has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| but we're still going to be a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Commissioner Hill, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| I noticed on this application that it has a different property owner name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1504)|
| 0:25:15| yet the attachment for the officers is for the CGS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1515)|
| 0:25:23| but this one is listed as HGC with a different address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| From my understanding, it's all Casey's, and it's a good stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| It's just a different branded Casey's General Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| So, like, we have the Pilot Travel Centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| which is kind of a separate entity from the pilot convenience stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| It's probably the best way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| But it's still all under the same umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| But you actually physically own the property of Good Stop also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1553)|
| 0:26:03| I think Pilot owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| Could you come to the podium, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Can we have your name and address for the record, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Dan Fleming, 4703 Temachi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| I'm the vice president of Pilot, and I'm in charge of selling the stores to Casey's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| And the ownership, land ownership, is under the Haslam's many other ventures and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| but Casey's is leasing the property to run the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and they purchase the business from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| So are they going to be making lease payments to the Haslam for that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| As a matter of fact, when I ran the stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I had to make a lease payment to the Haslam family too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Yeah, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| I just noticed the discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| No, that's good that you picked that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Thank you, Mr. Fleming, for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Commissioner Bussle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| So, Mr. Fleming, all the properties that we're talking about here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| Casey's or whatever they're doing right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| the property is still owned by the Haslam Pilot Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| and they're just leasing the property from you all, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| There's 40 properties, and some are and some aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| Some of them, they're buying the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| It depends on how the lease went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| and it's just the difference of how our corporation saw buying land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| previously and establishing the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Sometimes it was better for us to buy the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| and lease the property basically to themselves or to our corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| and us pay a lease off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| I don't want to get into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| but just to diversify their holdings and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Everybody knows the age of Mr. Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| And the reason why I ask that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| you said this property was being leased back to the Casey's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| and there's two others that was in here that they said they were buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| It was 241, which is John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| They're buying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| By the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| 123 Clinton Highway, they are buying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| The Middlebrook Pike, I call it 193,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| Joe Hinton and that, that is a leased property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| that they are buying the lease from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| But they'll still be paying a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| which there are several leases and conglomerations in the 63 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| that Mr. Haslam had the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-l-247-211220-beer-board?start=1746)|
