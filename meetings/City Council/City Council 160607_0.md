| 0:08:13| to come down and make that presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| and also to introduce us to our new PARC Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Mr. Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you, Council, and greetings to Deputy Chief Ken Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| who's going to be participating in the promotion ceremony, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| on June 15 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| So congratulations to him and his promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Again, my name is Steve Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| I'm the current Chairman of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| I've been with the committee five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| and it has been a true pleasure to serve the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I'd like to thank Avis Reed and Lisa Chambers for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| They've done a fantastic job in keeping things running and well willed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| I'll take this opportunity now to introduce our new Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Clarence Vaughn III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Clarence, stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| I was honored to be a part of the selection committee for Clarence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| and we had, I believe, Avis, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| eight applicants for the position, and they were all just top-notch people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| It was a tough decision, but Clarence stood out above the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| and I feel we have a fantastic new Executive Director for PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Again, it was an honor to be a part of the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| I understand we also have a new member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I have yet to meet him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| The individual's name is Jared Croom, spelled C-R-O-O-M-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| I haven't read his biography yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| That's Jared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| I haven't met you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I'm going to shake his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| So, again, I haven't read his bio yet, and I'm anxious to read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| and see who we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| He looks pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| We also have two current positions on PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| and I understand the mayor is currently looking at filling those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| So, again, I'm here to present the 2015 Annual Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| And, as you know, our previous director, Avis Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| and Lisa Chambers continued to serve in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| and improve the relationship between the city of Knoxville and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| Despite the rising turmoil we must acknowledge in other cities throughout the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| the decreasing case numbers, not vastly decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| but there were decreasing case numbers in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| suggests that the Knoxville community has faith in PARC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| and the complaints against the Knoxville Police Department are being addressed fairly and comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| The previous director, Avis Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| continued her service with the Knoxville Police Department Training Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| and served by participating in recruit and in-service training classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| And she did something that was pretty novel that I thought in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| She gathered all the committee members for a full one-day training class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| at the Field Creek Training Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| and there were a lot of presentations all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| and we had great turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| I think every PARC committee member was there and devoted a full day to this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| But it also served to educate both the PARC committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| on how police operations are conducted in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| So this focus on training has been very beneficial to PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| And the executive director continued to meet with the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| As you can see, we stayed very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| And, again, it's been a great opportunity to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| and I think we're providing a great service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Before I close, a couple of shout-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Robbie Arrington, one of the vice chairmen of the PARC committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| did a great job fulfilling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| I was absent for a couple of meetings due to some health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| but I wanted to give him a shout-out and thank him for his help in filling in for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| again on short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| And one of the Knoxville Police Department staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| a gal named Debbie Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| she is doing a fantastic job in putting a lot of work into the IAU cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Actually doing transcripts, which I know from my FBI days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| are very, very difficult and time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| But it gives the PARC members a real taste for what's transpiring on these cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| as individuals are being interviewed, both the police officers and the complainants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| And, like I said, the packages, the IAU cases presented to PARC are very, very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| And, like I said, I think a shout-out needs to go to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| She's done a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| And, lastly, I'll just say the next PARC meeting is slated for July 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| I don't think we have a venue yet at the Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| So, again, City Council, members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| we'd invite as much participation as we could possibly get to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| It will take place at 6 p.m. to get on July 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| And that concludes the PARC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Yeah, if I could ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Looking at page 7 of the report, two things stand out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| One was harassment, and I was just wondering if you had any comments on the nature of that complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| or set of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| I guess it shows eight incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| The other one was rudeness, and I don't know whether that had 13 incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| And I don't know whether they actually wrote the ticket you didn't want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| or what the rudeness was, but I'd like to hear about those two, the harassment and the rudeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Well, as you can see, these are pretty common complaints on the part of citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| And what I'll speak to that is each and every complainant that comes before the IAU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| and most of them come through the IAU to us as opposed to directly through PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| but each and every one is addressed thoroughly to make sure it's resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| In a lot of these, thankfully there's audio recording, and a lot of times there's video recordings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| And I'll say the vast majority of these are refuted as the audio is reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| And we have an audio review committee that makes sure that the police are doing their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| in making sure their interactions with the citizenry is recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| And that provides just fantastic evidence as to what actually transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And upon review of those, I can say the vast majority are resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| and the information is presented back to the complainant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Resolved in the sense that there was no harassment, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| or that they have corrected the problem somehow or other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| I'm comfortable in saying the vast majority of cases are resolved through those audio recordings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| where if you go back and listen, what is said on those audio recordings do not correspond with the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=876)|
| 0:14:45| So this is the event right at the car, right near where the car is and the complainant is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Deputy Miller, could you speak to the audio recordings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| They're both in car and on the body of the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Yes, the recording is they have an in-car component and they have a built-mic component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| And the built-mic obviously stays with the officer as he leaves the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and, of course, obviously when a prisoner is in the car, the interior mic can record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So those are the two mic recordings that he would be referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| But it's the same video, just two different ways to record a conversation or interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| And I guess the chairman was saying that when you look or listen to the videos or the recordings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| you get the sense that the complaint is not well founded in at least some of those cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| I would say a majority of the cases it is unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Now, there have been some disciplinary actions where some officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| some of the allegations have been sustained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| and appropriate disciplinary action is taken on the part by the chief toward those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| And the same holds true for rudeness and courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| And as you can understand, those are the vast majority of complaints against officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| All right, well, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I wanted to ask you how your attendance has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| I know you're moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| The next one is at the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| But how has your attendance been at the park meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| You know, it hasn't been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I mean, some meetings will have pretty good attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| And I think we've had hour-and-a-half meetings, you know, where we're engaging the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| And, in fact, we said, okay, we have to limit the citizens' time to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| because we're going an hour-and-a-half, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| approaching two hours on one of the recent meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| So we're asking them to limit to five meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| And if we can't resolve it amongst ourselves as a committee, we'll ask the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| to do this on their own initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| They'll speak with the individual that brought something forward, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| after the meeting and address it individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| And we'll follow up and make sure that it was done to their satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| But it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| And that's why, you know, we make these efforts to get out into the community and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| hey, please, please attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Come and see what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| And feel free to bring your issues, you know, before a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| But it has been cyclic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| I mean, we've had big attendance and we've had minimal attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Nott, thank you very much for being here and your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| That concludes the mayor's report and reports of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Councilman Del Voco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Yeah, I don't have a report, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| but I want to ask, I guess, the deputy mayors or folks that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| if we can find some way to do some good advertisement of that business breakfast you described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| that's coming up on June the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| I mean, I think we have heard issues in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Are we getting enough women contractors, black contractors, minorities of other flavors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| I think we ought to take an ad to the radio stations that are pertinent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| or in appropriate newspapers that are, you know, have that circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| It's obviously a great opportunity for them to learn about their business opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| And, unfortunately, a lot of people don't take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| But I think we should go out of our way to advertise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| Well, we actually have been, and I can bring Jesse or Eric down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| I was looking for Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| I don't think Boyce Evans is here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| But Boyce has been working along with Pam Cotham, the assistant purchasing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| And they have been working very hard to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| They've been on radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| It's been in the newspaper several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| And they've also been on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| So we're trying really hard to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| But you're right, we do want as many people to be there as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| In fact, this year we are glad that KUB will be joining us as well in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| So they will be there to talk about what opportunities they may have for these types of contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| But, Jesse, anything else that I'm missing there that we did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Well, just that we did sort of our normal round of press release and social media and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| And Boyce did a lot of interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| But then we actually took a second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| We put out a second press release specifically focusing on Pam Cotham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| and her efforts targeted at attracting DBEs, disadvantaged business enterprises, to come to the business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| And she's doing a second round of media appearing on local TV, radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| So we're kind of doing everything we can to kind of blitz the local media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| In terms of advertising specifically, I mean, we don't really have a budget to take out ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| But we get really good cooperation from the media in terms of promoting these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| And anything you all can do, obviously, through all of your own associations to promote that would be great as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| Does Boyce have some kind of list of contractors that he can send a postcard out to or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Then that's all happened, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| The other thing that Pamela did is she had a great idea to try to reach out to a lot of the local churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| and ask that it be put into their bulletins that we were providing this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| And we thought that was an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| And so that's gone very well, and we've gotten some good feedback from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Every year that we've had this breakfast, we've had better and better attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| and a lot of us have been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| So I think this year we'll have even greater attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| It's good to hear. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| And not to belabor it, but do we utilize the state's minority vendors list that they offer out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| You know, I don't know. We'll have to ask Boyce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I can ask him tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| It's a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| We'll make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| They're just telling me that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I see Jesse has gone, so I'll ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| That's a Pacific radio station that has a lot of minority listeners, WJBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Have you advertised on that station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| I believe it has been advertised numerous times on JBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Yes, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| It's an important issue that we definitely need to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| because these numbers are very low, and they've been low for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| We need as many DBEs, minorities, small businesses, women-owned businesses to be there as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| because we are going to have a great opportunity for them to talk directly to all of our directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| about the upcoming opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| We'll also have all of our purchasing staff there that can help them understand how to go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| to get registered to do business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| I've got one report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Councilman Wallace joined the mayor and I June 1st last week to kind of cut the ribbon on the new bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1288)|
| 0:21:36| It's over Redbud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| It's a 55-foot bridge connecting into the new 100 acres that was added to the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| at the generosity of the Wood family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| It's 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| It's got five new trails, which, of course, is expanding the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| Among the 100 acres are seven miles of multi-use trails, a bike pump track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| and an adventure playground, which is under construction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| This will make Councilman Della Vopi happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| The project was largely funded by REI grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| For the second year in a row, they've awarded grants to Legacy Park and the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| That bike club does great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Just volunteer work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| It's one of the greatest organizations I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| There's five new trails, and they were funded by a $200,000 recreational trail program grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| from the Tennessee Department of Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| A gentleman was there, and he was just singing the praise of what we've been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| That's a lot of money, tax dollar money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| but they recognize how well that we've put it to use here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| so hopefully there'll be more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| Then on June 17th, next week, three new trails will open at Baker Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| That's at the 100-acre site, which will include a competition-style downhill trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1379)|
| 0:23:08| which is funded by a $100,000 grant from Bell Helmet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| That was awarded to the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| and I'm telling you, it's a double black diamond course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| and you couldn't hold a gun to my head getting me to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I wouldn't walk down it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| But to see them go down it on these bicycles is something that's going to attract a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| It's the only black diamond course on the East Coast, so a lot of good things going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| So with that, any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| CAT will have some proposed trolley route changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| and on the next meeting, June 23rd at 3 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| the public is welcome to come and speak at public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| We're trying to publicize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| So anyone who is interested and who is a bus rider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| that would be June 23rd at 3 p.m. right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| You can come and talk about proposed trolley route changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160607?start=1443)|
