| 0:11:59| Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| My address is 1422 Cornelia Street, Apartment 2, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| Council members, first, I want to thank you from my core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| for your unanimous vote on this plan two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| What a strong show of support for moving our neighborhoods into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| modern era and creating a Knoxville that is freer, fairer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| and more prosperous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| And with one more yes vote, today has the potential to be a watershed day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Today can be the day that we officially begin conquering our housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| I won't belabor you with all the facts of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| as we all know them well at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| We know a new home doesn't have to be affordable for it to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| the overall crisis, because in a simple supply and demand economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| the more we build, the lower and slower rents and home prices grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| We know that homes come in all shapes and sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| and you can build wealth with a fourplex just as much as a detached house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| We know these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Instead, I want to focus on the hope that this plan brings many like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| those who rent and who have called Knoxville home for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| The folks that would most benefit from this plan are those of us under 45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| who are just starting our families and building our careers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| those of us who prefer options for homes in a diverse, dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| and walkable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| We support this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| I am the executive director of a new nonprofit, Yes Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| and in the past months we have both done physical and digital petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Currently we have over 120 signatures by locals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| many of which reside in the TDR areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| These people like me are hopeful because of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| My story is an example why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Two years ago I was living in Forth and Gill in a beautiful historic duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| I loved it and I loved my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| I had planned to stay there until I was able to buy a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| probably around the year 2060,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| but I had a terrible landlord who cared zero for his buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| and even less for his tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Coming back from seeing my family at Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| I discovered that a pipe to the apartment above mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| which was unoccupied, had burst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| My kitchen ceiling and one of my walls had collapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| After emailing my landlord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| reminding him of my rights as a renter under Tennessee state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| as well as his responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| instead of apologizing for the chaos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| he instead told me that he had decided not to renew my monthly lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Due to a random connection and divine timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| I found an apartment in Old North Knoxville that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| while it was more than I had been paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| was still affordable for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Otherwise, I might now be sleeping on a friend's couch or on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| This stressful, degrading insanity that I went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| is directly caused by decades of anti-multifamily home biases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| and fears of neighborhood change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| But we cannot build a city based on bias and fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| We have to build it based on hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| I love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I plan to be here until I die at the young age of 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| I am a KTA commissioner, a local muralist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| and I am involved in the Old North Knoxville board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Like 51% of this city, I am a renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| And like most in that number, I do want to own my own home one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| Like 40% of this city, I am single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| and I do not need or necessarily want to build wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| through a large, detached house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I want options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I want choices to build wealth in a small, attached unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| in a neighborhood I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| This plan is quite literally the least we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| This plan is absolutely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| I want to be able to sleep easy at night, knowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| should another pipe burst and a landlord treat me that badly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| our codes are not preventing new units that match my needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| and preferences from being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| I don't want to rely on a miracle from God to find a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| I should be able to do that on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| And I cannot do that until we officially change our codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| and make today the beginning of the end of this housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Vote yes again, pass this plan, and give us hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Next person signed up to speak is Aaron Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Mr. Jernigan, if you come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| My name is Aaron Jernigan, and I reside at 529 Atlantic Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| which is in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| I moved to Knoxville six years ago to study architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| and have called it home since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| I lived in Lincoln Park for five of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| The draw for me and my wife, who is a teacher at Christenberry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| was the sense of community and connection in the older neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| the welcoming culture, the artsiness, the low cost of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| and the many opportunities that this place offered our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| Some things have changed since then, some for the better, some for the worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| Change always happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| And if you try to avoid change, change will still come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| But the important thing is to decide what is worth preserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And I believe Knoxville's welcoming culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| and close-knit neighborhoods are worth preserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| I'd like to give you three ways that supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| the missing middle housing proposal will help preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| and sustain what is wonderful about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| The first, this proposal will expand the types of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| available for rent and purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Diverse housing serves a diverse population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Is a single-family home really suitable for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| What if someone doesn't want and or can't afford that much house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| or that much property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Should we shut them out entirely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| What if someone would like to live in the same building with other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Perhaps they need help occasionally or they feel more secure that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| What if someone doesn't want all the maintenance associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| with a single-family home on a large lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| but they also don't want to live in a large apartment complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| As we know, it's currently functionally illegal to build new houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| for people with these preferences or constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and tonight there's an opportunity to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| Secondly, this proposal will help stabilize Knoxville's housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| New houses are never cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| and I know this as an architectural designer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Neither are new cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But used cars can't exist without new cars having been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| and likewise, unsubsidized affordable housing can't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| without new housing having been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Aside from that, every new house that attracts a wealthy buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| kept that buyer from outcompeting others for an older house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| and subsequently driving up its price and skewing the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| Finally, this proposal will help expand our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| The missing middle proposal, or the middle housing proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1158)|

| 0:19:28| that I could possibly imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| We know that a healthy tax base over less land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| means more money for sidewalks, bike lanes, greenways, parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| bus service, and recycling pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| Let's treat our city like a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| and re-legalize these types of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| to grow our tax base and support our city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| I appreciate all who have engaged with this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Tonight's an opportunity to make Knoxville a more connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| free, and equitable city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| and to preserve what is most important about our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| the culture of openness and the connection that they breed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this item is Don Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Mr. Lindsey, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| My name is Don Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I reside at 5312 Trace Manor Lane in Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| Thank you all for the work that you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| to hopefully take the missing out of missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I would love to see that happen tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| and would hope that that would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| And thank you as well for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| being a part of AARP's age-friendly community network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| That's an effort of AARP that will, across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| reward and encourage communities and localities across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| to take steps to make sure that people of all ages live well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| and have the good things they need in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| The missing middle genre of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| will give people choices that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| We talked about choices earlier here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| And what it does is allow people, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| who are house-rich and cash-poor to be able to come to an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| and buy into a place that is the right size for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| It's often called downsizing, but really it is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| that allows them to be in the right size of the house that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| It also encourages the kind of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| where they are close to housing, I mean, they're close to stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| employment, they're close to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| recreation, open spaces, and walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| And all of this is desired by a large number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| AARP did a survey not too long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| and determined that there were many, many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| who really preferred that kind of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Missing middle or the middle kind of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| are the kinds of housing that encourage this kind of neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| It will help reduce the isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Remembering COVID, how important we found that isolation could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| to creating a bad situation for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| And this would help discourage isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| by allowing more interaction between people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| And one other thing, too, as we age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| we are going to be in more and more need for caregivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| And unpaid family caregivers are the backbone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| of long-term care in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| And with missing middle, or with the middle type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| that allows more people to be near their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| but still have some space of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| It helps to prevent the kind of thing that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| when people have to spend down all our assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| just to get into Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| But with middle housing, it allows people to be a part of their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| and be close to them, if not right within the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| Middle housing does a lot of great things for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| And I encourage you to continue to vote for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| and be happy to answer any questions if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Thank you, Mr. Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Now we have one person signed up to speak in opposition to Item 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Miss Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I'd like to ask for a minute or two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| since I'm the only one on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| That's council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Yeah, they seem to change a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Deborah Thomas, Oakwood resident, times decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| I don't expect to change anyone's mind tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| but I have a lot more to say about this plan as proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| and what is happening in lower-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| I'm not against missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I'm against the way this plan has been brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Who are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Teachers, librarians, custodians, retail and restaurant workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| nurses, government workers, retirees on fixed Social Security incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| This targeted area is primarily low-income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Many of these neighborhoods are occupied predominantly by people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| These areas include Lonsdale, Mechanicsville, and East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| which will have gentrification with a new stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| They were either redlined or listed as in decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| by the homeowner's loan corporation, Hulk Maps, in the 1930s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| A few of the areas have protections, like 4th and Gill, the mayor's neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| and Old North, member Ryder's neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| which have historic and demolition protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| as well as stable high property prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Others, like Oakwood, are experiencing extreme gentrification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| and continued illegal demolition and unpermitted construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Public comments regarding administrative concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| were not addressed at planning after the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Then the parking requirements were decreased at the second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Administrative concerns were not addressed by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| with the exception of one about matching the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| There is no open and accountable appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| The plan has not been open and inclusive as it was during RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Was there a committee of stakeholders from the impacted areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Nor has there been adequate media coverage presenting both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| There were seven or eight speakers opposed that spoke at the October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| but WAIT-TV only showed an interview of a proponent in Old North, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| There were no cameras at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| The poll showing support was done by the Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| I watched the council workshop and got concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| I attended the meeting at John T. O'Connor Center and wanted more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| The map was small, a regular sheet of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Planning staff can do better than that for a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| that will affect 15,000 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| At the October meeting, I discovered there was essentially a zoning change to RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| I spoke neutrally but expressed concerns about demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| At the December meeting, none of the concerns had been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Parking requirements were eliminated by a last-minute rush of e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| from realtors and investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| There already isn't enough parking in Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| People park in their yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| We also have issues with people not getting their mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| because they must use street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| and if the mailbox is on the street, the post office won't deliver if it's blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| So here's the scenario for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| One of the few unattached lots is at Burwell and Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| If someone builds a fourplex there with no required parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| because it's on the bus line, where will people park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| It's a corner lot with no street parking on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| The neighbors across the street park on their side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| There's maybe one spot in front because it's the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| At council two weeks ago, I expressed concerns over ongoing illegal demolitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| non-permitted construction, parking issues, gentrification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| and lack of regulation at Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| There are only five empty lots not attached to a homeowner nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| in the Oakwood study area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| There are about 700 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I sent you photos of demolished mobile home park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| and the townhouses that have already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| that don't blend in with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| You also saw other demolition pictures in my email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| and nobody mentioned those except to say it wouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| There are differences in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| A few are more stable and have protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Most don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| As a city, we will have a loss of workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Once it's gone, you can't bring it back because new construction is so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| You don't even have an assessment of the available workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| You could postpone a couple of months and do a reassessment of Oakwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| to see what has been lost in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| It's a microcosm of your workforce neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| You say permitting and codes will catch these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| They are already not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| My new neighbor from Chicago says the $300,000 fixer-uppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| There was no permitted work done on his flipped house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| He's doing most of the upgrades himself because he's a carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Even infill design is approving things that don't match with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| like the new townhouses on Oldham Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| As you need to understand, there are differences in codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| for neighbors in Oakwood or Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| If we call codes, it gets neighbors evicted and houses demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| So calling codes doesn't happen often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| only when there are abandoned houses with squatters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| that are robbing or threatening neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Forth and Gill neighbors call all the time to protect their property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| but nothing gets demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| So I guess the next phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| after you unleash the zoning floodgates on low-income residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| will be the flippers coming in and driving out long-term residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| with codes violations they can't afford to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| This has already happened in Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Keep this small. Start with existing empty lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I have asked this at all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| That's 2,000 properties versus 15,000 primarily low-income households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| Have an expiration date and reevaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Focus on the empty corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| United Way owns the old Kmart at Northgate and has for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Fix the parking requirements to one spot per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Alert neighbors they don't have to put mailboxes on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| In closing, I'm not opposed to mixed zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| We already have over 20 duplexes, ADUs, even triplexes in small apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| The conversion does not help low-income neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| If we cannot afford to update our bathroom to age in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| then do you think the neighbors are going to take out a construction loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| to make their home a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| But I'm very opposed to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| There's no guarantee of affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| and a high risk for losing what remains of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| A housing advocate from Nashville said the best thing you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| is keep people where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| If you want to pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| make the initial plan for existing empty lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| and re-evaluate it six months in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Ms. Thomas, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| Council members, that concludes the people who have signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| I just want to say I want to thank council members for all your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| over the many, actually over two years that we've been working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| and getting input from both the Opticos and neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| I want to thank Cheryl Ball, Brian Berry, Amy Brooks, and Lindsay Crockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| for all your work preparing this, refining it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| and having dozens of community meetings both over the many recent months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| and also in just more recent months in working with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| and listening and responding to the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I appreciate all the neighbors who participated and listened and learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| and were open to understanding what maybe seemed like a big change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| but understanding helps people deal with change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and I appreciate people taking the time out of their busy lives to learn about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| I want to thank the UT architecture students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| who did some work to prepare models of what middle housing can look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| and how middle housing very much looks like housing that's already in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| And it will be not only adding to our housing supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| but adding to the beauty and livability of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| that we hope to see these new types of housing added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| Also, just many other groups have been involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Bike Walk Knox, Yes Knoxville, and many other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Just wanted to thank everybody for their input and attention to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| It is a change, but I'm confident that it's going to be a positive one for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| for people of all ages looking for a diversity of housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| based on their needs and their budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| and I think this is a real positive step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Councilmember Parker and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| I was not able to participate in the first discussion on this as I was still snowed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| so I'm glad to be able to participate in discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| I've expressed my concerns as we've been going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| Concerns and frustrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| One being that we've just gone through a recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Four years ago, we'd just gone through a major rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and that set expectations in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| When we've gone through such a massive process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| there's not an expectation that another process will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| But if it is to follow, that at least a similar amount of notice will be given as the first process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:42| We have not given that type of notice or engagement around these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| For the recode process, all impacted property owners received a letter in the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| to let them know about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| We haven't done that with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| We haven't notified folks in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| I remember when I began running for office in 2017, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| the conversations taking place in our neighborhoods were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| we need to preserve our barber homes and our historic homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| and convert them back to single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| This was just six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| So that overlaps with some folks who are on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| That's part of the frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| The other part is that when we began the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| we began it as an affordable housing conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| We have an affordable housing crisis, and we've got to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| We went two years and finally are at a point where folks are willing to admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| okay, well, this won't produce affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| But maybe at some point in our lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| this additional supply will help bring down prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Then we moved into a conversation of missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Well, what is missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Well, we have these folks who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| they don't qualify for the subsidies or the vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Their income is too high for that, but too low for market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| But now we want to build market rate missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| and say that that's for the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Y'all do realize missing middle is about income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| It's not about the size of the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| It's about providing housing for folks who are falling through the gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| But now we're learning that's not going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| because we're going to have policies in place that discourage conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2095)|
| 0:35:06| And so we're looking at new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| We're acknowledging that new construction is going to be more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| likely market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| So not necessarily going to hit that missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:27| And I'm a proponent of inclusive zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| but I'm worried that the way that we're going about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| is actually going to work against the goals that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| because we've been talking about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And then once people see developments coming into their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| that aren't affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| that aren't for the middle-income folks in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| then that's when the resentment comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| And all of these issues that we haven't dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| the trash collection that doesn't happen when folks are parked on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| the mail delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And we're talking about, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| 100 years ago we had this many people in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Well, what was the quality of living at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| We had boarding houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| We had people who didn't have money, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| to afford regular apartments crammed into these kind of workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Is that what we want to go back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| So I'm confused about what the goal of this missing middle housing plan actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| Yeah, so I'm going to start my question with either Ms. Ball or, I know, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| So I'll let you decide who should answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| But I know I'm going to address some of the conversations about demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| There were some calls to some other cities that have already instituted this increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| I want to specify that one of the things that makes this different than RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| is that with RECODE we changed people's rights and we changed their zoning entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| and that's what the letter specified is that people's actual zoning designation might change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| because there were properties that went from commercial to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| from residential to commercial, or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| And we wanted those people notified, and that's what the letter was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| and that's what we voted to fund that for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| This is an expansion of rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| And Ms. Ball, when you and your staff called and talked to other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| that have expanded the zoning rights of properties to include, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| the Minneapolis went to everything could have a triplex at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| what were their observations about demolition in the places that were called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you for the question, Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| We called a number of different cities and found that none of them saw an increase in their demolition permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:23| after implementing middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| There was not an increase in demolition permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Did they see a swift increase in permitting for more than single family housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| Like what was the rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| For middle housing, all of the cities reported very incremental development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| of middle housing types throughout the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| and no one saw a huge rush of middle housing types just coming on board at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2334)|
| 0:39:03| It's very incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| It's going to vary, of course, based on the size of the city and the geography and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| but no one saw a significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| And can you refresh my memory about how we started this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:26| Because I think to address some of the comments that I've heard here about the Optico study happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| In 2022, Optico, and I may call on my colleagues with planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| as they were instrumental in that particular process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| but Optico worked in 2022 and completed their study in, I believe, September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| and provided the report at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| And what's the stated mission in what we were trying to accomplish with the Optico study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| I'm not going to be great at quoting the actual study off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| but I'm confident that I can call on my planning colleagues to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| The goal was to identify barriers to middle housing types throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| identify appropriate neighborhoods that would be appropriate for middle housing types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| and to help us identify what some specific zoning code changes might be that we could make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:40| to help facilitate middle housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:49| Did you all have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| But what's the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Like, what is middle housing and why do we want more of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Like, what was the goal stated in the Optico study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| I'm pulling it up myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| I mean, I can't quote the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| But, I mean, the goal was, just as Ms. Ball just described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| like we wanted to be able to restore the type of housing that has been successful within the TDR in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| and make it legal to create that kind of housing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| And that's the goal because it makes more walkable, sustainable, equitable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| It helps address our shortage of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| And it helps us grow as a city in a sustainable way without having to expand our boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| So middle housing is the type of housing that's been in Knoxville for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| It's now very, very difficult to build it, even in places that have had it for 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| So this was a recommendation for how to restore it in places that have been using this kind of housing in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| Ms. Brooks, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I mean, we could read the thing if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Look at some of it as you're going through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| My time is up, so I'll let somebody else ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Before we move to Councilmember Roberto, Director Brooks, if you could look at the mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| If there's anything that you think hasn't been captured by the discussion that you want to add, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| I don't know if it's like two paragraphs or two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Can you advise us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| I believe that it's been captured, but I'll take a closer look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| Okay. If there's anything to add, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Councilmember Roberto and then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| In the conversations I've had, one thing that has been brought to my attention many times is some level of clarity or confusion about what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:49| And so I was very glad to have some very wide-ranging and rather robust discussions with residents and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2569)|
| 0:43:02| One of the things that I think might need clarity is looking at page 74 in our packet, specifically the language in section 4.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:17| That language in that second sentence reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Middle housing types are permitted in R and 1, R and 2, R and 3, and R and 4 zoning districts located in land-use designated traditional neighborhood residential, or TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:38| My question was for Director Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| If council was to add some additional language here to make it very clear where this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| for instance, if we added the words, and shall be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| so that sentence would now be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Middle housing types are permitted in R and 1, R and 2, R and 3, and R and 4 zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| and shall be located in the land-use areas designated traditional neighborhood residential, TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| Would that be a substantive amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| No, that would be a clarification because it doesn't change anything, doesn't make anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| It just simply almost is a redundancy but does, in fact, clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| I think that's important here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| In the discussions I had with neighbors, they really wanted to see that kind of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| I'd like to make a motion, since this is not a substantive motion, and it would be a friendly motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| to add three words to that second sentence in the first paragraph in section 4.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:47| so that it would read, Middle housing types are permitted in R and 1, R and 2, R and 3, and R and 4 zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| and shall be located, and shall be located, in the land-use areas designated traditional neighborhood residential, TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2694)|
| 0:45:03| to add that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| I'll second as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Okay. Motion has been made to amend it as Council Member Roberto just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| Does anybody have any questions about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Motion to amend carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Council Member Roberto, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| If you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Yeah, I'll let...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Okay. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Turn your microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Obviously, got a lot of input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I've talked to many, many folks and read lots of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| I'm going to vote for this, but it is not without serious reservations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| and the points that Council Member Parker made and the person from Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:56| Ms. Thomas made, they're very well taken by me, and they made some good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| and those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I'm not sure exactly what the implementation of this is going to mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| That's honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| I hope that it does what we want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| But for the administration's assurance that this is going to be carefully tracked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:22| and we are going to have frequent updates so that we can actually see in reality how this is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| but not for those assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I would not support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| But I am going to go ahead and vote for it, hope for the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| I hope it's a good idea, but the concerns that were expressed here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| which I won't repeat because they were very well expressed, do register with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| So having said that, I will be voting for it, but it is without reservations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| and I will be scrutinizing this as it is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| So some of the concerns that have been brought up tonight are about affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| So since I asked my last question, I looked at the Optico study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| and you guys did give me some of the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| but it explicitly starts with the need for more housing choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| Increasingly, millennials and baby boomers are looking for more choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| in smaller places to live that are within walking distance of their lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| I have many neighbors like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| They end up, they can't age in place, and they have to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| because all we have are single-family houses that don't meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| And they have no choice but to leave because they don't want a 3,000-square-foot house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| or even an 1,800-square-foot house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| I visited a project down in Atlanta that AARP was actually there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| and partnering with them where they built small one-bedroom, one-bath houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| They were not tiny homes, but that met people's needs and that were affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| and the prices ranged to build them, and they were built during 2021 through 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| They ranged 70-some-thousand to 80-some-thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| and they met people's needs, and they were walking distance from the town square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| on an empty lot there and provided housing in a walkable area for people that wanted a small space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| Dustin, I'm sorry, I'm going to call you by first name and ask you to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| You shared some stats with me because one of the questions, the basics of economics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| and I'll tell you guys, I think I took an economics class, and I don't think I made an A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| but I get the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| The basics are supply and demand, supply and demand, supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| So could you tell me what you shared with me, this Pew study that talks about the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| and the rent changes in Minneapolis and other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| and if anybody wants the authoritative link, it's not just Mr. Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I'm not an authority like Pew is, so if you all know Pew Research and Pew Charitable Trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| So basically what I was sharing, and I'm sure planning staff can definitely speak to this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| but Minneapolis is a really, really good showcase for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| So back in, I believe it was 2017 or so, they essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| they did a lot more than what we're trying to do here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| So what they did is they legalized triplexes citywide, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| But what they did and what this study shows is it shows Minneapolis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| along with about four other cities, including Tyson's Corner, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| Portland, Oregon, and New Rochelle, New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| and essentially what you see is in cities where we have changed the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| to allow the missing middle typology of houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| is that because we're providing more homes for people, more total units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| we're matching the demand that people have for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| And so, for example, in Minneapolis since 2017, rents have increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| but they've increased 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| If you look at the state of Minnesota as a whole, it's at 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| If you look at the U.S. as a whole, it's 31%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| So the reality is, and listen, I'm not the biggest fan of the free market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| but the reality is it's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| And we have, we know we have this, tens of thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| who want to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| And I welcome them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Knoxville's a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| We cannot provide the units we need in the time we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| by just providing single-family homes, and we have the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Again, Pew has the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Many people have this data showing us that it is simple supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| If we build the units, we can catch up quicker to the deficit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| and rents might increase because everything's going to increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| but it increases at a rate to which folks like me who make $30,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| can't afford, and we're not going to wind up homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| So that's what this shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| And, again, if any of you all want this, I can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| email you the link, and planning can obviously speak to more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| but that's what Lauren is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| So in the last meeting, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| In the last meeting, we talked about tracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Ms. Ball, can you refresh our memory about how we plan on looking at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| I believe we talked about Ms. Crockett being a part of monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| any demolition requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Are there anything else we can do to monitor permitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Oh, yes, we will be monitoring this in a broad cross-section of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| and have met about that topic really for several months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| It's not new to us that we want to data track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| We'll be tracking things like the type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| which type of middle housing, how many units did it have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| what were the square footage of the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| what was the time between when they applied for a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| and they got a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Of course, we'll be tracking, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| demolitions on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| We have a whole list of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I will say I have struggled with this and still am struggling with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| because I do believe we need all types of housing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| I also hope we don't vilify RN1 single-family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| because a lot of people want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| A lot of people without a lot of money want a single-family home on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| in a subdivision or in a downtown neighborhood even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| My concern with this is that duplexes have been allowed in RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| with the use on review, and now it's by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| and so it changes for people who invested in an RN1 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| the fact that that zoning doesn't really exist anymore in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| So that's my one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I should have been a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| I can argue both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| So I see that, and that does cause me concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| But I also know that young professionals who remain single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| or have children or one day I will probably be wanting to downsize too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| and probably don't want a huge house, which I don't have anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| but I do have a huge yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| And so I do think, for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| missing middle is providing a type of housing and an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| for home ownership and wealth creation with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| who may not have had the opportunity to have wealth creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| and pass on generational wealth without a type of housing like missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| And the way that can happen is, you know, you buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| and the financial institution will look, if it's a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| at the rent you get, and that can help people qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| So I think this idea that only wealthy people will come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| and buy these may not be factually correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| So I guess what I'm kind of like my colleague, Councilwoman Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:48| I'm going to go out on a leap of faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| I have talked into yes and no every day this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| You know, yes, I'm going to be for it. No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| Yes, I am. No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And here today I think it is a risk worth taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| as long as we watch it every six months, not every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| I'm also not swayed by the Minneapolis data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| They've been doing it seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| That doesn't tell you long-term ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| So I also don't want to sit here and act like the answers we are getting are for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| and Knoxville is different than Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| So this is one of the harder votes I have ever taken on council, but I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:44| I said all along I would support it as long as it did not include R-in-1 neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| and that's been the thing that's been the hardest for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| because people who bought into an R-in-1 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| thinking they were going to have a single-family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| and that if somebody wanted to build a duplex in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| they would know about it and it would have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Now your house can be the next-door neighbor can split in two and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| and it just changes what people thought they purchased, and that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| but I do feel some compassion and angst for people that are going to find out that this happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| when their next-door neighbor starts making their house a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| That's why I want us to be watching this like a hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| I'm not going to repeat a lot of what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| I share sentiments with, I think, everybody that's spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| I'm really glad that we're going to have the workshop next week to discuss all the housing strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| because I believe the nine of us are very familiar with all the strategies that the city is deploying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| but I don't think the public has seen all of them and kind of put together in a package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| because none of them are going to solve the housing crisis alone, but they each play their role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| And this one is no different than the rest of them, but they all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| I have similar concerns related to demolition and change of character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| and similar to Council Member Fugate and Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| I am swayed by the mitigation tools in place and the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:39| Both of those two together, I think, have to be there in order for at least me to feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| that we can monitor this without anything getting out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| The last thing I would ask is since we saw housing prices spike two or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:55| there's been a lot of development that's happened in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| and so I was going to ask Mr. Sale, I saw you in the audience, if you could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| This strategy is not for fun, and so it is for housing, for people to age in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| it's for people to become homeowners, it's for people to rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| all in the place in neighborhoods that anybody else enjoys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| So since there's been a significant housing shortage in prices, there's been a lot of development in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| can you talk about any indications we have around rent growth or reduction over the past couple of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:37| Hansen, Sale, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Yeah, so in the immediate wake of the pandemic, so pre-pandemic our rental occupancy rate was around 96%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| which is a little higher than you want, you want 94%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| It surged to 99 in 2022, and directly as a result of that, rent growth exceeded 20% in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3531)|
| 0:59:03| However, in part from recode and a number of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| we saw a record number of rental units that are under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| and a record amount of supply that's hit the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| four times the amount of supply we've ever seen in one given year in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| and as a result, rent growth has fallen from 20% to 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and is probably going to continue to decelerate as we move into 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| So I think the data that was cited earlier about the other cities is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| but the supply injection slowing down rent growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| we have the data because it's happening in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Just to repeat, there's a lot of macro-level forces that move housing markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| and different cities are different for different reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| but you just said that housing in 2023, the development had increased 4x,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| but the rent had gone down from 20% increase the year before to 3% increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| Over the last two years, at any given time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| yeah, we've added four times the amount of supply on average over the last year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| than we had in the previous decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| I think Councilmember Parker is next, and then back to Roberto and Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:22| A few responses to what we just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| I continue to feel like this is an inadequate process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| and even the information that's being shared with us is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| We know that we have conditions that we have to deal with here in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:48| that other states don't have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| It would be great if we could put a rent cap on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| or if we could pass an ordinance that only allowed rent growth at a certain rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| but we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I don't know what Minneapolis has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| so I can't just look at that as an example that that one, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| I'm good at economics, but I'm also good at science, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And when you are testing out a problem, you can't just look at one factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| You've got to look at all of the different factors involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| unless you have like a controlled experiment going on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| So for me, there just hasn't been enough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| When we had the, and I know it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| I see the smiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| I'm just taking my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| When we had the public meetings or public events for people to come and learn about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| there was no presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| There was no information shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| The level of understanding that you have to have in order to go into a room like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| and ask questions to begin to understand what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| that's not an accessible, inclusive event for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| where we're really hoping for them to be brought to an understanding on what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:16| Many of the things and the concerns that have been brought up are around codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Yes, I hear that we're going to hire additional codes staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| but we need them for work that's going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| not for additional new areas of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| We need them to cover work that's not happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| So when we have concerns in neighborhoods about certain developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| I'm not convinced that we are either committed or even have the capacity to respond to those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| and that's where we really should be focusing our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| When I've spoken with some of the supporters of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| they like to point to the bus routes that go through the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| But what I like to remind folks of, because I've lived in walkable cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| D.C., the Netherlands, Italy, all over the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| you have to be able to take that transportation somewhere, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| We just went through, CAT reimagined, and talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| do we want to increase ridership or do we want to increase coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| Well, we largely went with ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| The folks who wanted coverage, the folks who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| I need to get to Turkey Creek, I need to get to the mall, the change and the stop at the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| I need to get to my work over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| those weren't the voices that were prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| So we have to put a better public infrastructure in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| We can't compare ourselves to cities where you can actually take the public transportation somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| and come back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| You can actually use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| You can actually park your car for a week and not even look at it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| We haven't built our infrastructure up in this city in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| and we have to be realistic about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| I was looking through Chattanooga's form-based code recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| One thing, because I'm looking at parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| I'm looking at what Chattanooga's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| but one thing that struck me about their form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| which is similar to this misdemeanor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| is they actually put in the ordinance a review of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| There's language in the ordinance that says this will come back before city council for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| That's missing from ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| So there's a lot of reliance on the fact that we're going to get some sort of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| but it's not in here by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| It feels rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| It feels like misplaced priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| and honestly, I'm ready for us to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| so we can actually focus on affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| That's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Council Member Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Thinking about clarity and understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| I wanted to ask Director Brooks a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| When we look through, and this is easier, I think, for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| because we live with this day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| and I think when you go out into neighborhoods and you start talking to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| some of these terms don't make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| like missing middle or TDR and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| So just thinking about clarity and easier understanding going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| there is a good definition of TDR that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| and that's used in this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| And my question for you is, as we kind of move on from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| and that definition is not in the definitions list in this zoning amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| my question is, would you be willing to work with Director Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| on looking at whether or not taking the existing language that defines the TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| and adding that to this at a future date would be a good thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| I think that would add a lot of clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| and would help a lot of folks understand better what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| Council Member, I would be happy to have further conversations about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| It's not been our practice to incorporate land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| into the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Those are part of our sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| and they are part of the one-year plan that's reviewed annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| by Planning Commission as well as this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| but I'd be happy to have further conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| I just think that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| I mean, the definition is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| It really kind of discusses the infrastructure that is the focus of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| which I think is also a good development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| where it's talking about lots that are less than 50 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| They usually have sidewalks and alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| This area is essentially an early 20th century grid street neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| So I think that would be a useful thing to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| and just make sure that's something that we could add for further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| On that same point, in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| the Planning Commissioners are going to take up the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| So what I was wondering about there is there's a lot of confusion out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| about the TDR because the traditional neighborhood residential land use area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| doesn't even work out to be TDR when you abbreviate it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| So there's a lot of confusion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| And after we presumably will pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| we're going to be referencing in this amendment the TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| and I'm just thinking ahead into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| Somebody who's looking at doing this in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| is going to see references to the TDR in the Zoning Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| They're going to be able to see the map and see where the TDR is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| And so my question there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| would it make sense to change the name of the TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| to something that is referencing middle housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Now, I'm not going to on the spot ask you to be creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| and figure out what that might be, nor am I going to figure out what it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| but my question is it's not something for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| but could you consider looking at when you do the one-year plan amendment and update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| could you look at whether or not it makes sense to make a change to that name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| considering what we're doing tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| And then at the same time, if you do decide, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| it does make sense to make that change for clarity going into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| which I think it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| then we would need to also update the language in this zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| so that it would also correspond with that same name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| whatever it is that references middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Does that seem fair as something you could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| to see if that would be a good thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| I have to admit that would be quite the undertaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| for us to change that land use classification name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| There's probably some – there's something that we'd need to talk about internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| It doesn't make sense when you – the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| I can't tell you where that originated from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| but we'd be happy to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| We have already completed the two public input sessions for the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| but it's definitely something that we can talk about and consider over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| I would appreciate that because I do think now this is a topic where everyone's talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| It's obviously front and center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| There's a lot of discussion about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| but many years from now that might not be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| and we just want to make sure things are very clear for everyone going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| So I would appreciate it if you'd look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Yeah, I'll just kind of wrap up and say some of the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| and some of the questions that have been brought up have been about concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| about how people who live within the TDR areas feel about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| and I've had lots of people reach out with support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| In fact, today I was in a hurry to get here because we had a 5 o'clock meeting before 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| and someone from one of my areas called, and I was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| I don't really have time to take this call right now, but I've got to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| and that's not what they wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| They wanted new playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| Those are the kind of calls I'm getting from my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| It's not about I don't want to live next to a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| I went and met with the Fairmont Emerland neighborhood about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| and they were very receptive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| and it's striking how many duplexes there are on Fairmont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| I didn't notice that actually until quite recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| I understand that a lot of us want to live in a single-family house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| but I will say throughout this process the more I've learned about the origins of zoning and housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| there's definitely a lot to be studied and to be learned there about how we ended up going down this pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4317)|
| 1:12:07| But when people had the choice to build what they wanted on those 50-foot lots in those TDR areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| whether that makes sense or not, the layer was chosen because it's in the map and it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| and it was a way to define an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Predominantly, they chose single-family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| so they built single-family houses in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Charlie and I both live in them, and that's what they chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| They could have built duplexes, they could have built tris, they could have bought six-plexes, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| They did some, and they obviously do quite a bit on Fairmont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| and often what you would see is somebody would build their own single-family house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| and then they would build another single-family house to be a rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| and another single-family house to be a rental or to sell, or they'd move around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| and that's how a lot of our neighborhood got built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| was people individually developing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| But they focused mainly on single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| This is about creating options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| There's a big call for it, the move from single-person households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| We just culturally, that was the point of the information that got shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| is culturally we have changed in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| and we're not big, large families with multi-generations living in houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| That's not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| And so we just need to reconsider our policy and how we develop housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| as we move forward to make it right-sized and appropriate to our cultural norms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| and those seeking housing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| And the last thing I'll say, and not use my whole five minutes, it'll be a miracle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| is that we can say we want to keep studying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| and we can say we don't want to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| and we can say that we want to only look at some other strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| but at the same time people are trying to figure out how to pay $1,500 for a one-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| It's not going to get any better until we implement multiple prongs of multiple approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| to be able to figure out how to get more housing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| And the last meeting that we had over dinner was about strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| and ways to prevent and deal with sprawl into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| which creates a lot of things people don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| So we have the ability to increase density in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| We used to have much greater density until people left and went to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| And so this is an approach that will address those needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| and create more housing at a time that it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Council Member Thomas and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Council Person Ryder, do you think I live in a single-family house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| I have no idea. I just know you live in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Okay. I thought you were talking about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| You live in the TDR, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I do. I live in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| It sounded almost like you and I lived in single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| I don't. It's a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| I have an apartment downstairs that I rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| and it's worked for me in lots of ways that people have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| And I've rented it to people I've known for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| and didn't know at low market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| So anyway, that's just a little bit of information about my personal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| I haven't lived in a single-family residence since it was the house I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| But this one's close. It's a small apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| But the main comment I wanted to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| and I wanted to follow up on Council Member Fugate's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| about the attitude towards single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| And the people I'm thinking about are people I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| and there's a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| and their dream was to have a single-family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| where they could raise their family in a quiet neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| and they work at manual labor, and they work for hourly wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| And after years and years of that, they have been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| And they have an expectation that the city will protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| to a certain degree, to a reasonable degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| the neighborhood that they chose to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| And those are the people that I'm thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| And I know the stuff about the missing middle is very well intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| and I really hope it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| But one thing I must say that's concerned me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| about the conversations I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| from the people who are in favor of missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| is they don't seem to acknowledge that group of people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| And it's almost like there's an attitude about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| RM1, you know, that's kind of privileged, and you got it made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| and I'm out here struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| That ain't the case for most people, at least in my neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| So I'm asking you a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| I don't want to be too strident about this, but I got to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| that has been missing from the conversations that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| with people supportive of missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| And, you know, we talk about the fear factor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| like that's just something that should be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| If you've worked that hard all your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| to raise a family in a relatively quiet neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| you have a right to be very seriously concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| about what you've worked for your whole life changing dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| So I just wanted to add that to the mix of our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I would just add that this is nothing to vilify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| for single-family detached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| Those are a perfectly great way to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| That's what a lot of our housing stock is, and this won't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| What it will, I hope, do is give more people a chance to buy that starter home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| It is impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| It's really, really hard to find a house under $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| It's even harder to find one for sale under $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| So for working families to be able to afford to buy a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| I think this will give more options for people to buy that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| Maybe it was Councilmember Fugate who was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| you can build equity in a home that you buy that's part of a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| I hate to personalize things, but just like you, I live in a stacked duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| and when we were buying our first and only home that we've ever bought 23 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| there was a tenant already in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| and that helped us be able to afford our mortgage payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| I'm not in that position anymore, but like you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| we still maintain the apartment because it's just another way to provide one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| with another housing option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| So the need has switched in my individual case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| but we would not have been able to buy a house as easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| without having it be a duplex with that rental income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| And so this isn't going to diminish the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| or the protection of existing single-family detached house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| It's just going to add more options for particularly vacant lots within the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| And I am committed to reporting back to this Council in six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| as you guys have suggested, and every six months thereafter as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| And I'm confident that this is going to work as intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| and that in a few years we're going to be really grateful that we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| hopefully, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Councilmember Hesley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| I'll just go to you since you haven't spoken yet this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| You said in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| I don't remember saying six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| I thought we were going to have a tracker on the city website somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| We will be monitoring continuously and sharing back to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| but we can do something more official no later than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| If people could see what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| it would save city employees from answering the phone all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Yeah, we are working on tracking data and being able to have dashboards about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| So we will try to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| but we can provide information in a more analog manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| even before we have some of those bigger systems set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| And I feel like everybody is picking on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| like all the people that are living in R and 1 feel like they're being picked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Hanson, what's the percentage of the city housing stock that's R and 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| I know you wanted to come back to that podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| I think it's 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I think Director Brooks might have that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| but it's the vast, vast majority of the city of Knoxville is single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| So nobody is picking on R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| I mean, I live kind of in a big old house myself that I don't need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| so let's get something so I can move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| But I don't think anybody is going to do anything with R and 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| and most of these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| don't they already have forms of this housing in them that's within the TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| That doesn't make sense, Andrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Within the TDR, there's no neighborhood that's predominantly R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| There's already a mixture of housing, including duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| but they just wouldn't be allowed to be built today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| And this is what this will restore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| the right to build a variety of types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I wanted to bring up another point that's being lost about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| and how people pick housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| You know, people pick neighborhoods oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| because they want to be in certain neighborhoods, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| They want to be around certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| Perhaps there's something culturally that's pulling them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| But also, when looking at housing, when you are a minority in a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| you have to think about where you're living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| And I remember when I was looking for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| I had come back from D.C. and was moving back to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| and I went to multiple properties in our city within the last decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| and was turned away because they did not want me to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| because of the color of my skin, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| And so when I hear density, density, density, I'm thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| okay, but how do we ensure harmony within these communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| And when we're not being intentional about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| we're not doing anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| When we're trying to understand why some people want single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| or who want space, who want privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| maybe it's discriminatory conditions that we're living within in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| that's forcing us to have to find those spaces, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| What can we do in these areas where we already have a mix of communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:21| but that lack of economic empowerment, that lack of ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| that lack of, that's what ties you to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:34| And what I'm worried about is communities that are already low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| becoming more investor-owned and less owned by the people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:53| I don't want, I have not heard NIMBY arguments this entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| What I have heard from people is we need affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| and I'm afraid these changes are going to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| the cost of living in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| And tonight we said, yeah, it might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| It's probably going to do it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| But then it's going to even out eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| And if I were a renter in this market right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| that would not bring me comfort because we're surviving on a day-to-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| If you're a renter, you don't have money put away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| for when it's a brighter day two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| You're wondering what your government officials are doing for you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| to relieve the stress that you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| And I don't see us committing to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| We're redesigning cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Fun stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| But we're not providing the housing that people actually need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| And I truly believe, based on the discussion that took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| at our last city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| that this will likely be a nothing burger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| I do believe the code is written in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| where we're not going to see conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| There aren't that many vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| We're not going to see a lot of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| I don't know where these duplexes are that people are going to be buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| That's the argument I'm hearing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Someone can buy a duplex and then rent out the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| But those aren't built, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| We're making these zoning changes so new developments take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| So we're expecting the working class to take out these construction loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| and build duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| I'm not a banker, but when I went through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| it did not seem amenable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| But, of course, I have a lot of college debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| When I talk about reviewing these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| part of it is reviewing things we've already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| renovating historic buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| and converting those into senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| Those are smaller units that seniors can move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| But what's happening with those now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| six years later or so after they've been opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| after we've put so much effort into subsidizing and rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| to get those set up for senior housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Well, they're not affordable and so they're not being filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| And so now a new business plan is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| This is the thinking I want us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| so that we do actually produce housing out of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| I just really appreciate the discussion I've heard from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| You know, what we're looking at here is having a diversity of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| and a diversity of housing includes R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| It includes all types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And in order to get to a point where we can build in the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| that we need to address our current lopsided demand supply issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| is in a diversity of housing and more units of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| We're seeing unprecedented popularity in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| and along with that has come an influx of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| and we're not going to restore price stability in this market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| either for owners or renters unless we have more supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| And so we've got to address the supply issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| and I think that's this, while an imperfect vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| this proposal is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| It is a way for us to build in more available housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| and impact affordability long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| but we've got to build in more in order to have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| There was some discussion tonight about recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| and one of the things that I think is really good about this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| is that it removes ourselves from the thinking that predominated in recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| which was a one size fits all solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| and instead looks at infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| and that's where we're looking at doing this with the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| and I think that's great and I hope that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| We need more supply and we've had many conversations about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| what's the next step after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| and I think it's mixed use along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| That's where we have more opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| I've heard folks talking about underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| or vacant commercial properties along our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| We have space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| That's where we can start to build in a lot of supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| and I hope that the next conversation we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| is about mixed use along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| and engaging as much as we can in increasing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I just want to thank my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| We've had a lot of robust conversation around this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| not only this evening but at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| Primarily what we're experiencing here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| is just what's called plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| We're having growing pains in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| because we've had such an influx of growth in such a short amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| and change is never easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| It's very uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| and I do want us to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| that we don't allow those growing pains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| and some of the changes to negatively impede those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| who have lived in Knoxville all of their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| who've invested in properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| We know that rents are outrageous in most parts of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| pretty much across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| and those are things, as Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| and I think some others have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| we, this Council, have no control over that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| That is strictly up to the landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| as to what the price point is for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| that they have available on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| But I do want to say that we all should be watching this very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| just to make sure that there are no unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| that could negatively impact existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| And so, like any other homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| you know, there is a slight concern about the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| and what it will actually look like as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| But again, I think that these are some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| this is just one step into addressing those growing pains that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| I mean, we are on top of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| with the mayor's housing commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| that she's made to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| and this is just one part of many to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| And I will be watching it closely as I think that we all will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| including the mayor's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Yes, no surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| I appreciate the person's, Roberto's comments on the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| It's not going to surprise anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| Oh, I know what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Yes, I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| I hope for the best, and I know it's well-intentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| but I have doubts that it's going to really address affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| and the amount of housing stock we actually need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| This may help some, but if you look at the amount of available lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| you can already build duplex all over my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| Now you can build triplex and fourplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| but how many units is that going to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| How affordable is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| So I don't want to disparage the efforts that we're making here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| because hopefully it is in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| But to me, the real opportunities, as I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| and many of us have said, is on the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| And the corridors are blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| and there's all kinds of space on the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| There are reasons why that hasn't been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| But if we really want to make significant changes in housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| that's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| So I look forward to the workshop next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| and I really appreciate all the comments that were made by Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and all the input I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| and all the people that had the courage and the passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| to come up to that microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| I want to address unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| We seem to have a lot of fear around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| but right now what we're experiencing are the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| of zoning changes we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I'm going to ask Mr. Sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Do you know when the zoning changes happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| to where we stopped making triplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| or in the TDR areas where we really started making it single homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| The 1940s, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| when we started to shift zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| the style of zoning to more suburban single-family only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| I mean, the traditional mode of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| particularly in the TDR, was not exclusive to single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| So what was going on at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| The history of zoning is replete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| with some of the worst instances of racism and discrimination in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| That's not the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| There are non-racist reasons for upholding things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| that were created for racist reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| But in the history, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| single-family zoning really originated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| after the Supreme Court struck down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| not allowing African Americans to live in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| After that was deemed unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| the large parts of the United States moved to single-family zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| because that was a big enough home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| that an African American family, on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5658)|

| 1:34:23| So there's a lot of history in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| But obviously, there's many reasons to retain single-family zoning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| Like, it's not racist intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| but as I said, non-racist reasons for upholding some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| that had a lot of discriminatory undertones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| So there's certain things with racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| with nasty capitalism that are always going to creep in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| But it feels like even if we have investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| owning these duplexes and quads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5691)|

| 1:35:01| I do think we need to pay attention to gentrification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| and not pricing people out of their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| And that's something that I think we should work on along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| But those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| But every single week, we have people here at public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| talking about they just want a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| And to me, listening to that consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| makes this a very easy yes for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=5725)|

| 1:40:40| I know that you have something coming up in that area, but that's my immediate feeling when I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:52| Bernadette West, 940 Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| I think that the word asylum has changed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| And so, I mean, even when you think about it in today's standard, in a certain context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| when people are seeking asylum, they're trying to seek a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| And that's what it was referred to when that street that is actually in front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| was originally called Asylum Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| And we wanted to change it to Asylum Avenue District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| because that's where people went to be safe and be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| And so the context of the name has changed over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| where it's not as favorable or it's thinking of the context that you're thinking of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:45| but we want to kind of get it back to the original context of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| And that's why we wanted to, because it was an address that was very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| during the time period when it was first built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| And the Asylum Avenue was there even though the asylum was up the street from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| where the people were staying for the deaf and blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| And so that's why we wanted to kind of just continue it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| because that street was, when the Western Avenue got built, that street was done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:21| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| Microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| You're making Lunaverse there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Well, the whole area is going to be the Honorable Asylum District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| And then all the different buildings, there's three buildings there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| and each one of them is going to have kind of a different character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| but it's kind of continuing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| The Samson right now is mostly the soccer complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| but we want to continue that into more kind of an entertainment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| that has not only music, but other things that are activities that can go on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| that can go on from day to night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| And so we'll have big games you can play like marble racing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| and duck pen bowling and volleyball and bocce ball and all that kind of stuff in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| So we want to kind of make it another kind of entertainment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| So I wish you lots of luck, and I plan on being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| But I'm still bothered by the name, just the history that it brings to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Vice Mayor Smith, do you have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| Council Member Singh, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| Okay, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| I was just going to ask Councilwoman McKenzie what the conversation was like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| at Public Property Naming Committee regarding this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| I'm going to defer to Vice Mayor Smith on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| But let me just say that I like Councilwoman Singh at first glance hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| I know it kind of brings that negative connotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| but thank you for explaining what your interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| and what you wanted to symbolize and mean, which is that safe space, that calming space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| A lot of times when we think of an asylum, we think of people who are mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| and back in the day you were called crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| But as you indicated, this was a place for the deaf and the blind to be in a safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| and not to be vulnerable and become victimized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| So I think it's going to be exciting and interesting like most things that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| It's also good to see Rick Emmett sitting there and having your back on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| But I'll defer to Vice Mayor Smith to talk about that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| This is before we pass the chair baton, so I'll chair this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| If you'll look in your packet on page 425,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Jack Neely has penned a little bit of a history about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| So he's on the Public Property Naming Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| was able to have that same conversation we've kind of landed on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| which is the original meaning of the word being safe space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| and given the creative nature of what's going to happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| they wanted to reinforce that original term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Sometimes it's important that we reclaim history of what its original name meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| And as part of that, Mr. Neely was advocating for this and was excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| as was the board in unanimous support of this after understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:37| So that's some context for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| And only the best group chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| Only the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Only the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| That wasn't microphone time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| I don't know if that's on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| It's in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Yes, I totally understand why Council Member Singh would have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| You need to put your microphone on every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| You have to remind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| I totally understand why Council Member Singh had that reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| I didn't have that reaction, but it was only because that I was familiar with the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| And just to add on a little bit, like even in James Agee's A Death in the Family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| which is set in Fort Sanders, he makes reference to the Asylum Avenue viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| Many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| So I didn't have that reaction, but if I had known that context of it, I may very well have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| So I'm glad that we've had this discussion to kind of clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| You've got some public awareness to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| If Jack Neely is okay with it, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| High praise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| We'll have to let him know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| necessary to acquire property for the Washington Pike Roadway Project by negotiated purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| or by condemnation if necessary within 56 tracts of real property for a total amount not to exceed $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Motion to approve has been made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| Council Members, both 11C and D are items that will allow us to continue to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:35| on the long way to Washington Pike Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| This project includes installing traffic lane improvements, turn lanes, multi-use pedestrian and bike paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| crossing improvements, and implementing ADA accessibility upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| This project is important for many reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| but chief among them is that a recent study showed an average of one crash every four days along the project corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| with 20% of crashes rated as severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| So the recently completed Vision Zero Action Plan also identified Washington Pike as part of the city's high injury network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| and this project is an opportunity to provide a complete street that aligns with the city's Vision Zero initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| of eliminating traffic fatalities on city roads by 2040.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| So thank you for your consideration and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| And no one signed up to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Are there people here from the community here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| I know Kevin's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Did anybody else join you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| I know Kevin shared with me some comments, and I got emails from others that couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| This project's been a really long time coming, going back to, I believe, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| And I just want to acknowledge, though many of the folks in the community weren't aware that this has finally made it to the next step on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6531)|
| 1:49:00| they didn't have a lot of warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| Because this has been going on for a very long time, but the members of the community put a lot of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| and came to many meetings and staff accommodated and held meetings to get a lot of public input back in 2021 and 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:19| I believe there were about three public meetings back then to reignite this project after it got tabled somewhere around Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:28| Clabo 2014, maybe, or something is when it got tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| This is not small to the folks who live out there because, as you can see from the agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| there are 56 pieces of property that will be in negotiations with and if we pass and approve the right-of-way consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:49| The next steps will be to have a public meeting so that the people that own those parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| and affected community members get to meet who those consultants are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| Anyway, there's just a lot of people that don't necessarily are able or make it to a council meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:10| and I think I just wanted to acknowledge the time and efforts that they put into where this was redesigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:17| and downscaled just a little bit to make less impact on those parcels but also meets the needs of what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| which is a turn lane out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| Anybody who's gone to New Harvest, it gets very difficult to turn in out there and some of those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| as well as some of those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| There's a development there, and so I look forward to working with all the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| and all the community out there as they move forward and the right-of-way negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| I'm pretty sure by the time this project is done, the first time it got started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| I was not even thinking about running for council, and I won't be here on council when this project is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| but I do use that target and New Harvest, so I will go out there and meet people on the greenway out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| because that's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| This is going to include bike lanes and greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| And in some of the public meetings, community members in the subdivision out there that actually are county residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| came to talk about how excited they are that they'll be able to take a greenway to the park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| So I look forward to many more public meetings as this process moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| and we make sure that everybody knows what's going on over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Yes, kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Please put your microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| Kudos to Mr. Murphy about all the work you've done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| It was way before I was on council, too, and I was on the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| and I remember you calling those early meetings, if I'm not mistaken, under the gazebo at New Harvest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| and you've survived several heads of engineering and you've surprised more than one head of an MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6711)|
| 1:52:00| and you have continued to persevere with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| But it's been admirable, and I remember those early conversations that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| when you engage the city administration and the reasonableness and the analysis that went into how we've got a problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:18| we've got many things to balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| The history of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Some of the families had lived there for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| but then the acknowledgment of the need to solve these traffic problems and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:35| So the amount of perseverance and the time that you've put in has really been impressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| and I just want you to know that we really appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| and it's kind of an example of the way the process should take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| when community members approach the city to get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| So it's been really a good thing, and I appreciate it so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Could someone go over how the project has been scaled back and share that with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| Yes, Mr. Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| I'm sure I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| I'm Tom Clabo, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| So the original typical section of the project was four lanes with a median divide or a turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:32| but the section, we had several meetings with folks from the Oak Grove neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| and their desire was that that section be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| We looked at some traffic analysis and determined that we could go to a three-lane section in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| So it's really from New Harvest Park up to Mill Road would be a three-lane section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| Outside of that, we pick up quite a bit of traffic volume from Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| so it's back to a five-lane section east of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| And then I see multi-use pedestrian and bike paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:13| Can you help me understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| So the entire corridor has a 10-foot wide shared use path on the north side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| so that would be the same side as like Target, the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| and then an 8-foot sidewalk on the south side of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| And so I don't know if I need to ask our neighborhood leader who we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:39| but we do not have others from the neighborhood present tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| and I'm hearing from Councilmember Ryder that some were surprised that this was coming to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:54| Would you mind coming forward and helping us understand what conversations have looked like with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| and how the neighborhood is feeling about this plan now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| We had been checking, and we hadn't seen anything on the website updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and then we saw it on the agenda, so we're like, oh, something's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| And the last public meeting was June of 2022, so we're 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| I do appreciate Councilwoman Ryder did a lot of quick checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| and communicated very quickly with us to let us know what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| so we really appreciate that, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| And then Tom Clabo also gave us a good email today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| When I talk to the people, I've talked with Dan Anderson and Dr. Theodore Jamieson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| and some of the others in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| Really, Dr. Jamieson today, one of the things she said is she's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| I just want to make sure that three-lane segment is staying put in, which it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| The design's not changing and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| So I think people were like, it was the initial shock, oh, something's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| And then I think everybody is now, okay, we're 24 hours later, we're a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| And we know that at least that there is some movement, and most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| we know there's a public meeting coming up that will introduce the next phase right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| So I think we're happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| That aligns with what I was hearing from neighbors when I met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| I think it's been a couple of years now, was that section of the roadway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:33| And so I'm cautiously optimistic that this will be a plan that will please the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:42| and as well as meet our needs for the increased traffic we're seeing in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| So thank you all for your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Yeah, and I just wanted to clarify one of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| Mr. Clabo, you're welcome to chime in if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| I think some of the confusion from the community is the last meeting we had was June 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| And so the question was, what happened in 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| Like, why did nothing happen for such a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| So I'll let you answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| It's been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| This is another one of those federally funded projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| So every phase of the project goes through the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| So after we had public meetings and received that input and revised the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| there was a need to reevaluate our environmental document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| So that's what's been going on since June of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| We just last fall got approval of that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| And now we've been working with TDOT to get permission to move to the right-of-way phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| So we had committed early on that there would be a meeting to introduce the right-of-way phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| to introduce our consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7069)|

| 1:58:38| and do our best to adjust to those concerns like we have with all the other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:43| So I'm really pleased at, you know, the input we got from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7123)|

| 2:00:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| This is just time to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| But Mr. Clabo, can you help me understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| You know, we often see amended contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| For a while it was because cost overruns, inflation really got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| Is this, you know, are we seeing now more scope of work increase in contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| or are we still dealing with inflationary pressures because these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| were committed a while back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| So this particular contract, it's a unit cost contract and particularly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| biggest issue was we had poor souls when we were excavating for footings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| So that ended up having an additional cost to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| A lot of times what you'll see, especially like this when you see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| completion dates coming up, it's kind of cleaning up the loose ends of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| So we bid these and it's really very effective for the city and the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| in that it's a shared risk when we have these unit cost contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| So we're paying for exactly what we encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| We get prices for that up front and so it helps us get better pricing actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| I'm not picking on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| I just, we have a lot of these from time to time and we haven't talked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| for a while about what drives that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| People just see us passing them willy-nilly and we're not passing them willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| So I just appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7334)|

| 2:11:02| Mr. Murphy, about what your plans are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| And the primary concern for people in that area is the historic home and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| what the plans were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7871)|

| 2:11:33| what we can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| We'd like to use it as a shared office space for tenants that we plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7894)|

| 2:11:39| We want to do townhomes on that property, and then it'd be just a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| that they could do shared office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| And how many townhomes do you expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| Sixty-four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| Okay, around on the property there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7914)|

| 2:11:56| Have you considered doing or have you talked with Ms. Crockett about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| putting the home on the National Register when you're done with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7920)|

| 2:12:04| I think it's, to my knowledge, it's already on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7924)|

| 2:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| Have you considered doing an H-1 or any kind of protection for it, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| after the long haul when you're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| We're open to anything that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| It's not that we're wanting to close up anything where we couldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| where there wouldn't be a historic use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| And what's your time frame for when you would – when are you going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:39| get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| As soon as we get enough cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| Do I ask for that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| I don't know that I have any, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| Is there anything specific about the townhouses that just regular market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| rates that you're building there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| I know you've done some houses over on Greenback and some other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| We want to do what hadn't been done in this area, I don't think, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| much, is a pocket neighborhood of townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| So we're probably a year off by the time we ever get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| Well, thank you, and I look forward to us talking to you more as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| project moves along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| I'll let you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| I'm going to ask Mr. Murphy a question, if you don't mind, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| know we talked to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| But I just – Mr. Murphy, you own a similar historic home not too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| away from this, and I had the question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| Yours is on the National Register, correct, but doesn't have H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| Just curious what your plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| The very wise Ann Bennett advised me when I started my journey a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| time ago, if we had good designers and good architects to go ahead, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| the work, which then put on the National Register, and then put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| historic overlay on it, in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| Basically because if you do it any reverse way, first you document the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| current condition, then you have to justify all the changes and amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| your National Register application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| And if you have an H1, if you have a historic overlay on it on top, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| you add an incredible amount of building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| So if we have – so it can be – if you've got good people working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| it, good architects and all that, it can help a lot to smooth it if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| do that at the tail end of the project instead of ahead, which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| And the goal that you achieve by putting the H1 on at the tail end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| That protects for future owners, which is good because if we have – I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| hope myself is a good owner and Mr. Garnard is a good owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| But if you have good owners, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| But as soon as it passes hands, the H1 protects it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| In the county at least – I don't think in the city, but in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| you can actually – an H1 could extend outward as well so that adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| development might have to be at least complementary and compatible in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| terms of massing and some look and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| You could do your entire farm too, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| So if there was ever subdivision or anything, it would impact anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| else that was built adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-1?start=8115)|
