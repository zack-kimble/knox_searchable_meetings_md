| 4:43:18| we can encourage the administration to cancel the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16998)|
| 4:43:21| but I will let the lawyer speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17001)|
| 4:43:25| Council Member Fugate is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17005)|
| 4:43:30| That's the best answer I've gotten all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17010)|
| 4:43:34| Thank you for that clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17014)|
| 4:43:35| because that was shocking news to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17015)|
| 4:43:38| and got me a little excited for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17018)|
| 4:43:41| Sorry if I did not make myself clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17021)|
| 4:43:45| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| But keeping that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17027)|
| 4:43:48| I would feel better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17028)|
| 4:43:50| because it seems like folks are leaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17030)|
| 4:43:51| towards giving this a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17031)|
| 4:43:53| I would feel better if we amended this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17033)|
| 4:43:59| to take out the option to renew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17039)|
| 4:44:02| so that we ensure it comes back to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17042)|
| 4:44:05| before any further action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17045)|
| 4:44:06| especially if Chief Thomas is able to secure federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17046)|
| 4:44:12| that might prompt folks to want to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17052)|
| 4:44:16| with the program without too much public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17056)|
| 4:44:20| So I'd rather see it stick to a one-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17060)|
| 4:44:28| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17068)|
| 4:44:30| So I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17070)|
| 4:44:32| that we remove the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17072)|
| 4:44:37| and section one of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17077)|
| 4:44:44| beginning with the option to renew the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17084)|
| 4:44:47| for up to two additional one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17087)|
| 4:44:52| Okay, there's a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17092)|

| 4:50:30| must not exceed the actual cost of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17430)|
| 4:50:33| as determined by a cost of service study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17433)|

| 4:51:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17462)|
| 4:51:05| I think I'll have to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17465)|
| 4:51:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17469)|
| 4:51:10| We have some people signed up to speak on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17470)|
| 4:51:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17476)|
| 4:51:18| So we'll have three to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17478)|
| 4:51:21| four and three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17481)|
| 4:51:24| The first sign up to speak for is Oslo Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17484)|
| 4:51:27| Mr. Cole, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17487)|
| 4:51:33| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17493)|
| 4:51:35| Okay, Mr. Cole, if you could start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17495)|
| 4:51:37| by stating your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17497)|
| 4:51:39| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17499)|
| 4:51:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17502)|
| 4:51:43| My name is Oslo Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17503)|
| 4:51:43| I live at 3160 Washington Ridge Way, Department 2604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17503)|
| 4:51:49| I, first of all, want to thank the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17509)|
| 4:51:54| and Mayor Kincaid for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17514)|
| 4:51:58| on this matter today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17518)|
| 4:52:00| I'll try to keep my remarks fairly brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17520)|
| 4:52:03| I know it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17523)|
| 4:52:05| You know, I listened to the debate earlier this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17525)|
| 4:52:09| with regards to the mayor's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17529)|
| 4:52:14| as it addresses some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17534)|
| 4:52:16| many of the concerns that a lot of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17536)|
| 4:52:19| in the community have about the KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17539)|
| 4:52:22| And, you know, while I appreciate those efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17542)|
| 4:52:27| and believe they go quite a long way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17547)|
| 4:52:30| I still feel strongly that this particular amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17550)|
| 4:52:34| deserves the light of day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17554)|
| 4:52:37| and gives, in giving Knoxville residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17557)|
| 4:52:42| the opportunity to chime in on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17562)|
| 4:52:45| You know, recently I've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17565)|
| 4:52:47| with the Knoxville Service Industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17567)|
| 4:52:54| Knoxville Service Industry United Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17574)|
| 4:52:58| And we've been in communications along with the local NAACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17578)|
| 4:53:04| Appalachian Voices, amongst other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17584)|
| 4:53:07| We've been in communication with the KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17587)|
| 4:53:09| with their policies as they pertain to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17589)|
| 4:53:15| And, you know, while those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17595)|
| 4:53:17| have been fairly productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17597)|
| 4:53:19| it's dawned on me more so than ever before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17599)|
| 4:53:23| how important some of the decisions KUB makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17603)|
| 4:53:27| and their impact on communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17607)|
| 4:53:32| you know, low income wage or low wage communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17612)|
| 4:53:36| And so, you know, when I think about the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17616)|
| 4:53:42| that are being made at the board level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17622)|
| 4:53:46| it makes me really concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17626)|
| 4:53:49| how accountable are those board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17629)|
| 4:53:52| to the community that it serves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17632)|
| 4:53:54| And so if, you know, if you've got board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17634)|
| 4:54:00| who have basically, you know, close to a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17640)|
| 4:54:06| more than a decade, if they get elected to two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17646)|
| 4:54:11| you know, you start to question how accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17651)|
| 4:54:14| can you really hold these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17654)|
| 4:54:16| And, you know, no disrespect to any of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17656)|
| 4:54:20| of the board, I listened to a couple of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17660)|
| 4:54:23| earlier this evening and they sound like they have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17663)|
| 4:54:26| you know, they have the right, you know, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17666)|
| 4:54:31| their hearts are in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17671)|
| 4:54:32| Their hearts are in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17672)|
| 4:54:34| But when I think about these fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17674)|
| 4:54:37| and that these board members have been complicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17677)|
| 4:54:41| in allowing for these fixed fees to skyrocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17681)|
| 4:54:47| in a way that's been detrimental to communities of low wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17687)|
| 4:54:51| it makes me concerned about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17691)|
| 4:54:54| the members of that board are being truly accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17694)|
| 4:54:57| to the members of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17697)|
| 4:54:59| And so I think that one other point I'll make is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17699)|
| 4:55:05| I've served on many, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17705)|
| 4:55:10| nonprofit boards here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17710)|
| 4:55:11| I've never served on a board where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17711)|
| 4:55:17| the term was greater than three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17717)|
| 4:55:21| You know, and so it's mind boggling to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17721)|
| 4:55:24| it's head scratching to me that the KEB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17724)|
| 4:55:28| that's an organization, a community utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17728)|
| 4:55:36| would have such generous term limits for its board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17736)|
| 4:55:44| when their decisions or the decisions that they're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17744)|
| 4:55:48| are significantly more impactful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17748)|
| 4:55:50| than some of the nonprofits I've served on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17750)|
| 4:55:53| So I feel like this makes all the sense in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17753)|
| 4:55:58| to allow Knoxville residents to vote on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17758)|
| 4:56:01| that makes sense for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17761)|
| 4:56:02| And I rise in very firm support of this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17762)|
| 4:56:07| being added to the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17767)|
| 4:56:08| and allowing Knoxville citizens to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17768)|
| 4:56:13| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17773)|
| 4:56:14| I thank you again for allowing me to speak on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17774)|
| 4:56:17| and I yield back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17777)|
| 4:56:20| Thank you, Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17780)|
| 4:56:21| The next person signed up to speak for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17781)|
| 4:56:24| is Amelia James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17784)|
| 4:56:25| Ms. James, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17785)|
| 4:56:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17788)|
| 4:56:32| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17792)|
| 4:56:34| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17794)|
| 4:56:35| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17795)|
| 4:56:36| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17796)|
| 4:56:38| I'm Amelia James, 900 East Hill Ave, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17798)|
| 4:56:43| So since I moved to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17803)|
| 4:56:45| I would describe my experience with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17805)|
| 4:56:47| as decidedly neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17807)|
| 4:56:50| And I have the privilege of having a steady income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17810)|
| 4:56:53| and so my monthly utility bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17813)|
| 4:56:54| are debited to my bank account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17814)|
| 4:56:56| without me really having to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17816)|
| 4:56:59| And I'm guessing pretty much everyone on the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17819)|
| 4:57:01| is in the same boat as me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17821)|
| 4:57:03| And so reforming KUB's process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17823)|
| 4:57:05| to include higher levels of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17825)|
| 4:57:08| and community representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17828)|
| 4:57:09| just isn't something that I think about a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17829)|
| 4:57:12| But every day I do work with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17832)|
| 4:57:14| who generally don't have income privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17834)|
| 4:57:17| And so I know from my work that many Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17837)|
| 4:57:20| have a very different experience with KUB than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17840)|
| 4:57:24| They've told me that they often feel unheard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17844)|
| 4:57:27| taken advantage of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17847)|
| 4:57:28| and like they just can't get ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17848)|
| 4:57:30| when it comes to their utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17850)|
| 4:57:32| And I really believe that the mark of a strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17852)|
| 4:57:35| and ethical organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17855)|
| 4:57:37| is how they work with the most vulnerable people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17857)|
| 4:57:39| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17859)|
| 4:57:40| And so I'm really glad that the earlier resolution was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17860)|
| 4:57:43| to help make some changes to increase accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17863)|
| 4:57:47| My understanding is that shortening board terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17867)|
| 4:57:49| is something that needs to be addressed by charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17869)|
| 4:57:53| And so that's the reason that I really support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17873)|
| 4:57:55| this ordinance and putting this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17875)|
| 4:57:57| on a ballot initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17877)|
| 4:58:00| KUB should be an asset to all our community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17880)|
| 4:58:03| And by making these changes to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17883)|
| 4:58:05| to promote accountability and shorten terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17885)|
| 4:58:08| we can work to achieve that goal for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17888)|
| 4:58:10| but then also for the long-term future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17890)|
| 4:58:13| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17893)|
| 4:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17895)|
| 4:58:16| Thank you, Ms. James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17896)|

| 4:58:27| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17907)|
| 4:58:29| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17909)|
| 4:58:30| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17910)|

| 4:58:39| I've been a neighborhood watch coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17919)|
| 4:58:42| for over 30 years at the West Hills Park Neighborhood Watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17922)|
| 4:58:47| worked with police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17927)|
| 4:58:49| at the West Hills Park Neighborhood Watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17929)|
| 4:58:52| worked with police officers every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17932)|
| 4:58:56| And regarding the utility reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17936)|
| 4:58:59| I'm happy that it has got this far to come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17939)|
| 4:59:06| I am glad that the council has passed this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17946)|
| 4:59:11| and I look forward to more responsiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17951)|
| 4:59:16| And in order to do that, we need this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17956)|
| 4:59:19| We really need this on the ballot very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17959)|
| 4:59:24| As we've discussed tonight on other topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17964)|
| 4:59:28| you know, you can just sort of delay and delay and delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17968)|
| 4:59:31| And I would also like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17971)|
| 4:59:35| that some of the discussion tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17975)|
| 4:59:39| regarding policing and social work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17979)|
| 4:59:42| we see the indirect consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17982)|
| 4:59:46| when we put something off to another agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17986)|
| 4:59:52| another responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17992)|
| 4:59:54| I wanna talk about churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17994)|
| 4:59:55| who pick up the tab over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=17995)|
| 5:00:00| on holding things together for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18000)|
| 5:00:04| Many of you can relate to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18004)|
| 5:00:06| because you probably contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18006)|
| 5:00:08| to helping people keep the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18008)|
| 5:00:12| and keep their family together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18012)|
| 5:00:16| And some of these things could be improved upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18016)|
| 5:00:20| with more accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18020)|
| 5:00:23| more responsiveness to the consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18023)|
| 5:00:28| And also I've personally observed KUB favors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18028)|
| 5:00:32| has in the past, and I believe still these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18032)|
| 5:00:36| and its policies and procedures and patterns and practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18036)|
| 5:00:42| to favor larger businesses, existing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18042)|
| 5:00:46| wealthier business, rather than sometimes a small entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18046)|
| 5:00:53| into the business community with low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18053)|
| 5:00:57| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18057)|
| 5:00:58| I look forward to more transparency, more accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18058)|
| 5:01:02| and getting this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18062)|
| 5:01:05| I urge city council to take every step tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18065)|
| 5:01:10| to get this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18070)|
| 5:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18072)|
| 5:01:13| Thank you, Ms. Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18073)|
| 5:01:15| Now we'll move to the speaker signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18075)|
| 5:01:17| to speak against this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18077)|
| 5:01:20| First is Kathy Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18080)|
| 5:01:23| Ms. Hamilton, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18083)|
| 5:01:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18087)|
| 5:01:28| Okay. Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18088)|
| 5:01:29| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18089)|
| 5:01:31| You have, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18091)|
| 5:01:33| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18093)|
| 5:01:34| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18094)|
| 5:01:36| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18096)|
| 5:01:38| My name is Kathy Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18098)|
| 5:01:40| I live at 1528 Boxford Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18100)|
| 5:01:43| And I currently serve as the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18103)|
| 5:01:45| of the KUB Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18105)|
| 5:01:47| Previously, I served as the Knox County Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18107)|
| 5:01:51| of Finance for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18111)|
| 5:01:53| I've been a licensed certified public accountant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18113)|
| 5:01:57| for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18117)|
| 5:01:59| And so my career has been both in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18119)|
| 5:02:03| and in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18123)|
| 5:02:05| And I'm here tonight to respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18125)|
| 5:02:07| you vote no on the proposed art ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18127)|
| 5:02:10| amending KUB's charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18130)|
| 5:02:14| Amending a charter should be a careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18134)|
| 5:02:16| and a deliberate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18136)|
| 5:02:18| And I think that we can all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18138)|
| 5:02:20| that that hasn't been the case at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18140)|
| 5:02:24| This proposal has been fairly rushed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18144)|
| 5:02:28| so much so that you have it before yourself this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18148)|
| 5:02:32| after one hurried and incomplete workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18152)|
| 5:02:35| that ended without anyone being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18155)|
| 5:02:38| to ask all their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18158)|
| 5:02:40| But we have, that said, we've heard the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18160)|
| 5:02:44| that have been voiced by the coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18164)|
| 5:02:46| and we're willing to implement changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18166)|
| 5:02:48| that would promote a greater level of collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18168)|
| 5:02:52| and community engagement between KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18172)|
| 5:02:55| the city and customers that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18175)|
| 5:02:58| You all heard all those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18178)|
| 5:03:00| and the resolution put forward with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18180)|
| 5:03:06| that was approved earlier this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18186)|
| 5:03:11| The resolution that you considered gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18191)|
| 5:03:18| the go ahead to begin to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18198)|
| 5:03:20| to establish a community advisory panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18200)|
| 5:03:23| We've already begun to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18203)|
| 5:03:26| You also heard from Mr. Bolas earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18206)|
| 5:03:29| that we have plans to adopt a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18209)|
| 5:03:32| at the next KUB meeting that would codify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18212)|
| 5:03:36| our prior commitment to freeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18216)|
| 5:03:38| our residential basic service charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18218)|
| 5:03:40| at their current level for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18220)|
| 5:03:43| And we have also agreed to work with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18223)|
| 5:03:47| on her planned strategies regarding the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18227)|
| 5:03:51| of new commissioners to the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18231)|
| 5:03:53| To that issue, I would go back to the comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18233)|
| 5:03:58| that was made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18238)|
| 5:03:59| She's already committed that she has planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18239)|
| 5:04:03| to not reappoint anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18243)|
| 5:04:06| There will be new appointments that are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18246)|
| 5:04:09| when she makes the upcoming appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18249)|
| 5:04:12| And to Councilwoman Parker's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18252)|
| 5:04:14| about the fact that the mayor cannot guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18254)|
| 5:04:19| that she will be in office to not reappoint those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18259)|
| 5:04:23| when their term is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18263)|
| 5:04:25| I understand that, but we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18265)|
| 5:04:27| a much less rushed charter process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18267)|
| 5:04:30| This can come up again two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18270)|
| 5:04:34| And if it passes at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18274)|
| 5:04:36| just as if it passed now, that's a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18276)|
| 5:04:39| that those people will not be reappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18279)|
| 5:04:42| to their term on KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18282)|
| 5:04:47| One of the most troubling issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18287)|
| 5:04:50| that's in the proposed amendment right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18290)|
| 5:04:52| and there was a comment earlier about an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18292)|
| 5:04:56| being made to limit it to terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18296)|
| 5:04:58| and not to the remainder of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18298)|
| 5:05:01| of the proposed ordinance in charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18301)|
| 5:05:06| So I'm not really sure which one we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18306)|
| 5:05:09| but the rate issue as part of the charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18309)|
| 5:05:14| is really a concern that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18314)|
| 5:05:18| I'd like to point out there our fixed charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18318)|
| 5:05:21| are at levels consistent with recently completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18321)|
| 5:05:24| cost of service studies, and also that the rate language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18324)|
| 5:05:29| that we have proposed in the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18329)|
| 5:05:33| is problematic because it conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18333)|
| 5:05:36| with the city's and KUB's contractual covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18336)|
| 5:05:40| with current bondholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18340)|
| 5:05:42| It's been estimated that 0.25% of the bondholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18342)|
| 5:05:47| or 25 basis points in borrowing rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18347)|
| 5:05:51| for KUB's upcoming bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18351)|
| 5:05:54| over a current long range plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18354)|
| 5:05:56| would raise those borrowing costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18356)|
| 5:05:58| by as much as $27 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18358)|
| 5:06:01| That's $27 million that would have to be borne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18361)|
| 5:06:05| by our customers as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18365)|
| 5:06:08| of this proposed charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18368)|
| 5:06:12| So in conclusion, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18372)|
| 5:06:17| I hope that you will consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18377)|
| 5:06:20| and consider the fact that it's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18380)|
| 5:06:22| that has to be done tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18382)|
| 5:06:25| and that you would vote no on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18385)|
| 5:06:27| that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18387)|
| 5:06:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18389)|
| 5:06:31| Thank you, Ms. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18391)|
| 5:06:34| The next person signed up to speak is Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18394)|
| 5:06:37| Mr. Mamentoff, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18397)|
| 5:06:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18408)|
| 5:06:50| Mayor, I've enabled him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18410)|
| 5:06:51| He's still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18411)|
| 5:06:54| Am I now unmuted, Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18414)|
| 5:06:56| Yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18416)|
| 5:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18417)|
| 5:06:58| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18418)|
| 5:07:00| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18420)|
| 5:07:01| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18421)|
| 5:07:02| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18422)|
| 5:07:03| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18423)|
| 5:07:05| Gladly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18425)|
| 5:07:06| My name is Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18426)|
| 5:07:07| I reside at 1215 Great Oaks Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18427)|
| 5:07:11| in West Knoxville at 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18431)|
| 5:07:15| I am a lawyer, as most of you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18435)|
| 5:07:21| and my specialty is helping cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18441)|
| 5:07:24| and counties issue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18444)|
| 5:07:29| My law firm probably does 80%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18449)|
| 5:07:32| of the municipal financings across the state each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18452)|
| 5:07:36| and we do the vast majority of bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18456)|
| 5:07:40| for municipal utilities across the state each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18460)|
| 5:07:44| Our job as bond counsel is to do the legal work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18464)|
| 5:07:48| when bonds are issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18468)|
| 5:07:50| and part of our role is to explain to bondholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18470)|
| 5:07:55| and to market participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18475)|
| 5:07:57| what the security is for the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18477)|
| 5:08:01| I think all of you were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18481)|
| 5:08:03| with the letter that I wrote analyzing the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18483)|
| 5:08:08| It's evolved a little bit since I wrote that letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18488)|
| 5:08:10| but the primary concern is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18490)|
| 5:08:14| I certainly understand the sentiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18494)|
| 5:08:17| behind the concern about the fixed charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18497)|
| 5:08:21| The language as proposed is very problematic, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18501)|
| 5:08:26| because it is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18506)|
| 5:08:30| the intent may be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18510)|
| 5:08:31| but it's just very poorly drafted for my world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18511)|
| 5:08:34| where if I'm trying to explain to a rating agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18514)|
| 5:08:40| or to a underwriter what this language means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18520)|
| 5:08:44| it's really impossible for me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18524)|
| 5:08:47| It's either aspirational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18527)|
| 5:08:50| in terms of trying to minimize the fixed charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18530)|
| 5:08:55| with a limit based on the cost of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18535)|
| 5:08:58| or it's a shell minimize the fixed charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18538)|
| 5:09:02| which the only way you really can truly minimize something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18542)|
| 5:09:06| is to drive it down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18546)|
| 5:09:08| I think that market participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18548)|
| 5:09:11| will be very frightened by this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18551)|
| 5:09:14| that we'll get a lot of questions about this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18554)|
| 5:09:17| This language will be very unique in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18557)|
| 5:09:20| Tennessee has a extremely strong record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18560)|
| 5:09:24| of cost-sufficient borrowing by our municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18564)|
| 5:09:27| because there are no rate limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18567)|
| 5:09:31| generally statewide on most utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18571)|
| 5:09:34| And as a result, Tennessee municipal entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18574)|
| 5:09:38| have been able to borrow at very low interest costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18578)|
| 5:09:43| It would, this type of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18583)|
| 5:09:45| would be like the state legislature telling the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18585)|
| 5:09:49| that because property taxes affect people on fixed incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18589)|
| 5:09:53| that you need to minimize your property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18593)|
| 5:09:55| and rely on other sources of income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18595)|
| 5:09:58| such as charges for using parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18598)|
| 5:10:01| or a thing to help pay for difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18601)|
| 5:10:04| I would be the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18604)|
| 5:10:06| standing in front of the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18606)|
| 5:10:08| arguing that that would be a really bad idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18608)|
| 5:10:11| because the reason that Knoxville is able to borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18611)|
| 5:10:15| at such favorable rates as most counties and cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18615)|
| 5:10:18| is that we're one of the states in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18618)|
| 5:10:20| that do not have limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18620)|
| 5:10:22| that bondholders are really well-protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18622)|
| 5:10:24| When we've sold over a billion dollars of bonds for KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18624)|
| 5:10:27| over the last 20 years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18627)|
| 5:10:30| the bondholders have all bought them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18630)|
| 5:10:33| on the understanding that KUB had the legal ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18633)|
| 5:10:38| to charge rates consistent with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18638)|
| 5:10:41| sound business principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18641)|
| 5:10:43| which is what our state law provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18643)|
| 5:10:44| and not limited by these types of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18644)|
| 5:10:49| And to have to go into the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18649)|
| 5:10:51| with these kinds of limitations could be very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18651)|
| 5:10:54| And I just think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18654)|
| 5:10:56| I know there are limitations on timeframe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18656)|
| 5:11:00| but I think that you all would really benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18660)|
| 5:11:01| from hearing from other people, market participants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18661)|
| 5:11:04| before you take such a drastic step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18664)|
| 5:11:06| I know we reached out to the comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18666)|
| 5:11:09| who's really the only state entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18669)|
| 5:11:11| that has any sort of regulatory power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18671)|
| 5:11:14| relative to municipal utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18674)|
| 5:11:16| and the primary person that deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18676)|
| 5:11:19| with water and wastewater utilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18679)|
| 5:11:21| And I think you were provided with his response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18681)|
| 5:11:24| express serious concern about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18684)|
| 5:11:26| I also spoke to the director of local finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18686)|
| 5:11:28| about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18688)|
| 5:11:29| And she also expressed a lot of concern to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18689)|
| 5:11:34| about fully vetting this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18694)|
| 5:11:36| because it just would be an unfortunate precedent statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18696)|
| 5:11:41| to start having these types of limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18701)|
| 5:11:44| imposed on our municipal utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18704)|
| 5:11:46| So I hope that irrespective of other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18706)|
| 5:11:52| that you are concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18712)|
| 5:11:52| that you will follow what you all discussed earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18712)|
| 5:11:57| and not include this type of provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18717)|
| 5:12:01| in the proposed charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18721)|
| 5:12:02| and that you will thoroughly vet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18722)|
| 5:12:04| any sort of rate limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18724)|
| 5:12:06| and make sure they're very well drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18726)|
| 5:12:07| if you do decide to pursue them in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18727)|
| 5:12:10| Thank you very much for giving me your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18730)|
| 5:12:14| Thank you, Mr. Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18734)|
| 5:12:17| The last person signed up to speak on this is Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18737)|
| 5:12:22| Mr. Askew, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18742)|
| 5:12:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18747)|
| 5:12:30| Mayor, I'm going to enable someone to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18750)|
| 5:12:32| that may be Mr. Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18752)|
| 5:12:40| Jerry Askew, are you able to hear us or speak to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18760)|
| 5:12:45| Are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18765)|
| 5:12:46| Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18766)|
| 5:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18767)|
| 5:12:48| Yes, I am here on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18768)|
| 5:12:50| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18770)|
| 5:12:51| Well, it's your turn to address council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18771)|
| 5:12:53| on these item 12B, an ordinance to amend the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18773)|
| 5:12:57| of the city of Knoxville regarding KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18777)|
| 5:13:01| Please start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18781)|
| 5:13:03| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18783)|
| 5:13:04| You will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18784)|
| 5:13:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18788)|
| 5:13:09| Jerry Askew, 701 Cherokee Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18789)|
| 5:13:12| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18792)|
| 5:13:18| I was not aware that I would be speaking tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18798)|
| 5:13:21| and so all I have to say is that my primary concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18801)|
| 5:13:28| is that which is expressed by Mr. Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18808)|
| 5:13:32| We really need to keep as much flexibility as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18812)|
| 5:13:37| to be able to represent the rate payers as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18817)|
| 5:13:43| I guess I really do need to say a little bit more though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18823)|
| 5:13:56| I've heard a lot of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18836)|
| 5:13:57| about the Knoxville Utility Board tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18837)|
| 5:14:01| and I have to say I've been offended in many respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18841)|
| 5:14:07| I grew up in North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18847)|
| 5:14:13| My dad was a violent alcoholic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18853)|
| 5:14:21| I remember many nights taking cold showers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18861)|
| 5:14:25| because I knew that if I took warm showers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18865)|
| 5:14:31| the utility bill would be higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18871)|
| 5:14:34| and at the end of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18874)|
| 5:14:36| my mother would not be able to pay the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18876)|
| 5:14:40| and my dad would beat her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18880)|
| 5:14:42| And so, for those who say that we are not in tune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18882)|
| 5:14:50| with the poorest among us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18890)|
| 5:14:54| I have to say that many of us are not in tune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18894)|
| 5:14:59| and that many of us identify much more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18899)|
| 5:15:04| than we wish we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18904)|
| 5:15:09| When I talk to my colleagues on the KUB Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18909)|
| 5:15:16| I hear them constantly talk about the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18916)|
| 5:15:21| As many of you know, I am a deacon in the Episcopal Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18921)|
| 5:15:25| and my charge is to be the prophetic voice of the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18925)|
| 5:15:32| And so, I can't imagine the day that arises for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18932)|
| 5:15:40| when I don't think of what is best for the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18940)|
| 5:15:45| And every day that I come to work for KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18945)|
| 5:15:51| in one form or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18951)|
| 5:15:54| what is best for the poor is the most important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18954)|
| 5:15:59| And I have to say that when I hear the arguments from SACE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18959)|
| 5:16:08| I find them hollow, because if you look at the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18968)|
| 5:16:16| if we did what SACE calls upon us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18976)|
| 5:16:20| we would be hurting those that they purport to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18980)|
| 5:16:29| They continued to bring people before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18989)|
| 5:16:33| at multiple meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18993)|
| 5:16:35| talking about how KUB rates are hurting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=18995)|
| 5:16:41| But at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19001)|
| 5:16:44| if we did what SACE calls upon us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19004)|
| 5:16:48| they would, the people who would be hurt most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19008)|
| 5:16:52| are those who they constantly parade in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19012)|
| 5:16:56| And so, the only people who benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19016)|
| 5:17:01| from what SACE is calling upon us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19021)|
| 5:17:04| are those who can afford to put solar panels on their roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19024)|
| 5:17:11| So, I'm sorry, I get pretty emotional about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19031)|
| 5:17:16| but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19036)|
| 5:17:20| I think that the way we do business as KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19040)|
| 5:17:25| is in the best interest of the least of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19045)|
| 5:17:28| And that's what I am called to represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19048)|
| 5:17:31| and that's what I will continue to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19051)|
| 5:17:34| So, I encourage you all to vote against this measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19054)|
| 5:17:46| which is being called upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19066)|
| 5:17:52| Thank you, Mr. Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19072)|
| 5:17:55| That concludes the public speakers on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19075)|
| 5:18:01| Council members, does anyone have some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19081)|
| 5:18:05| or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19085)|
| 5:18:07| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19087)|
| 5:18:09| Mr. Thomas, I saw your hand first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19089)|
| 5:18:11| Yes, just some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19091)|
| 5:18:14| We've all, of course, been on kind of a fast track with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19094)|
| 5:18:18| and we've all worked hard to kind of absorb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19098)|
| 5:18:21| as much as we can and make a timely decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19101)|
| 5:18:25| I'm not sure what ordinance we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19105)|
| 5:18:28| to be honest about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19108)|
| 5:18:29| I know I've seen at least three drafts from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19109)|
| 5:18:33| First, it had multiple issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19113)|
| 5:18:36| then it was pared down to less issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19116)|
| 5:18:38| And then the last draft I saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19118)|
| 5:18:41| and I don't know if it's been submitted to the agenda or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19121)|
| 5:18:44| was simply on the issue of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19124)|
| 5:18:48| And I just want some clarification on the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19128)|
| 5:18:54| that's before us now and what we're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19134)|
| 5:18:56| to be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19136)|
| 5:18:59| Yeah, I'm gonna ask my deputy, Aaron Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19139)|
| 5:19:02| to give an overview of what's actually on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19142)|
| 5:19:05| I'm not sure what's been emailed to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19145)|
| 5:19:06| but what's actually on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19146)|
| 5:19:08| that you're about to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19148)|
| 5:19:11| Ms. Gill, could you just share exactly what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19151)|
| 5:19:13| in a summary form, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19153)|
| 5:19:17| Yes, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19157)|
| 5:19:19| So again, without an amendment before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19159)|
| 5:19:24| what is in the agenda is what is currently being voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19164)|
| 5:19:29| and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19169)|
| 5:19:30| And so that is what was published in the public on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19170)|
| 5:19:36| And you'll forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19176)|
| 5:19:37| I'm flipping through my council package language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19177)|
| 5:19:40| but I will summarize to say that it includes the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19180)|
| 5:19:45| that was inclusive of the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19185)|
| 5:19:49| And so the points that Mark Mimitoff made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19189)|
| 5:19:52| around the minimization language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19192)|
| 5:19:54| that paragraph is in the public agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19194)|
| 5:19:58| and the other elements around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19198)|
| 5:20:02| there's at least a language around nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19202)|
| 5:20:06| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19206)|
| 5:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19208)|
| 5:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19210)|
| 5:20:11| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19211)|
| 5:20:14| I just had a comment and would love further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19214)|
| 5:20:19| and would be happy also to offer an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19219)|
| 5:20:24| but I just wanted to thank the public speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19224)|
| 5:20:28| for sharing their thoughts with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19228)|
| 5:20:31| And I wanted to share a little bit of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19231)|
| 5:20:33| and why this is so important of an issue for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19233)|
| 5:20:38| but my first job in human rights work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19238)|
| 5:20:43| which was in 1998, was in Ghana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19243)|
| 5:20:49| I lived in Accra, Ghana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19249)|
| 5:20:51| and I received funding to go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19251)|
| 5:20:54| because I was working on investigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19254)|
| 5:20:59| how the city, the country really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19259)|
| 5:21:01| was moving from having public utilities to private utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19261)|
| 5:21:06| And so this has been an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19266)|
| 5:21:08| that I've been passionate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19268)|
| 5:21:09| because I've watched public goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19269)|
| 5:21:14| and we see it with housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19274)|
| 5:21:16| we see it with so many other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19276)|
| 5:21:18| have moved from being public goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19278)|
| 5:21:21| to being privatized over the last 20, 30, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19281)|
| 5:21:25| And a lot of the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19285)|
| 5:21:26| that the KUB board members and staff actually use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19286)|
| 5:21:31| makes me a little uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19291)|
| 5:21:34| I would say that our goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19294)|
| 5:21:39| well, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19299)|
| 5:21:42| is that we treat these items as a human right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19302)|
| 5:21:46| that they're guaranteed access to water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19306)|
| 5:21:50| access to heating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19310)|
| 5:21:52| I mean, we're starting to talk about internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19312)|
| 5:21:57| in the times of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19317)|
| 5:21:59| as something everyone should have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19319)|
| 5:22:02| It's becoming a basic right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19322)|
| 5:22:05| more so than water and food and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19325)|
| 5:22:09| These things we should be guaranteed just as a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19329)|
| 5:22:13| And the way that we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19333)|
| 5:22:15| is we come together collectively through government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19335)|
| 5:22:20| to provide those services for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19340)|
| 5:22:23| So I'm pushing for KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19343)|
| 5:22:27| to be less of a business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19347)|
| 5:22:31| and thinking more towards how can we ensure access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19351)|
| 5:22:39| to these very critical services that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19359)|
| 5:22:44| regardless of income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19364)|
| 5:22:47| and partner with our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19367)|
| 5:22:50| to make sure that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19370)|
| 5:22:51| And I feel like that's what our role is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19371)|
| 5:22:54| not ensuring their independence and access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19374)|
| 5:23:00| and ability to run a business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19380)|
| 5:23:04| And I just also wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19384)|
| 5:23:09| gosh, I can't remember now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19389)|
| 5:23:13| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19393)|
| 5:23:14| I'll come back to it if I think of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19394)|
| 5:23:16| but allow others to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19396)|
| 5:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19401)|
| 5:23:22| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19402)|
| 5:23:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19406)|
| 5:23:28| I also wanna thank everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19408)|
| 5:23:30| who's participated in the discussion this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19410)|
| 5:23:33| but there's been a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19413)|
| 5:23:37| over the last many weeks about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19417)|
| 5:23:43| And I really appreciate all the time everyone's spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19423)|
| 5:23:49| I know talking with me about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19429)|
| 5:23:50| but I have a feeling that there were a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19430)|
| 5:23:53| of conversations going on at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19433)|
| 5:23:58| The issue that I see is that what kind of the common thread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19438)|
| 5:24:04| to all of this, I think I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19444)|
| 5:24:07| is that we're wanting to encourage conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19447)|
| 5:24:12| We're wanting to have a look at a progressive type of model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19452)|
| 5:24:18| for dealing with these fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19458)|
| 5:24:22| And I think everyone can probably agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19462)|
| 5:24:26| with those being good goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19466)|
| 5:24:28| I think from all the parties involved in this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19468)|
| 5:24:35| The issue with the fixed fees in the current version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19475)|
| 5:24:42| that we've got before us right now is problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19482)|
| 5:24:46| in the sense that we haven't had a substantive workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19486)|
| 5:24:50| on how that might impact debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19490)|
| 5:24:53| And I know we've heard from several folks this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19493)|
| 5:24:59| about that that might actually change their bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19499)|
| 5:25:04| which could impact the very folks that were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19504)|
| 5:25:10| the attempt at doing this was being aimed at helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19510)|
| 5:25:16| And so I think that makes it very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19516)|
| 5:25:19| to move forward on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19519)|
| 5:25:22| because of that section in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19522)|
| 5:25:29| As to the other section, we're talking about term lengths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19529)|
| 5:25:33| And I feel like seven years is a very long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19533)|
| 5:25:39| for a term with the option for a 14-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19539)|
| 5:25:45| I do feel more comfortable with a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19545)|
| 5:25:49| And I do think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19549)|
| 5:25:50| that council could address this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19550)|
| 5:25:53| And I would be comfortable moving forward in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19553)|
| 5:25:58| But those are my thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19558)|
| 5:25:59| and I definitely wanna hear from my colleagues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19559)|
| 5:26:04| Ms. Testerman and then Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19564)|
| 5:26:11| We can't hear you, you're muted still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19571)|
| 5:26:14| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19574)|
| 5:26:16| So I'd first like to start with the board member terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19576)|
| 5:26:22| I know that Mr. Watson was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19582)|
| 5:26:25| sent us some comparable cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19585)|
| 5:26:28| I guess what are known as the big five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19588)|
| 5:26:30| the four cities in Tennessee, as well as Huntsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19590)|
| 5:26:37| establishing what their terms were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19597)|
| 5:26:41| Are their terms less than Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19601)|
| 5:26:43| They are, but none of those other cities have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19603)|
| 5:26:47| Knoxville is the only city that has term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19607)|
| 5:26:51| And I mean, you look at Huntsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19611)|
| 5:26:53| you've got a guy on there who's been there 39 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19613)|
| 5:26:56| Chattanooga has been on there 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19616)|
| 5:26:59| And so if you look at the average duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19619)|
| 5:27:02| of any of those boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19622)|
| 5:27:04| Knoxville is the least of those five at 5.9 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19624)|
| 5:27:08| And so I think what was mentioned earlier in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19628)|
| 5:27:16| is 76% of board members out of the 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19636)|
| 5:27:24| that was mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19644)|
| 5:27:25| have not been reappointed to a second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19645)|
| 5:27:29| And so the mayor's commitment to not reappoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19649)|
| 5:27:33| after seven years is actually less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19653)|
| 5:27:35| than the proposed two term of eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19655)|
| 5:27:38| that's being outlined in the charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19658)|
| 5:27:44| And so I guess I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19664)|
| 5:27:47| I struggle with that because that's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19667)|
| 5:27:51| that hasn't been clear, been made clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19671)|
| 5:27:56| So I think again, Knoxville's been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19676)|
| 5:27:58| KEB has been much more judicious when it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19678)|
| 5:28:02| And I just feel like the game keeps changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19682)|
| 5:28:07| I mean, it's, the goalposts keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19687)|
| 5:28:11| There are new versions of this charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19691)|
| 5:28:14| that are being put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19694)|
| 5:28:16| And, you know, I've got an issue with transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19696)|
| 5:28:20| I mean, we've heard about transparency through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19700)|
| 5:28:24| And, you know, it's been one thing that was put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19704)|
| 5:28:29| in the charter amendment that transparency is vital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19709)|
| 5:28:34| to at the core of this charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19714)|
| 5:28:38| But given that we had an emergency workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19718)|
| 5:28:41| that nobody knew about until less than a day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19721)|
| 5:28:45| KEB didn't even know about it until 24 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19725)|
| 5:28:48| after it was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19728)|
| 5:28:52| And it just, I guess my question is to say is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19732)|
| 5:28:57| you know, doesn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19737)|
| 5:29:00| the state's not deemed its own transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19740)|
| 5:29:03| equally as important when proposing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19743)|
| 5:29:07| as significant as a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19747)|
| 5:29:10| And they, you know, they've said that KEB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19750)|
| 5:29:13| was a long time trusted community member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19753)|
| 5:29:16| that supposedly lost touch with its customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19756)|
| 5:29:19| And I've already asserted that I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19759)|
| 5:29:23| But, you know, I vehemently oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19763)|
| 5:29:28| politicizing this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19768)|
| 5:29:32| You know, Council Member Parker was talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19772)|
| 5:29:34| about making it more government involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19774)|
| 5:29:38| You look at Memphis, they pray not to have a heavy rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19778)|
| 5:29:43| because, you know, it has become so politicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19783)|
| 5:29:47| They haven't invested in their infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19787)|
| 5:29:49| And I think the last thing that we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19789)|
| 5:29:55| not even talking about the financial implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19795)|
| 5:29:58| of bond rating, is to politicize this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19798)|
| 5:30:04| and undo the great work that KEB has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19804)|
| 5:30:08| and that they've invested in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19808)|
| 5:30:10| So, I mean, I could go through, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19810)|
| 5:30:13| I don't know what it is we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19813)|
| 5:30:15| but if it does come down to term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19815)|
| 5:30:18| you know, again, we're the municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19818)|
| 5:30:22| across five of the utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19822)|
| 5:30:25| that are actually, you know, established term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19825)|
| 5:30:28| And so I don't really know why we're reinventing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19828)|
| 5:30:34| Thank you, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19834)|
| 5:30:35| Ms. Fugett, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19835)|
| 5:30:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19839)|
| 5:30:40| I would echo what my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19840)|
| 5:30:43| Councilwoman Testerman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19843)|
| 5:30:45| What we're voting on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19845)|
| 5:30:47| is the amendment before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19847)|
| 5:30:49| because I haven't heard anybody change anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19849)|
| 5:30:52| But what I will say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19852)|
| 5:30:55| fundamentally, regardless of what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19855)|
| 5:30:59| I think this is too rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19859)|
| 5:31:01| A charter change is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19861)|
| 5:31:05| I'm hearing from other special interest groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19865)|
| 5:31:08| who are just finding out that this is on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19868)|
| 5:31:11| and they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19871)|
| 5:31:12| we weren't a part of any of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19872)|
| 5:31:15| Therefore, if we're going to have a charter proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19875)|
| 5:31:20| it should be more publicly vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19880)|
| 5:31:24| I've heard that Council doesn't have to like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19884)|
| 5:31:29| we just have to put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19889)|
| 5:31:32| I fundamentally disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19892)|
| 5:31:34| As a citizen who has walked into a booth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19894)|
| 5:31:41| to vote on charter changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19901)|
| 5:31:44| the average citizen assumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19904)|
| 5:31:46| that if it says City Council put it on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19906)|
| 5:31:48| that City Council fully supports the change being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19908)|
| 5:31:54| not City Council allowed it to be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19914)|
| 5:32:00| They infer that we are endorsing the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19920)|
| 5:32:04| So, if it comes down to an amendment about term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19924)|
| 5:32:10| I don't even feel comfortable voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19930)|
| 5:32:12| on what those should be today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19932)|
| 5:32:14| We haven't even had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19934)|
| 5:32:17| about what's the magic number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19937)|
| 5:32:19| Is it one seven-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19939)|
| 5:32:21| Is it two four-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19941)|
| 5:32:23| Is it three three-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19943)|
| 5:32:26| I just think that it is a bigger discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19946)|
| 5:32:30| than we have to be forced into making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19950)|
| 5:32:33| and we're not forced into making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19953)|
| 5:32:35| Many of the other issues have been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19955)|
| 5:32:38| and many of the other issues have been dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19958)|
| 5:32:41| And as Mayor Kincannon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19961)|
| 5:32:44| there's another bite at this apple in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19964)|
| 5:32:47| And if council does its due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19967)|
| 5:32:49| and wants to make charter changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19969)|
| 5:32:52| then we can do that then after we've had a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19972)|
| 5:32:55| and thorough vetting of what we think needs to be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19975)|
| 5:33:00| about the way the KUB board is governed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19980)|
| 5:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19984)|
| 5:33:06| Thank you, Councilwoman Cugat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19986)|
| 5:33:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19989)|
| 5:33:13| I am not supporting voting for this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19993)|
| 5:33:17| I feel like those who've asked us to vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=19997)|
| 5:33:23| we weren't first and it's changed so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20003)|
| 5:33:27| in a number of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20007)|
| 5:33:29| We didn't know what we were being asked to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20009)|
| 5:33:32| And I don't think the folks that are asking us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20012)|
| 5:33:35| to vote on it know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20015)|
| 5:33:38| Many of them think that we're voting on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20018)|
| 5:33:41| about rate changes and fixed fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20021)|
| 5:33:45| and that's proposed to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20025)|
| 5:33:46| and the language is even vetted to be legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20026)|
| 5:33:50| and not affect our bond ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20030)|
| 5:33:53| I also along the process was dismayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20033)|
| 5:33:57| that KUB was surprised by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20037)|
| 5:34:01| I feel like we were put in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20041)|
| 5:34:03| to be pitted between two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20043)|
| 5:34:07| And I feel like there's been some great collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20047)|
| 5:34:12| and some great issues brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20052)|
| 5:34:14| and I'm appreciative to both groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20054)|
| 5:34:15| to be willing to talk to those and bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20055)|
| 5:34:18| And I'm not sure why we would send a charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20058)|
| 5:34:22| that hasn't been fully vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20062)|
| 5:34:24| and isn't possibly the final needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20064)|
| 5:34:28| I agree with Councilwoman Fugett on her comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20068)|
| 5:34:31| about what is the magic number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20071)|
| 5:34:33| because we haven't had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20073)|
| 5:34:34| because we haven't had a workshop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20074)|
| 5:34:37| But there's a community working group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20077)|
| 5:34:40| that's gonna have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20080)|
| 5:34:41| to have more community representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20081)|
| 5:34:44| as well as stronger language and questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20084)|
| 5:34:47| that have been voted on in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20087)|
| 5:34:51| to have different seats at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20091)|
| 5:34:54| and take a broader look at who might be commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20094)|
| 5:34:58| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20098)|
| 5:34:59| And I feel like that there's another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20099)|
| 5:35:01| as you said, Councilwoman Fugett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20101)|
| 5:35:02| there's another bite at the apple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20102)|
| 5:35:04| and that working group should have input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20104)|
| 5:35:08| into what might be a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20108)|
| 5:35:10| So there's no reason to rush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20110)|
| 5:35:13| and give something that's half-baked as the charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20113)|
| 5:35:16| When we give folks something to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20116)|
| 5:35:19| it should be something that we're well vetted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20119)|
| 5:35:21| that we endorse and that they have had input into as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20121)|
| 5:35:26| And we have had collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20126)|
| 5:35:27| where that's gonna get recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20127)|
| 5:35:32| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20132)|
| 5:35:34| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20134)|
| 5:35:36| Yes, Mayor, I'd like to defer to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20136)|
| 5:35:40| and ask if he has had ample time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20140)|
| 5:35:43| to review what has been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20143)|
| 5:35:46| that we would be voting on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20146)|
| 5:35:51| Mr. Swanson, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20151)|
| 5:35:56| I have had the same amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20156)|
| 5:35:58| that you all have had to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20158)|
| 5:36:03| And it's been a very rushed process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20163)|
| 5:36:06| and it's been changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20166)|
| 5:36:07| It's been a moving target as we have moved along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20167)|
| 5:36:10| So I'm really not sure what it is I'm reviewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20170)|
| 5:36:14| but it's been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20174)|
| 5:36:16| And I frankly would like the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20176)|
| 5:36:20| to spend more adequate time reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20180)|
| 5:36:23| what is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20183)|
| 5:36:25| and thinking about all the potential consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20185)|
| 5:36:28| that could be associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20188)|
| 5:36:30| before we rushed into making a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20190)|
| 5:36:34| particularly in light of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20194)|
| 5:36:36| that the mayor has entered into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20196)|
| 5:36:43| that she would not do anything that would cause a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20203)|
| 5:36:47| for those who wish these changes in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20207)|
| 5:36:50| So I don't see any reason why you wouldn't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20210)|
| 5:36:53| as much time as you need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20213)|
| 5:36:56| to think the problem through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20216)|
| 5:36:56| rather than be unduly rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20216)|
| 5:36:58| And that's just my opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20218)|
| 5:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20221)|
| 5:37:02| And I would actually tend to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20222)|
| 5:37:07| that this entire process has felt rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20227)|
| 5:37:10| My concern is when we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20230)|
| 5:37:14| about making charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20234)|
| 5:37:15| I don't think that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20235)|
| 5:37:17| that we should take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20237)|
| 5:37:19| I do believe that we should have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20239)|
| 5:37:21| to do more due diligence as relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20241)|
| 5:37:25| And then also I'm really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20245)|
| 5:37:27| I keep hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20247)|
| 5:37:28| what are the potential unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20248)|
| 5:37:31| that maybe we're not even fully educated on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20251)|
| 5:37:34| at this particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20254)|
| 5:37:35| So to me, that's part of that due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20255)|
| 5:37:38| that makes me uncomfortable with the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20258)|
| 5:37:41| and the rushing of trying to get this pushed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20261)|
| 5:37:46| very quickly without us being able to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20266)|
| 5:37:49| in my opinion, that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20269)|
| 5:37:50| or I feel like I have not had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20270)|
| 5:37:52| to fully vet this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20272)|
| 5:37:53| It's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20273)|
| 5:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20275)|
| 5:37:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20277)|
| 5:37:59| Councilman Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20279)|
| 5:38:00| and then we'll go to Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20280)|
| 5:38:04| I'll echo a couple of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20284)|
| 5:38:06| and add another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20286)|
| 5:38:08| I think the process has moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20288)|
| 5:38:10| and it's been really hard to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20290)|
| 5:38:12| And I think in speaking with anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20292)|
| 5:38:15| that's served on a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20295)|
| 5:38:15| tech news or city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20295)|
| 5:38:17| or as mayor knows that it takes time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20297)|
| 5:38:20| to understand the dynamics associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20300)|
| 5:38:23| with governing the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20303)|
| 5:38:25| associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20305)|
| 5:38:26| And so I think the rapid pace of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20306)|
| 5:38:29| makes me uncomfortable with making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20309)|
| 5:38:31| such a substantial change of putting forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20311)|
| 5:38:34| a change or suggested change to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20314)|
| 5:38:38| I do think that a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20318)|
| 5:38:40| beyond a single workshop is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20320)|
| 5:38:43| to the extent it's a community advisory panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20323)|
| 5:38:45| to the extent it's three workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20325)|
| 5:38:47| I wanna understand the depths of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20327)|
| 5:38:50| associated with both of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20330)|
| 5:38:53| As it relates to board terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20333)|
| 5:38:56| I've thought about this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20336)|
| 5:38:59| I think reasonable people can disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20339)|
| 5:39:01| but I think it's highly subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20341)|
| 5:39:03| I think the term length of seven years sounds long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20343)|
| 5:39:07| but when you, given Councilmember Testerman's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20347)|
| 5:39:12| about the average tenure of a KUB commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20352)|
| 5:39:16| compared to others, the KUB knocks full as a head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20356)|
| 5:39:21| On the other hand, there's a need for fresh eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20361)|
| 5:39:24| and fresh input that I think shorter terms can help with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20364)|
| 5:39:28| I've been on, served in a number of boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20368)|
| 5:39:30| and I can guarantee you that if I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20370)|
| 5:39:33| any of the board members what the term length should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20373)|
| 5:39:35| there'd be some varying opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20375)|
| 5:39:36| So I think that there's a lot to be said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20376)|
| 5:39:40| for different perspectives on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20380)|
| 5:39:43| I think they're all reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20383)|
| 5:39:45| I just think it's highly subjective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20385)|
| 5:39:47| and I haven't heard a really strong argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20387)|
| 5:39:51| as to why changing the board terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20391)|
| 5:39:53| helps solve all the problems that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20393)|
| 5:39:56| we made a good dent in the resolution earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20396)|
| 5:40:00| Everything I heard over the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20400)|
| 5:40:03| I guess, 40 something hours of engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20403)|
| 5:40:05| with different people on this are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20405)|
| 5:40:08| how do we help those who have trouble paying their bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20408)|
| 5:40:11| And so how do we provide transparency, accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20411)|
| 5:40:16| and a public voice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20416)|
| 5:40:18| And I feel like the resolution earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20418)|
| 5:40:20| served Knoxville's residents really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20420)|
| 5:40:23| along those really material and practical items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20423)|
| 5:40:26| So I don't think I'll be supporting this amendment tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20426)|
| 5:40:33| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20433)|
| 5:40:35| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20435)|
| 5:40:39| Well, I had a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20439)|
| 5:40:42| One to answer Councilman Smith's question about board terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20442)|
| 5:40:47| Part of the reason to shorten board terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20447)|
| 5:40:52| is so that there may be a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20452)|
| 5:40:56| that that appointee is accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20456)|
| 5:41:01| to the same mayor for reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20461)|
| 5:41:04| So that holds them accountable a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20464)|
| 5:41:06| And if we built a culture of appointing seven year KUB terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20466)|
| 5:41:12| and not reappointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20472)|
| 5:41:15| that also removes accountability in some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20475)|
| 5:41:19| because there's an understanding that you get seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20479)|
| 5:41:26| and you shouldn't expect more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20486)|
| 5:41:28| And so there's no need to remain accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20488)|
| 5:41:34| to the mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20494)|
| 5:41:35| whether that is the current one or a future one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20495)|
| 5:41:40| in order to secure a reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20500)|
| 5:41:43| It's similar to our term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20503)|
| 5:41:46| While we are within our first term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20506)|
| 5:41:53| oftentimes elected officials are less bold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20513)|
| 5:41:56| in that first term and more bold in that second term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20516)|
| 5:41:59| when they're not up for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20519)|
| 5:42:01| So I would say it's an accountability piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20521)|
| 5:42:06| The other issue that I wanted to bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20526)|
| 5:42:10| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20530)|
| 5:42:15| Oh, one reason that I am supporting this charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20535)|
| 5:42:25| is because I know that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20545)|
| 5:42:28| wants to see more charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20548)|
| 5:42:31| We have lots to do as a city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20551)|
| 5:42:34| We're talking about what does public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20554)|
| 5:42:39| need to look like and what is the role of park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20559)|
| 5:42:41| need to look like within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20561)|
| 5:42:43| Changing park is a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20563)|
| 5:42:46| I think all of you all were very aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20566)|
| 5:42:49| with my frustrations through the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20569)|
| 5:42:51| There are many in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20571)|
| 5:42:53| who wanna change that budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20573)|
| 5:42:55| That's a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20575)|
| 5:42:57| There are several charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20577)|
| 5:42:58| that I hope to be a part of and bring before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20578)|
| 5:43:01| this city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20581)|
| 5:43:04| And I hope that we can continue the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20584)|
| 5:43:09| around KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20589)|
| 5:43:11| I think tonight, I would hope we've had enough discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20591)|
| 5:43:16| that there's support, at least for limiting the board terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20596)|
| 5:43:21| and we can continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20601)|
| 5:43:24| And if we decide that the four-year board term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20604)|
| 5:43:27| was not the board term that we wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20607)|
| 5:43:30| in two years, we can change that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20610)|
| 5:43:32| if the citizens vote in favor of shortening those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20612)|
| 5:43:37| So I do see this as an ongoing conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20617)|
| 5:43:41| and I hope that we can continue to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20621)|
| 5:43:46| And I hope that we can continue to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20626)|
| 5:43:50| So I do see this as an ongoing conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20630)|
| 5:43:54| and I hope to be, I just wanna emphasize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20634)|
| 5:43:57| I hope to be a part of more charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20637)|
| 5:43:59| that come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20639)|
| 5:44:02| So to help push along conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20642)|
| 5:44:05| I'd like to offer an amendment to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20645)|
| 5:44:12| removing references,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20652)|
| 5:44:20| to all issues other than board term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20660)|
| 5:44:26| And I can go through line by line and give those edits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20666)|
| 5:44:31| so that we're all clear on what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20671)|
| 5:44:35| But in the introduction, we would remove the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20675)|
| 5:44:38| between promote accountability and before enactment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20678)|
| 5:44:42| that huge paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20682)|
| 5:44:45| and we'd replace it with shortened commissioner terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20685)|
| 5:44:48| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20688)|
| 5:44:50| That would be the only focus of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20690)|
| 5:44:55| In section one, we would take out the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20695)|
| 5:45:01| set forth in the sections below R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20701)|
| 5:45:04| and we would insert the amendment set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20704)|
| 5:45:07| in section two below is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20707)|
| 5:45:10| We would take out section six and then insert section five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20710)|
| 5:45:16| and then down to the next section in section two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20716)|
| 5:45:20| this is of the actual amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20720)|
| 5:45:26| We would take out A, B and C and insert A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20726)|
| 5:45:33| And subsection A, we would take out December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20733)|
| 5:45:37| and insert January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20737)|
| 5:45:40| Also in that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20740)|
| 5:45:42| we would take out commissioner serving a first term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20742)|
| 5:45:46| on December 31st, 2020, that entire sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20746)|
| 5:45:51| We would also take out applications are submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20751)|
| 5:45:55| by the city to the city recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20755)|
| 5:45:59| We would strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20759)|
| 5:46:01| And instead we would insert the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20761)|
| 5:46:03| is required to be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20763)|
| 5:46:06| So simplifying that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20766)|
| 5:46:09| And then in subsection B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20769)|
| 5:46:13| we would strike the language from city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20773)|
| 5:46:18| all applications received all the way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20778)|
| 5:46:21| to select one name for nomination to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20781)|
| 5:46:26| remove that whole paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20786)|
| 5:46:29| And instead inserting the original language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20789)|
| 5:46:34| mayor has five or more nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20794)|
| 5:46:36| and the mayor shall have 45 days in which to select one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20796)|
| 5:46:39| or more for a nomination to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20799)|
| 5:46:48| We would also strike from that mayor shall have 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20808)|
| 5:46:52| from notice of disapproval in which to select a new nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20812)|
| 5:46:57| And we would insert board shall have 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20817)|
| 5:47:00| from notice of disapproval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20820)|
| 5:47:02| And we would insert board shall have 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20822)|
| 5:47:05| from notice of disapproval in which to submit five nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20825)|
| 5:47:10| or more, which may include the four nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20830)|
| 5:47:13| not previously selected by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20833)|
| 5:47:17| We would completely strike subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20837)|
| 5:47:26| And then we need to do some renumbering to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20846)|
| 5:47:30| we remove these sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20850)|
| 5:47:32| Section four now becomes section three, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20852)|
| 5:47:42| And then in section five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20862)|
| 5:47:43| we would need to strike that language once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20863)|
| 5:47:47| nomination of commissioners of KUV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20867)|
| 5:47:51| specifications for promoting public participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20871)|
| 5:47:56| transparency, and we would just leave it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20876)|
| 5:47:59| at commissioners of KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20879)|
| 5:48:03| And then the last thing to strike in section five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20883)|
| 5:48:11| would be the paragraph beginning with shall article 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20891)|
| 5:48:15| sections 1103, where it discusses the powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20895)|
| 5:48:21| that we have all the way through enactment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20901)|
| 5:48:27| And we would shorten that to insert shall article 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20907)|
| 5:48:31| section 1103 of the charter of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20911)|
| 5:48:34| entitled members of the board be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20914)|
| 5:48:37| so as to shorten commissioner terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20917)|
| 5:48:41| So it's taking out all other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20921)|
| 5:48:44| and only focusing on shortening commissioner terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20924)|
| 5:48:47| to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20927)|
| 5:48:50| And I believe that's the latest draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20930)|
| 5:48:54| that everyone has in their email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20934)|
| 5:48:56| which reduces it down to really just two paragraphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20936)|
| 5:49:03| Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20943)|
| 5:49:05| I never got an amended version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20945)|
| 5:49:07| So I certainly can't vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20947)|
| 5:49:09| that I can't read or interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20949)|
| 5:49:13| So again, I go back to just being pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20953)|
| 5:49:17| and being a makeshift and the game changes momentarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20957)|
| 5:49:23| So I never got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20963)|
| 5:49:26| So I can't really go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20966)|
| 5:49:31| Is there a second for the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20971)|
| 5:49:37| Mayor, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20977)|
| 5:49:40| Okay, is there any further discussion on this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20980)|
| 5:49:46| Ms. Testerman hasn't seen it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20986)|
| 5:49:49| Has anyone with our administration seen it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20989)|
| 5:49:53| Mayor, I've not seen it and kind of need that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20993)|
| 5:49:58| That's a very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=20998)|
| 5:50:00| And if someone from KUB wishes to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21000)|
| 5:50:04| I mean, this is amending the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21004)|
| 5:50:05| that affects an important part of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21005)|
| 5:50:13| So I was wondering if anyone with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21013)|
| 5:50:15| Has our council attorney seen it or who drafted it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21015)|
| 5:50:21| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21021)|
| 5:50:25| No, mayor, no council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21025)|
| 5:50:27| I have not seen it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21027)|
| 5:50:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21031)|
| 5:50:36| I've enabled Mr. Bolus to speak if he wishes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21036)|
| 5:50:39| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21039)|
| 5:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21041)|
| 5:50:42| I don't think anybody has seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21042)|
| 5:50:44| because Councilwoman Parker just came up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21044)|
| 5:50:47| I mean, the details of it, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21047)|
| 5:50:50| But anyway, I wanted just to go with how this all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21050)|
| 5:50:59| When people are saying that this came out of the blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21059)|
| 5:51:02| it did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21062)|
| 5:51:04| This conversation started many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21064)|
| 5:51:07| I became involved about a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21067)|
| 5:51:11| when I brought my KUB bill in when KUB was at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21071)|
| 5:51:16| The reason I brought it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21076)|
| 5:51:18| was that my basic fee was $80, $85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21078)|
| 5:51:23| My usage was $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21083)|
| 5:51:26| If I would have tripled, quadrupled the charges on my usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21086)|
| 5:51:32| it still wouldn't match the fee that I was being charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21092)|
| 5:51:36| just to have the service come into my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21096)|
| 5:51:40| So with knowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21100)|
| 5:51:42| it seems like the more energy I use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21102)|
| 5:51:45| the less I have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21105)|
| 5:51:49| It also seems if I was trying to save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21109)|
| 5:51:52| and turned off all my heat in the wintertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21112)|
| 5:51:56| just to save money, it really wouldn't help me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21116)|
| 5:52:00| So these are between the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21120)|
| 5:52:02| and not using up money that I might need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21122)|
| 5:52:06| for other basic needs got me really upset and concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21126)|
| 5:52:12| And I went to the KUB board and spoke with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21132)|
| 5:52:16| And there was nothing, there was no reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21136)|
| 5:52:23| Nothing was done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21143)|
| 5:52:25| And it came up several other times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21145)|
| 5:52:27| especially during the election over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21147)|
| 5:52:30| And I believe Mayor Kincaid made a lot of commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21150)|
| 5:52:34| to getting a low income person on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21154)|
| 5:52:37| and also identifying that fee as regressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21157)|
| 5:52:43| and saying Mayor that you were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21163)|
| 5:52:46| to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21166)|
| 5:52:49| Even this in the resolution to freeze it for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21169)|
| 5:52:55| that's not good enough either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21175)|
| 5:52:58| It's still regressive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21178)|
| 5:53:00| If anyone studies at all about flat fees or flat taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21180)|
| 5:53:05| it always, always hurts those with less, always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21185)|
| 5:53:09| So as far as bond ratings, that is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21189)|
| 5:53:13| That's very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21193)|
| 5:53:14| And I would love to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21194)|
| 5:53:17| At this point, where I am is we started with a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21197)|
| 5:53:23| I think eight items and it's been whittled down to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21203)|
| 5:53:28| And this happened, I think with SACE trying to go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21208)|
| 5:53:32| and make sure, well, what do you not want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21212)|
| 5:53:34| talking to the different council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21214)|
| 5:53:37| and trying to find something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21217)|
| 5:53:39| something that everybody would vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21219)|
| 5:53:41| And this is what we end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21221)|
| 5:53:46| At this moment, I don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21226)|
| 5:53:49| if I'm gonna vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21229)|
| 5:53:51| I don't like it, but I feel a commitment to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21231)|
| 5:53:56| to at least give us a first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21236)|
| 5:53:58| and then learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21238)|
| 5:54:00| And if I don't want it after that, I have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21240)|
| 5:54:03| But with as much voter suppression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21243)|
| 5:54:05| as what is going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21245)|
| 5:54:07| I'm not gonna be anywhere in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21247)|
| 5:54:11| I will listen, I will pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21251)|
| 5:54:13| and then make the decision with more knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21253)|
| 5:54:18| The only decision I have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21258)|
| 5:54:20| is if I want the voters to vote on it, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21260)|
| 5:54:24| The last thing I wanna say is I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21264)|
| 5:54:28| with Dave Bolus yesterday, it was a very nice phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21268)|
| 5:54:31| And he brought up, he gets frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21271)|
| 5:54:34| that KUB gets picked on all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21274)|
| 5:54:36| that they do a hundred things right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21276)|
| 5:54:38| and they only get criticized for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21278)|
| 5:54:40| And I do acknowledge KUB does a lot right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21280)|
| 5:54:45| I felt bad that Jerry Askew was taking any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21285)|
| 5:54:49| in any sort of personal way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21289)|
| 5:54:50| cause that's not at all how it's meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21290)|
| 5:54:53| It's meant that even though I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21293)|
| 5:54:56| that there are a lot of good intentions here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21296)|
| 5:54:59| this is definitely a blind spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21299)|
| 5:55:02| and it needs to be addressed somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21302)|
| 5:55:05| And I don't see that the resolution has been effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21305)|
| 5:55:10| would be effective in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21310)|
| 5:55:11| I don't know if the charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21311)|
| 5:55:13| would be effective in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21313)|
| 5:55:16| But I think I'm gonna hang on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21316)|
| 5:55:17| and give it an approval on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21317)|
| 5:55:21| so that all the options are open, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21321)|
| 5:55:25| Thank you, Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21325)|
| 5:55:29| I think I just have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21329)|
| 5:55:31| I mean, we've all been on for seven hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21331)|
| 5:55:35| and it's been a long agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21335)|
| 5:55:39| It's been great conversation on a lot of different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21339)|
| 5:55:42| but I got a bit of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21342)|
| 5:55:45| I mean, I think we're still very unclear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21345)|
| 5:55:48| about what it is we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21348)|
| 5:55:51| Again, the majority of us haven't even seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21351)|
| 5:55:55| haven't even seen what the latest version is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21355)|
| 5:56:01| but this is a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21361)|
| 5:56:03| And we're here on the fly trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21363)|
| 5:56:06| if we're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21366)|
| 5:56:10| We haven't even had a thorough workshop with more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21370)|
| 5:56:15| And I also go back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21375)|
| 5:56:17| I feel like this completely undermines the collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21377)|
| 5:56:22| of what the mayor and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21382)|
| 5:56:24| have worked hard to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21384)|
| 5:56:26| to listen to the proposals that SACE has brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21386)|
| 5:56:30| to talk to KUB, to come to some resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21390)|
| 5:56:35| And I think once this goes on a ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21395)|
| 5:56:39| again, at the zero hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21399)|
| 5:56:41| then it's going to be, in my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21401)|
| 5:56:45| a smear campaign against KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21405)|
| 5:56:48| and completely undo everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21408)|
| 5:56:54| that the administration and the mayor's tried to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21414)|
| 5:56:57| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21417)|
| 5:56:58| And I think, again, not really having all the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21418)|
| 5:57:02| it feels very forced, it feels very calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21422)|
| 5:57:08| So again, I mean, seven hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21428)|
| 5:57:11| and I just, I can't believe we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21431)|
| 5:57:15| you know, it's a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21435)|
| 5:57:16| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21436)|
| 5:57:18| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21438)|
| 5:57:20| I agree with some of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21440)|
| 5:57:22| that Councilwoman Parker brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21442)|
| 5:57:24| about accountability and terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21444)|
| 5:57:27| but I don't believe that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21447)|
| 5:57:29| a harried last minute charter change to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21449)|
| 5:57:33| I think we've made the point and we've made the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21453)|
| 5:57:36| We've had individual conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21456)|
| 5:57:39| I think two terms is a better plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21459)|
| 5:57:41| than one singular seven year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21461)|
| 5:57:43| I agree, but there's a community group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21463)|
| 5:57:47| that's gonna look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21467)|
| 5:57:48| and then they can say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21468)|
| 5:57:50| not just this one issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21470)|
| 5:57:52| that we're trying to boil it down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21472)|
| 5:57:54| When Councilwoman Singh just spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21474)|
| 5:57:56| this all started, and I remember we were on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21476)|
| 5:57:59| It was the previous council talking about fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21479)|
| 5:58:02| and rates and the burden on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21482)|
| 5:58:04| That's how these conversations started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21484)|
| 5:58:08| Let the working group look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21488)|
| 5:58:11| and come up with what a final charter change might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21491)|
| 5:58:20| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21500)|
| 5:58:21| Mr. Smith, did you have your hand up before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21501)|
| 5:58:25| I just wanted to address one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21505)|
| 5:58:29| as it relates to accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21509)|
| 5:58:30| and I agree with Councilwoman Ryder's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21510)|
| 5:58:34| in terms of letting the working group work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21514)|
| 5:58:37| I think even in this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21517)|
| 5:58:40| or in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21520)|
| 5:58:41| is the purpose of this is to promote accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21521)|
| 5:58:46| cost savings, and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21526)|
| 5:58:50| And the elements in the resolution earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21530)|
| 5:58:53| are all practical, real results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21533)|
| 5:58:57| that SACE and others have brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21537)|
| 5:59:02| and got the entire, this whole group agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21542)|
| 5:59:07| And that is a big change for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21547)|
| 5:59:11| As it relates to the board terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21551)|
| 5:59:12| I would just add one more item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21552)|
| 5:59:14| as it relates to accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21554)|
| 5:59:16| We're all accountable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21556)|
| 5:59:17| The mayor's accountable now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21557)|
| 5:59:19| and for appointing new board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21559)|
| 5:59:22| So to the extent accountability is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21562)|
| 5:59:25| as it relates to board terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21565)|
| 5:59:26| I think there's enough accountability built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21566)|
| 5:59:29| to all of us here to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21569)|
| 5:59:32| that those hard discussions are had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21572)|
| 5:59:34| about who needs to serve on the next KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21574)|
| 5:59:41| Yeah, and that's one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21581)|
| 5:59:42| The existing KUB board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21582)|
| 5:59:45| that we're trying to hold accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21585)|
| 5:59:47| are the ones that have agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21587)|
| 5:59:49| to everything in the resolution above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21589)|
| 5:59:53| I can't speak to their behavior in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21593)|
| 5:59:56| and I can't speak to the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21596)|
| 5:59:57| of perceived lack of attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21597)|
| 6:00:01| to low income rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21601)|
| 6:00:05| But I do know over the past 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21605)|
| 6:00:08| that same board has come to an agreement of seven things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21608)|
| 6:00:13| that are drastically better and more transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21613)|
| 6:00:17| and actual cost reductions for residents of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21617)|
| 6:00:21| So I guess I still land on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21621)|
| 6:00:24| I don't hear a convincing argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21624)|
| 6:00:27| about how changing board terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21627)|
| 6:00:31| solves transparency, reduces the cost burden, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21631)|
| 6:00:36| I'm not close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21636)|
| 6:00:37| I think that a working group is a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21637)|
| 6:00:40| to keep working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21640)|
| 6:00:42| But at this point, I haven't heard enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21642)|
| 6:00:45| about how one is a cause to resolve the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21645)|
| 6:00:50| So that was my last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21650)|
| 6:00:53| Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21653)|
| 6:00:54| I agree that the working group is going to be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21654)|
| 6:00:58| I also appreciate all the comments that people put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21658)|
| 6:01:05| I'm committed to working on these issues of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21665)|
| 6:01:08| and the burden and cost burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21668)|
| 6:01:10| And I think that the committee and the resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21670)|
| 6:01:13| and the strategies you all approved earlier this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21673)|
| 6:01:16| are a much better way to make progress on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21676)|
| 6:01:19| including in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21679)|
| 6:01:21| if there's a decision to change term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21681)|
| 6:01:23| to do so in a way that's more deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21683)|
| 6:01:26| Just a reminder, and then Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21686)|
| 6:01:29| I'll call on you that we have a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21689)|
| 6:01:32| to amend Ms. Parker's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21692)|
| 6:01:36| Councilman Roberto seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21696)|
| 6:01:38| That's what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21698)|
| 6:01:39| And Ms. Parker, if you have another comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21699)|
| 6:01:41| and then we can vote on that if you're all ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21701)|
| 6:01:46| I had a question for Steve Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21706)|
| 6:01:49| if he could join us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21709)|
| 6:01:50| because a lot of these questions that are being asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21710)|
| 6:01:54| we are trying to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21714)|
| 6:01:56| based on our perspective as council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21716)|
| 6:02:00| But I think Steve would have a better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21720)|
| 6:02:04| an easier job of sharing why the coalition thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21724)|
| 6:02:10| these were the changes needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21730)|
| 6:02:12| to bring about that accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21732)|
| 6:02:15| So if he's on the call, that will be amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21735)|
| 6:02:18| What exact question do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21738)|
| 6:02:21| Just, you just wanted to speak in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21741)|
| 6:02:24| or is there a question for Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21744)|
| 6:02:26| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21746)|
| 6:02:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21748)|
| 6:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21748)|
| 6:02:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21749)|
| 6:02:30| So thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21750)|
| 6:02:37| We, there are a number of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21757)|
| 6:02:40| that have been discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21760)|
| 6:02:42| We have been very pleased with the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21762)|
| 6:02:47| and the conversations that have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21767)|
| 6:02:49| I think they've been very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21769)|
| 6:02:51| We are supportive of the mayor's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21771)|
| 6:02:53| And I think that with the amendment that was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21773)|
| 6:02:57| to not make it mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21777)|
| 6:03:00| I think it is where we'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21780)|
| 6:03:05| The simple proposal to limit the board terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21785)|
| 6:03:11| and have it on a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21791)|
| 6:03:12| We have a workshop proposed for Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21792)|
| 6:03:16| So it was our hope that there would be a move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21796)|
| 6:03:21| to pass the narrow charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21801)|
| 6:03:25| that is for reducing the board terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21805)|
| 6:03:29| from seven years to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21809)|
| 6:03:32| And we believe that Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21812)|
| 6:03:35| much of this can be continued to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21815)|
| 6:03:38| because we were hoping that there would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21818)|
| 6:03:40| a workshop before this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21820)|
| 6:03:41| but it got postponed to after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21821)|
| 6:03:46| So we believe that there is a way to find common ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21826)|
| 6:03:51| between what the mayor's proposed and the term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21831)|
| 6:03:56| And we would think that having it go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21836)|
| 6:03:59| tonight on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21839)|
| 6:04:00| and then having the workshop on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21840)|
| 6:04:02| would be preferable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21842)|
| 6:04:05| But we also understand that there's some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21845)|
| 6:04:09| And again, I think there has been meaningful movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21849)|
| 6:04:14| and conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21854)|
| 6:04:16| but our preferred suggestion would be to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21856)|
| 6:04:21| a first reading tonight, attend the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21861)|
| 6:04:23| You will have another opportunity on the 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21863)|
| 6:04:28| to have a final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21868)|
| 6:04:30| It won't go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21870)|
| 6:04:32| The resolution would not go on without the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21872)|
| 6:04:36| And we would have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21876)|
| 6:04:37| to have the full throated discussion on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21877)|
| 6:04:41| which is currently scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21881)|
| 6:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21885)|
| 6:04:45| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21885)|
| 6:04:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21886)|
| 6:04:48| A while back, Mr. Bolas wanted to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21888)|
| 6:04:52| in regards to this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21892)|
| 6:04:53| So I would like him, if he's still available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21893)|
| 6:04:56| to speak to KUV's position about the amended amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21896)|
| 6:05:04| Mr. Bolas, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21904)|
| 6:05:09| Yes, I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21909)|
| 6:05:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21910)|
| 6:05:12| I want to say a few words real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21912)|
| 6:05:14| Obviously, we have not seen this amended amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21914)|
| 6:05:18| This is the, I think it was stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21918)|
| 6:05:19| this is the third change in a matter of three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21919)|
| 6:05:23| I think it's very interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21923)|
| 6:05:25| that we are accused of not being transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21925)|
| 6:05:27| yet our folks who are proposing this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21927)|
| 6:05:30| are like, have not reached out to me yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21930)|
| 6:05:33| and spoken to me directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21933)|
| 6:05:35| I will say also that the fact is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21935)|
| 6:05:39| low income does not always equal low usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21939)|
| 6:05:43| The facts are, there have been over 2,000 homes weatherized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21943)|
| 6:05:47| in Knoxville already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21947)|
| 6:05:49| All those were low income and high usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21949)|
| 6:05:51| The list is 3,000 more plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21951)|
| 6:05:54| and the list stopped because we just don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21954)|
| 6:05:57| to put folks on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21957)|
| 6:05:58| That list could be more thousands of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21958)|
| 6:06:01| all of which are low income and high utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21961)|
| 6:06:07| And so, that's some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21967)|
| 6:06:09| that haven't been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21969)|
| 6:06:10| that we're seeing with our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21970)|
| 6:06:13| I will say our board has passed more programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21973)|
| 6:06:18| to help those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21978)|
| 6:06:20| I can list off 10 or 15 off the top of my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21980)|
| 6:06:23| of things we're doing with toilet replacement programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21983)|
| 6:06:26| rounded up, things that we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21986)|
| 6:06:29| we're constantly looking for ways to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21989)|
| 6:06:31| So to say that we're not doing our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21991)|
| 6:06:33| insults our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21993)|
| 6:06:35| insults what we've been doing for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21995)|
| 6:06:37| And we are opposed to this rush of an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=21997)|
| 6:06:41| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22001)|
| 6:06:43| Give us a chance to do what's in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22003)|
| 6:06:45| that was passed earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22005)|

| 6:06:48| And if we don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22008)|
| 6:06:50| then we'll have a further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22010)|
| 6:06:52| about how we need to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22012)|
| 6:06:53| But that's what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22013)|

| 6:11:40| in the program to help build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22300)|

| 6:11:44| to encounter adverse interactions with police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22304)|

| 6:13:07| I thank you, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22387)|

| 6:13:45| Next person signed up for public forum is Sarah Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22425)|
| 6:13:49| Ms. Hawkins, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22429)|
| 6:13:53| She is, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22433)|
| 6:13:54| Yes, I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22434)|
| 6:13:55| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22435)|
| 6:13:56| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22436)|
| 6:13:57| Please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22437)|
| 6:13:59| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22439)|
| 6:14:02| It's Sarah Hawkins, 2018 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22442)|
| 6:14:06| I appreciate the marathon that all of you have been on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22446)|
| 6:14:12| and I appreciate your dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22452)|
| 6:14:15| This has been a very long meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22455)|
| 6:14:17| so I'm not gonna try and take up too much of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22457)|
| 6:14:20| The first thing I wanna say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22460)|
| 6:14:21| is probably gonna be a very unpopular opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22461)|
| 6:14:24| considering how long this meeting has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22464)|
| 6:14:26| but I would like to ask that the council re-evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22466)|
| 6:14:29| your rule about the number of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22469)|
| 6:14:31| who are allowed to speak on resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22471)|
| 6:14:34| during public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22474)|
| 6:14:36| Although some council members have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22476)|
| 6:14:39| collaborating with folks who live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22479)|
| 6:14:42| on lots of different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22482)|
| 6:14:43| it's not always easy to reach everybody on the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22483)|
| 6:14:46| whether by phone or email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22486)|
| 6:14:48| And as the previous speaker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22488)|
| 6:14:50| that's not necessarily anybody's fault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22490)|
| 6:14:52| but having the opportunity to speak to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22492)|
| 6:14:56| is the only way that some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22496)|
| 6:14:57| may have their perspective heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22497)|
| 6:15:01| Regarding this idea of requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22501)|
| 6:15:03| equal number of speakers for each side of a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22503)|
| 6:15:06| I also think that that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22506)|
| 6:15:08| that should be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22508)|
| 6:15:09| Whether a particular side has more speakers or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22509)|
| 6:15:13| is not always indicative of them having more support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22513)|
| 6:15:16| on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22516)|
| 6:15:17| And it is essential for everybody's voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22517)|
| 6:15:21| and in particular dissenting voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22521)|
| 6:15:24| on resolutions to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22524)|
| 6:15:27| As Councilwoman Parker said earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22527)|
| 6:15:29| the council meetings are not a debate stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22529)|
| 6:15:33| They are a forum for issues vital to the lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22533)|
| 6:15:36| of people who live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22536)|
| 6:15:39| And finally, before I leave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22539)|
| 6:15:41| I wanna ask to respectfully ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22541)|
| 6:15:46| that all of you please consider adopting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22546)|
| 6:15:49| person first language when speaking about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22549)|
| 6:15:54| Terms like the mentally ill and prostitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22554)|
| 6:15:58| are extremely outdated and offensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22558)|
| 6:16:00| to the people who live with those experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22560)|
| 6:16:04| Person first language is intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22564)|
| 6:16:06| to avoid dehumanization and marginalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22566)|
| 6:16:10| So instead of calling someone a diabetic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22570)|
| 6:16:12| we say a person with diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22572)|
| 6:16:15| Instead of saying schizophrenic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22575)|
| 6:16:18| we say a person with schizophrenia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22578)|
| 6:16:20| or a person living with mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22580)|
| 6:16:22| And please note that the term prostitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22582)|
| 6:16:25| has been replaced with the more appropriate language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22585)|
| 6:16:28| of sex worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22588)|
| 6:16:30| Again, this is called person first language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22590)|
| 6:16:33| And I know that your constituents would appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22593)|
| 6:16:36| you recognizing their humanity before identifying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22596)|
| 6:16:41| by their occupation or their housing status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22601)|
| 6:16:43| or their diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22603)|
| 6:16:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22604)|
| 6:16:45| And I hope everybody gets to sleep tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22605)|
| 6:16:51| Thank you, Ms. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22611)|
| 6:16:52| The next person signed up to speak is Amelia James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22612)|
| 6:16:57| Ms. James, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22617)|
| 6:16:59| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22619)|
| 6:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22620)|
| 6:17:02| You know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22622)|
| 6:17:03| Start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22623)|
| 6:17:05| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22625)|
| 6:17:07| Amelia James, 900 East Hill Ave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22627)|
| 6:17:12| Goodness, what a marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22632)|
| 6:17:15| I actually am really encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22635)|
| 6:17:17| by all the really constructive conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22637)|
| 6:17:19| that you all have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22639)|
| 6:17:20| So I'm glad everyone really stuck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22640)|
| 6:17:23| I'm glad everyone really stuck with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22643)|
| 6:17:26| particularly around the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22646)|
| 6:17:28| of the Helen Ross McNabb KPD response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22648)|
| 6:17:32| Obviously I was opposed to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22652)|
| 6:17:37| but many of you reassured me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22657)|
| 6:17:41| both in your individual conversations with me and tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22661)|
| 6:17:44| that even though you plan to vote yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22664)|
| 6:17:46| this is not the end of your efforts to reimagine policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22666)|
| 6:17:52| I really enjoyed what Councilperson Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22672)|
| 6:17:56| we won't throw cold water on the passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22676)|
| 6:17:59| And Councilperson Ryder said the word simultaneous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22679)|
| 6:18:03| that we can do simultaneous programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22683)|
| 6:18:07| So I'm looking forward to working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22687)|
| 6:18:08| with each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22688)|
| 6:18:10| as we do more to push for innovation and effective programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22690)|
| 6:18:15| I also wanna echo what Alex and Sarah have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22695)|
| 6:18:20| about allowing public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22700)|
| 6:18:24| The past several days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22704)|
| 6:18:25| I've spent really an excessive amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22705)|
| 6:18:28| trying to get in contact with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22708)|
| 6:18:30| And I know you all work jobs and have very busy lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22710)|
| 6:18:34| but I will say that Councilmembers Parker, Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22714)|
| 6:18:37| Ryder, Smith, and Thomas were the only ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22717)|
| 6:18:40| who either I was able to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22720)|
| 6:18:42| or made an attempt to get back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22722)|
| 6:18:45| And so I understand that it's really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22725)|
| 6:18:48| especially when things are brought very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22728)|
| 6:18:50| to talk to everyone who's trying to get in contact with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22730)|
| 6:18:53| especially if that's over a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22733)|
| 6:18:56| And that's why I think it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22736)|
| 6:18:58| for everyone to have a voice at City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22738)|
| 6:19:01| particularly before you cast a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22741)|
| 6:19:04| because sometimes there just aren't other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22744)|
| 6:19:06| So I do hope that you all consider changing those rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22746)|
| 6:19:11| and maybe considering how we even structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22751)|
| 6:19:14| City Council meetings and the length of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22754)|
| 6:19:19| I'm sure you all will have great ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22759)|
| 6:19:22| but I hope that we just continue to prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22762)|
| 6:19:25| community members' opportunities to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22765)|
| 6:19:28| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=22768)|
