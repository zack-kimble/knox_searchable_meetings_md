| 0:03:03| Before I get into my mayor's report, you all have noticed that we do have new microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| I would ask that at least for the foreseeable future that you continue to use your lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| and you can turn your microphones on and off as you've already figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| So they're supposed to be a little more sensitive, too, so you don't necessarily have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| quite as close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=202)|

| 0:04:30| home in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| It's a reminder that our first responders put their lives on the line every day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| this incident is a stark reminder of the sacrifices that they and their families make when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| take the oath to protect and serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=282)|

| 0:16:45| continued compliance of the Police Advisory and Review Committee with recent revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Council members, there's one person signed up to speak on this item, Ms. Everey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Constance, Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Yeah, as I've already expressed in the previous City Council meeting, this amendment is obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| directly coming from our state legislator, and it just shows how they played the long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| As I said before, America was never happy about police oversights from the public position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| particularly, and we know that they have been strategically choosing and placing administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| over the years to gut this particular policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| As I highlighted before, Elaine Davis, one of our very own from Knoxville, is the leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| of this particular initiative on the state legislator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And again, ironically, as we sit here and send our condolences to the families of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| police officers, we don't want to have anyone killed ever in our community, no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| the situation or circumstances is, but I am going to express the frustration of how all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| the heartfelt condolences have been outpoured, but I didn't see any of that when Lisa Edwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| was killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Lisa Edwards sent those heartfelt condolences to her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| We ain't brought Andy Thompson Jr.'s whole family in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Never heard those condolences outpoured from a few, I'll say a few you did, but the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| that I just watched and witnessed here sure didn't do that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Robert Bailey, I mean, like I said, I can run the names down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| So it's just ironic how you have this compassion when it's a cop, but when it's your own community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| constituents, taxpayers, and those individuals, we don't have that same mercy or concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| And that's the irony of what PARC was really created for, and yet to date, when you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| at it, behind Andre Stinson's murder and Scott Kofi, who's still employed by the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| department today, is one of those reasons why we even had PARC created, and you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| see PARC stepping up in that particular manner or that area to even bring the forces of compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| from the so-called administration that we just watched poured out for the cop, it still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| shows the concerns, and it still shows the tone deafness, and it still shows how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| all are still pro-police and only can show that concern when it's a cop, but when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| one of your members of your community, we still don't see that reciprocation in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| And so therefore, as far as expressing the frustration of it all, I am excited to announce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| that Justin Jones did file a lawsuit against Cameron Sexton, so hopefully we can get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| pushback on that particular initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| We can also shout out the federal government on putting McCarthy out of there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Shout out to those folks who made that initiative happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Maybe you all can take a clue and see how other legislative bodies are moving to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| that we have to start moving towards a particular thing that we need, which is accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| You know, it's ironic that KPD is quote-unquote getting this credit for backing the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Sheriff Department, but on the same night the cop was shot, they was running around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| the city harassing homeless people that were sleeping in their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| So my question is, KPD, was you supporting the Knox County Sheriff Department, or was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| you harassing the homeless people in our communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| I'm still trying to figure out what is Knoxville's vision, because we have not yet seen one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| and more importantly, I don't understand how India got re-elected by 9,000 voters who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| cannot explain the justifications of their vote in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| So with all that being said, the long story short comes down to is that PARC never really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| served a purpose in the first place, but the reality is that voters pay attention to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| they play the long game, and understand something, this was something that when they put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| thing together in 96, 97, they were planning on this in the years coming to gut this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| and it's the irony how voters, you put the right people in office so that they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Council, that concludes public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| There looked to be a typo in the resolution, or in the ordinance, I'm sorry, and so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| going to make a motion to amend the ordinance by striking out the word executive directory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| where that was supposed to say executive director, and so wherever we see executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| directory, I'm going to make a motion that we change that to executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| Okay, motion made to amend to fix that typo from directory to director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Seeing none, all those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| The motion to amend carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Are there any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I'm going to abstain from this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Motion carries seven ayes and two abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1278)|
| 0:21:29| 11A is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with CDM Smith Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| to provide professional engineering design services for the Old City Streetscapes Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| Phase 2, for an amount not to exceed $1,137,820.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| There's one person signed up to speak against this, Ms. Everey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| So the Streetscape Project is a concern because we still have not addressed the Magnolia Streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| nor have we addressed the Burlington Streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| We know that in India's previous administration, she actually moved money from those particular streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| to do other projects, particularly facing on the South Nassau Riverfront area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| And it's just ironic how the question has remained to date, what is the plan for the Magnolia and the Burlington Streetscape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| And to once again see new business jump in front of old business on our agenda and funding particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| it comes back to the concerns that we've been expressing when it comes to the black neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| especially how you all have continued to fail to fund us appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and address our concerns of the disenfranchisement over the years of the Nassau administration's previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| and currently have to just continue to ignore our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| When are we going to put money towards the Magnolia Streetscape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| We know that there was several black business contractors on those projects who were put on pause and even removed at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| And the key thing is that some of these businesses have been impacted so heavily, not just because of the lack of funding and contracting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| but we had COVID as well hit these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| And some of these businesses have unfortunately had to remodel their sales or even completely shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| And so once again, we are trying to understand why was the priority given to Broadway's area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| Old City's area particularly, over the East Nassau area that was in front of this initiative before it ever came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| I can probably guess, since it's in the Old City, I want to give a good shot that it has something to do with that baseball stadium, Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| But we're not going to say that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| It's more about how you all have been continuing to misappropriate and defund our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| but then at the same time want to pass resolutions for $100 million of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| And we ain't even seen a dime on that money yet either today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| So, again, Knoxville, when are you going to give black communities the funding we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| When are you going to come in on your promises that you made to our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| And more importantly, what is the vision of the Magnolia and Burlington Streetscape projects that were in front of the Old City project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| That concludes people signing up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Can we get an update on the other streetscapes projects that we have that are underway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| I'd be happy to share that with council members by email later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| We have a lot of streetscape projects going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I'm not prepared to give the update right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| We know that funding has been identified for the Burlington streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| Yes, in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Mr. Clabo, do you have a high-level overview of the other projects in addition to fielding questions about tonight's agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Okay, I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Tom Clabo, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Burlington is now in the right-of-way phase, so we're acquiring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| So once we get through that, we'll be letting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| It'll probably be the first of the next year when that's led to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Magnolia, that project is funded with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| And so we've finished phase one and two of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| We're working on phase three right now, and it's in the right-of-way phase as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Phase four and five takes that project up to Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| There are other streetscapes projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Are those the two main ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| Those are the only ones I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Well, Severe, the ongoing Severe streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| I appreciate that, because this is an issue that I have been following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| and I think it's important that we continue forward with especially the utility upgrades that come with the streetscapes projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1543)|
| 0:25:58| that helps with business development down our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| And so I'm just as interested as the public in seeing those move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| There are some landscaping issues that I do not am not in line with, but that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| But there are some critical infrastructure investments that are needed along those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| So I think it's really good to keep the public informed of where we are with those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Yes, just briefly, I also kind of had my eye on Burlington for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| I go way back to when Burlington actually had some more active businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| and the amount of potential in that area is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| The infrastructure in some ways is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| The building stock is underutilized, to say the least, but it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| So I think there's a lot of potential there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| and I look forward to seeing anything going forward in that area as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| I forgot to hit the light, just the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| And I just want to add that I think that the community will be very pleased with the progress that we're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| once we're able to get to that starting phase in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| So there's a lot of additional things that will be coming down the pike as it relates to Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| One of the things that, you know, I'm like you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Burlington has so much potential, but we do have some blighted properties there in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| and that was a conversation I had with Deputy Chief Brace earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| And so we'll be looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I think it is overdue as far as seeing some movement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| There's been a lot of discussion, and I think that folks will be very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| And so let's continue to ask those questions and stay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1678)|

| 0:28:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| 11C, Ms. Every is signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1736)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| So thank you all for acknowledging the Magnolia Umbrella Project, but there's some more projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I want to talk about in East Knoxville that seem to be taking a back burner to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| My next question is the Chihuly Park Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| What is the solution on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| We know it floods like the Nile River when it rains, and you can take your speedboat out there and jet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| some water if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| But then also, what's going on with the hotel project over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| You know, they dumped all the furniture out, made it seem like they were going to bring condominiums in overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| and yet that has paused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| What's up with the SunTrust building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| What was going on with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| There was supposed to be some promises made about the future of those buildings being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| And let's not forget, the old police station is supposed to have been turned over to the Clayton's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| and supposed to be a science museum that's coming in, but we have not heard an update to that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| So I'm going to continue to push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I see this money rolling out, but it's not coming to projects that were before it, and more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| no updates on what is happening with some of these projects that I just brought to the table once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| Now, India, for the record, if you don't know or are not prepared to share publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| then maybe you don't say anything and let these council members ask the people like this guy over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| the appropriate questions so we can get some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Because I'm asking you publicly and saying I'm giving an email out is not the answer to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| So I'm going to yield my time at this point, but I want to highlight that there are other projects again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| that was promised first to East Knoxville and we're not seeing the funding come down or update on those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| But I'm watching you all give money immediately towards other areas of the city that we know at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| has had multiple divestments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Broadway is well invested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| The issue with Broadway is that street, the way that those streets are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| We need to figure that traffic jam out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| But in reality, where does the funding come to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Where the blighted properties and the divestment has happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Where the black business and the black district business district doesn't exist anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| It's East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| So I'm going to continue to push on when are you all going to invest in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and into our neighborhoods and put some of these issues on the back burner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| because you already have promised us up front our funding and our needs first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| Mr. Roach has also signed up to speak on Item 11C in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| Once again, we have a situation where promises have been made for at least a couple of decades that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1876)|
| 0:31:27| And I'm going to speak off of what Ms. Every was saying earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| You know, promises made and promises unfulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| I won't say broken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| We've had all these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| I mean, the Broadway situation definitely has to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| Streetscape it, make it a boulevard, whatever, like you did Cumberland, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| But we have one particular geographical area in Knoxville that is still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1921)|
| 0:32:12| And that is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Literally from the, I guess, Harriet Tubman going east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| MLK, Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| We're waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| People are waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| South Knoxville's been squared away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| They're doing their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| West Knoxville's always had it going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| North Knoxville, Central, Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| East Knoxville had plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| There have been plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| There have been plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| What do we see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| And the one word that goes through all of this, because it was 25 years ago, we were hearing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| The one word that came out all the time was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| Potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Got so much potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Plans were laid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| People were asked within the community, what do you want to see happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| We got potential for not our money, but federal dollars coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| What do you want to see happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Instead, we saw, at the time, a semi-thriving, Councilman Thomas, a semi-thriving Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| a little business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| It died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| In that process, it died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Money was, I don't know what happened to the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Maybe somebody can do some serious research or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| But there's a systemic choking out of particular communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Those communities are populated primarily by people that look like me or at least have my skin tone or darker, a little bit lighter sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2046)|
| 0:34:16| And also, people who, like everybody else in Knoxville, trying to make a living, trying to do their thing, been law-abiding citizens, all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2056)|
| 0:34:33| But at the end of the day, we're left hanging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| People have been left hanging over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| And what's happened, and I'm going to say this so you all understand it clearly coming from my point of view, the key element is the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2084)|
| 0:34:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Because what's happened is you kind of spread out the indigenous black population of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| We've moved a little bit, connecting Mechanicsville to Lonsdale, the other indigenous black population center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| Okay, you spread us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| And we moved north a little bit, moved south a little bit, because people knew that's where you can get services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| That's where you can have a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| That's where you can have everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| The basic services that you find in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Figure that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| So now you want to, when we've got serious gentrification going on, now you want to talk about, yeah, let's get this show on the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2138)|
| 0:35:50| Mm-mm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| I'm telling Knoxville, don't be fooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Knoxville, don't be fooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Because it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| It's going to, people, there are going to be people losing, and I don't know how long they can put up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| I really don't know how long they can put up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Council members, that concludes people who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Mr. Clabo, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Why is the word streetscapes used in this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Because this is about the Broadway-Greenway connection from Fulton High School in both directions towards Edgewood, the library, and the thing, the First Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2185)|
| 0:36:38| So I feel like it's a little misleading and confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| And the project name came out of, we ended up getting a federal grant for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| And so in that process, it was titled Broadway streetscapes, and that carried forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| But it is, it's adjacent to Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| I know we had a lot of discussion about trying to move it away from the street, but it's really adjacent to the street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| It better have a buffer strip still between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Cool, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I was like, we're about to brawl about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| I just want, for the record, everybody to know that this is not a streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| This is a greenways project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| And I know this is something that Councilman Thomas has long been involved in, the greenway there, that we're trying to get connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| I think the Fulton part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| It doesn't have its greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Was that you, Mr. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| The greenway there took over 20 to 25 years to get completed there along the Fulton, and I'm not sure what some of the holdups there were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| and this is to continue making that connection so that we have a greenway that actually connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| and gets people in the city down places towards downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| and connects some of Councilman Thomas' and my district, Fountain City, all the way down to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| So I appreciate that we're slowly moving forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I know I've been talking about it since I've been on Council since 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| and I know Councilman Thomas was on the Greenways Commission, and so it goes way, way, way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Just a quick question, just kind of along those lines, just noticing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| I mean, it seems like, I don't want to say a small investment for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| but the completion date is not for another year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I was just curious sort of what the project timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| That just seemed like a long time to me, and maybe it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Right, and so this is an amendment to the design contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| so we want to carry that through the construction process, but it does have federal funds in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| so there's a rather lengthy process to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| We're still getting ready to enter into the right-of-way phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| so there's certification that goes through that, so it takes longer to develop those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| Working with you and hope to have a little bit more input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| I think probably the present plan is not optimum as what we had hoped for in earlier years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| but I understand the obstacles and the engineering difficulties of getting through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| and that's one reason why it's taken so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| but it's, of course, an important segment between Fulton High School and then the First Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| And then I also want to underline what Councilperson Ryder said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| This has been talked about and somewhat in a planning stage for well over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| and I remember talking about it and drawing up some preliminary plans back in the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2400)|
| 0:40:09| So this is a project that we've had to wait for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| And then just in context, the area that this will serve, including the Broadway Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| is let me say it's just a relatively low-income area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| This is going to serve some people that probably haven't been served very well in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| and we've had patients, but we're glad to see that this finally happening in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| And then I'll also make the point that that section of Broadway, by statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| is one of the most dangerous areas in the city as far as pedestrian fatalities and accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| This is an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| It's taken a long time, over 20 years, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| But sometimes we play the long game, and I'm glad to see us getting at least this far along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| And this doesn't mean that there's not other areas in town that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| that have been waiting just as long, and hopefully we can get to them soon too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| I'm curious about the Hall of Fame area that this is close to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2488)|
| 0:41:38| but I get a lot of questions about plans to make Hall of Fame more pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| Is that within the city's plans currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| or is the First Creek Greenway seen as the pedestrian access for that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2509)|
| 0:41:57| So there was a study, if you're talking about the connection of Hall of Fame to Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| there was a study, but there's no funding identified for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| So we did look at ways to make that more pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| I just want to circle back, speak a little bit about Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| and also want to recognize the fact that we have two people, one in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| who has made some major investment contributions in Burlington, which is Terry Kate Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| as well as Beverly Holland with her daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| And for those of us who can remember far back, when we think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| we had Jimmy Hoos there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| We had the fish market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| We had, I think it was, Frazier's had the barbecue drive-thru place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| But a lot of that business that was in Burlington historically was white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| And if we think about it, we actually have more black businesses now in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| with Lemmas, with the Elves, with State Burners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| but they are not going to be sustainable without all of us being intentional about patronizing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| networking with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Again, we've got so much potential in Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| but we want to make sure that we're keeping those businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| And so I'm just going to challenge everyone to please go through Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| and when you do, stop by the social gathering spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| They're now open for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| And let's be more intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Let's encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Cynthia Finch now has, she and Kira Wyatt also have service businesses that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| nonprofits helping in the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| But I'm excited for us to get started with Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| and see that movement and that redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| But when we think back historically, and a lot of us in the black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| we typically, because Burlington is really a black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| but historically it was a white community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| And through Urban Renewal, that is when we saw the great white flight out of Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| and black people started moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| And back then it wasn't popular to live next to black people in black communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| but we've seen that progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And, again, we just want to make sure that we're intentional about supporting not just the streetscape project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| but the businesses that are there that are going to make Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| and keep it with that cultural richness that we need in this city and in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2665)|

| 0:48:26| Nine ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| 11I is the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| To waive City of Knoxville taxes on Knox County surplus properties pursuant to Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| annotated sections 67-5-2507B5 and 67-5-2508D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Just, Mr. Evans, does the city get a portion of the sales amount that the county gets when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| they sell the surplus properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Out of the proceeds of the property that is sold, we get whatever our pro rata amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| is for taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| I'll give you a, for instance, on the last tax sale that was done, I think we ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2953)|
| 0:49:22| getting distributed to the city 604K and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| And the county got 300, right around 350K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| That was some time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| And it was because that's the way the taxes turned out percentage wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| We had about two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| The county had about one-third on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| So this may not be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| It might be a question for Mr. DeVos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| It might be a question for Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I'm not really sure who's going to answer me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| But properties sold through municipal or governmental tax sales have some title issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| That's the first part of my question before you launch into my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| So when a property goes through that, a lot of times we don't see them redeveloped because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| it's hard to get loans, construction monies, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| Are there some other ways that these properties can be put back into play so that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| become productive lots in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Because this entire list are city and county, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| These are the counties right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Yeah, but they're within the city bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| But they own them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| So the county owns them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Oh, so they're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| They're not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Why are they the county's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Because they went up for a delinquent tax sale sometime in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| The county was conducting the sale, as they often do, and they proffer the first bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| If no one outbids them, then they own the parcel that they just bid on, and that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| happened with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| So now they and we are wanting to waive the taxes owed so that they can be sold as surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3071)|
| 0:51:21| properties, not delinquent properties, but surplus properties, and then we can at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| recoup some of the taxes, both us and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| But the county owns them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| So what's the status of their title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| So David Brace, Chief of Staff for the Mayor, and I'll let my colleague, Mr. Swanson, jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| I'll give you the layperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| So oftentimes these properties go...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| They're very distressed, oftentimes do not have good title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Not every property, but many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| And sometimes they're not very buildable properties, so there's a whole mix of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| They go to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| The ones that don't sell essentially default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| The county and the city, when we do these, we put in the first bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Hopefully someone else will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| If not, they default to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Then we go back and try to dispose of them again in another sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Oftentimes these properties are distressed and you cannot get title insurance, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| does make it difficult to redevelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| So just know that we have multiple other tools, and I know that Mr. DeBose and Mr. Rosenberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| and Ms. Paul and others, we work daily on those other tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| One is the blight acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| I think there's a property on your agenda, which is a blight acquisition property where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| we essentially utilize blight eminent domain and pay the owner a fair market value, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| change title, clear title, and then we can dispose of it back into the market and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| it redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| We also have KCDC and our redevelopment tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| So again, a redevelopment area where you have distressed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Again, these are typically properties that aren't market viable because they can't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| title insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| And so KCDC is another tool within those redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| But the tax sale is a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| There are folks that can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Oftentimes they don't need to necessarily have bank financing, and they can go in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| redevelop, hold, and wait for that right of redemption period, and then go in and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| So it is one tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| These properties will probably be very distressed, and we occasionally have conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| people that perhaps watch the midnight infomercial about becoming wealthy with real estate, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| then they realize they can't go to the bank and get a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| And so sometimes they will recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| But our teams, both the city and the county, work together to try to identify properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| within specific redevelopment areas or distressed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| Sometimes they're flood-prone properties, so we can have our engineering team look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| So there's a comprehensive look, but it's just one tool of many to try to address distressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| So we've reviewed this list with engineering and other departments in the city before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| give the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Well, these are not county-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| But we've had the discussion that we don't need these for flood mitigation or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Our teams work together to try to identify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Again, this is the county tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| They have come forward with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| There are times that we will come forward and we work together with those two tax offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| But it is an area that Mayor Kincaiden has asked us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Are there ways for us to do a better job of identifying viable properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| Again, out of the total number of parcels in the city, it's a relatively small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| but they're an important small number that we're going to continue to look at ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| get those properties clear title and back into the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| That's the best thing that can happen is somebody get clear title and do something with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3281)|

| 0:54:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| How often do we waive the city taxes to be able to move properties from delinquent sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| to surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| There is a state statute that only allows us to do this when the property is upside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| down in terms of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| We would not have this tool as a way to get it back on the tax roll, but for the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| that the property is upside down and can't be sold in a profitable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| And so nobody wants to deal with it until they can deal with it in a profitable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| And so the state legislature gave us this tool to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| We can forgive up to a certain amount of taxes on these pieces of property so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| we can get them back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| And this is probably a process that doesn't happen as soon as a property is upside down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| but something that is checked into every couple of years or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| We have to spend some time trying to get them to go in the usual fashion, but when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| doesn't happen, then we can utilize this tool to get them back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3362)|

| 0:57:41| We have two people signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| First is Ms. Every and then Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3464)|
| 0:57:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| How much money have we given KPD in this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| In the millions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| No, for real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Like, it's been millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| And it's just ironic that at the same time, we still have issues with KPD that have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Ms. Belk is probably the top one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Still no justification on what happened to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| More importantly, the accountability of the people or individuals responsible for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| threats that she received via her email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| And then, you know, of course, the concerns we just had with some of the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| We had Philly Phelps and Andy Thompson Jr.'s case come across the courtrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| And of course, as the community, we're absolutely dissatisfied with the outcomes of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Hopefully, they'll pursue appeal processes that they can through the litigation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| with their lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| But the concern is that the members who were a part of these incidents are still employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| with KPD at the exact same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| And then more importantly, again, by data, we know that data shows that crime is driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| by poverty, which Knoxville, you have not addressed the poverty issue in the city at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| So I'm just curious at why we continue to fund KPD, but did not fund things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| the root causes of the issues that, quote unquote, KPD claims they address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| And I still cannot overlook the fact that a few weeks ago, we watched the hijacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| by Andrew over the Heart Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| And this looks like another setup kind of filling into that particular initiative of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| creating the drug court or the mental health court, which I want to call it, where you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| going to start forcing people into jail or into therapy, which is, of course, not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| appropriate process at all to help treat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| We know this from the medical professionals, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| They speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| And so I'm just continuing to point out, particularly to our taxpayers and those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| are in the homeless and housing crisis, especially when we have came to this podium numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| times and talked about how we can get innovative concepts and ideals to address these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| particular concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| And you all continue to dump money in everywhere but where we need it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| And so that's really the main concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| I know for a fact, by my count, if I'm keeping accurate with it, if you want to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| the violence interruption and all that all together, we're like around $5 million or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| in one month just to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| And the kicker is that KPD is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| There are racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| There is misogyny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| There is homophobia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| There is transphobia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| There is sexism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| There is multiple issues in this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| And you all literally keep dumping money into it, like as if it just does not matter at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| But then you want us to continue to trust these people in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| No wonder people are starting to shoot back, like literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| At some point, it breaks its back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Literally, it starts to break the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| And so, again, for all the housing folks who are here tonight, just continue to watch how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| to continue to dump the money, how you continue to bring your concerns, how to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| ignore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| But the kicker is we have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| And as I've already said on the campaign trail, it's not that we lack dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| We have poor allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| We have poor vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| And we have people who only serve the interests of their wants and not the best benefit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| the public needs and the public wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| And at that point, I will yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Do we have a Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3670)|
| 1:01:19| Would it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| I mean, the problem is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| To combat it, you need resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| We understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Why the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| And maybe someone can speak to that, please, and explain to the population of Knoxville why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3695)|
| 1:01:46| Metropolitan Drug Commission can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| Or wasn't a part of this request for funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3711)|
| 1:02:03| I'm simplistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I'll say it so you guys can take your shots where you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| We did a thing back a few years ago at the beginning of the present mayor's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3730)|
| 1:02:20| And it was discovered that the city was part of a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| And it had to do with people's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| But somehow, the data from that program, which was a guideline program that came from HHS all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| through the state, and every municipality in Tennessee had the option to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| the city of Knoxville chose to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| But most people in the city of Knoxville didn't know that the city was getting ready to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| But the data from that program was to be kept and administered only by the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3776)|
| 1:03:06| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Why not the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| Do your job within the lanes that you've been trained in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| I don't know what the capabilities right now of the police department are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| But to administer this type of program, the funding for it, is, I'm sorry, it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3807)|
| 1:03:41| It's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| So it doesn't make any sense to put another layer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| a burden layer on the police department for a program that has to do with people's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3829)|
| 1:03:58| literally their mental and physical health status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| And there are probably other non-profit organizations that could be brought into this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| and you would probably get a lot better results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| So y'all need to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Y'all need to ask them right now while you've got the chance to do that about what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Because if you don't, you're going to get called out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| Called out loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| Especially you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| Okay, Councilmembers, that concludes people who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| I just wanted to draw to your attention, if you hadn't had a chance to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Fiona McAnally sent an email out to you all just giving you some context about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| We've all heard a lot about the opioid settlement monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| the vast majority of which are going directly to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| and this grant application that is on your agenda tonight is what KPD is applying for out of that entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3907)|
| 1:05:15| None of that money has been distributed yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| and this is the first application coming from the city of Knoxville to those state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| And as you have seen in the AIS and as that email outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| if you all approve it and if this is awarded, it would provide staffing for a victim advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| to work with families that have lost members to overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| or someone who is experiencing substance misuse disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| It would help expand our co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| It would support efforts with drug take-back events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| support training on crisis intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| and support ongoing activities to stop drug-related criminal activity, including overdose deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| As a separate but related matter, the city of Knoxville will get some settlement monies from various sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| It's sort of a complicated, a lot of lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| and we've signed on as a party to many different lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| To date, we have received about $350,000 towards that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| and we expect to receive more over the next maybe 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| We don't know exactly how much, you know, all this stuff is pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| but I have assembled an internal team to help provide recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| for how the city will use the funds that are coming our way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| and obviously that will have members of KPD and KFD on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| also along with Charles Swanson and Fiona McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| I do want to say that that committee will be keeping in mind the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| that came out of the All for Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| That was a county-wide, community-wide process that the city has participated in consistently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| and I just want to take a minute to thank the police department and the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| who are on the front lines of the people who are facing drug overdoses all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| I know our police officers and firefighters are administering Narcan, saving lives all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| and also trying to direct people to treatment and other resources in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| through health departments and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| So just wanted to share that context, and we do plan to bring a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| for the monies that we do have aside from this that have come directly to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| to council for your review and approval before the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Thank you, Mayor, and I appreciated receiving the email from Ms. McAnally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| detailing the intention for the use of these funds were it to be awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| but I was disappointed because we have been having a conversation about various issues here at council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4091)|
| 1:08:22| and one of those being issues around substance use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| and what services are needed in our community to address these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| the 500 overdoses per year, 500 overdoses per year that our city is experiencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| that our first responders are experiencing and responding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| While we have ambulatory services that are not arriving on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| which then ties up our fire department's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| and they're not able to give the proper care that's needed in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| people are being lost because of that wait with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| And what I'm hearing from the community when it comes to overdoses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| is they're afraid to call 911 for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| They're afraid to call 911 for help because they want help to be sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| They want a medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| They want someone that can save their family member's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| but they don't want the police to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| And so we continue to see people die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| I mean, you know, we can take a hard-line approach to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| and say this is the service you get, deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| or we can respond to a crisis that we're seeing in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| and see if we can put a service in place that would save more lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| that would provide that service that our community needs and is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| I even struggle when I see the phrase substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| because I know so many people who have been prescribed medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| and taken it incorrectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| and had very severe health consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| and even there was the potential for death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| They weren't trying to be a drug user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| They weren't misusing drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| We have so many substances that people are relying on to just keep them alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4230)|
| 1:10:39| and if you take that wrong, that's an overdose that someone has to respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| and folks don't want to be treated as a criminal when they're fighting for their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| So it disappoints me that the conversation we've been having the last couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| about an alternative response team was not captured in this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| because it's so desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| It's not just about mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| It's not just about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| It's about all of these various issues, and we now have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| We have $350,000 we've been told about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| We have this $2 million grant that we're applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| We have the ability as a city to work with our community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| We're not going to do it on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| The county, if they stop talking about involuntary locking people up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| and other partners to provide new services for our community that is desperately needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| when we're experiencing over 500 overdose deaths per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| So I'm not able to support this proposal as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| but I would just encourage us to not work in disjointed ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4311)|
| 1:12:01| but let's pull these conversations together because I think there's a lot of overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| There's a lot of synergy, and I think our proposals will be stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| when it reflects all of these conversations that we're having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| when we include these innovative strategies that are being lifted up by our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| Yeah, so Ms. McAnally or maybe someone in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| so a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| The counties in the state were given disbursements earlier in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| according to what I find from the Tennessee Opioid Abatement Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| Looks like Knox County was third, got the third most amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| They got over $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Do we know anything about how Knox County uses or plans to use their $2.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4379)|
| 1:13:07| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Fiona McAnally, Director of Government Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| I can't say that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Yes, the county and state are receiving the bulk of the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| from many of these lawsuit settlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| The county is still working through their process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| but they hope to have something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| and we're coordinating with them by the end of the year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| Okay, so they are getting this $2.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| but they haven't put into play the template of how they're going to use the funding for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| Correct. It's a pretty broad umbrella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| so everyone wants to make sure these funds are used wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Okay. Who's at the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| I mean, are we trying to get an additional $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and they have $2.5 million, and it partners together to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Who's part of that conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| Well, it's probably going to be separate processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| The county will have theirs, the city will have theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| but we are working together and talking about how that process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| making sure we're reaching the largest amount of organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| but also the money can be used for internal programs as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| like the county, I don't have a clue what they're planning on doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| but they may choose to use some of that money at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| You know, there's lots of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Okay, so I can talk to my county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| and get more info on how they are talking about using their $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| Yeah, but we are in conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| Okay, okay. I would love to have more details about what they're thinking about or planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| because we don't have that piece of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| So the information from you is that the agenda item is to request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| through a grant process, $2 million, and we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| KPD is who put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| They have a grants writer in-house as part of the KPD team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| And the list of stuff that you gave us is providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| are these the things that are going into the grant application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| what you provided us in the email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Yes, I'll defer to KPD to answer more details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Deputy Chief Powell is here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| Deputy Chief Powell, so what I have so far is provide staffing for a victim advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| to work with families that have lost a member to overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| or a loved one who experiences substance abuse disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| Where does that victim advocate work at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| So it would be in the overdose investigative unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| Currently right now, and referring back to Ms. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| you have 511 suspected overdoses in Occoquan County last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| There is numerous amounts of calls coming in for loved families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| wanting to know what the status is on the case of their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| to the point that it's overwhelming the department there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| So that's what that advocate would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| So follow-up after the overdose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| And then support efforts with drug take-back events, how do those work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| So that typically works with the Metropolitan Drug Committee and the DEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| We just did one in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| We took back 330 pounds of medicines, unused prescriptions through like a Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4587)|
| 1:16:37| I think the one in April was in Kroger parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| So we would like to do more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| It takes manpower to bring the traffic in, to get the drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| and to get people out safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| So it's a very heavy manpower type of task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| And then one of the other items that's going into the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| is support training on crisis intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Who are we training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Who's doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| The crisis intervention team, there's training there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| There's training all the way across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Identifying drug traffickers is what we're really wanting to get more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| There was a broad amount of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| and these are just the base top hits that we listed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| I just want to say I'm very passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| So what we did, we sat down with all of the frontline officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| that's having to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| and we said what can you need to better outfit you with tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| to fight these overdoses and these traffickers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| And so we came up with a list, and these are the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| The biggest thing was the advocate was a huge process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| The take backs, improve our capabilities of investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| I mean there is a ton of investigative hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| that is put into each and every one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| So this money would go towards helping with those man hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| My time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| The Tennessee Opioid Abatement Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| I think they have $40 million right now that they're distributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| And the date for the grant end is the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| So it's something that I know a lot of different agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| the city's doing one grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| but there are tons and tons of other grants being submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| and some innovative programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| I would love to see it go towards an alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| but I also know McNab is working through Department of Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| I think, on a grant to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| So that has not been forgotten or dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Yeah, this is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| If there are some innovative ideas on how to work on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| please apply for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| They're letting you be very creative with the solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| Turn on your mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| For Ms. McNally, the $2 million that's being applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| and I understand the criteria that was used to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Once we receive it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| is there any flexibility about how we can use it outside the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| department if we chose to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I'm not saying that that would necessarily be the best thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| but how much flexibility would there be on how we spend it once we got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| Well, I'm not part of that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| I would assume you have to spend it on what you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| But that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| there probably will be additional waves of funding from the State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Abatement Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Council Member Thomas, just to add on to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| the police department took the initiative to apply for this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| and they are a big part of what the city of Knoxville's focus is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| and they're not the only tool or way we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| It's not just law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| We all know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| and this council's been very passionate about supporting alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| approaches and treating addiction as a health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| I think as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| as we have learned that the monies that we do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| the $2 million we don't have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| We don't know if we'll get it, or if we get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| we might get less than what we applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| But we do know that we have a little bit of money coming directly to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| The law department and Ms. McAnally and the other members of our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| are studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| They're not unrestricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| You can't just use it just for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| It can't just be for mental health writ large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| So we're examining what the rules are for how we can use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| and then going to come back to council with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| We are also going to be working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| talking to our county partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| They have a health department that serves the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| and that health department has a harm reduction division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| or group of people that works on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| So this KPD grant is just one aspect of strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| and we are just trying to work through what we can and can't do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| funds that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And also just want to remind council that we have used community agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| grants and other contracts to support the many community agencies that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| working on this, Positively Living, MCNAB, Metro Drug Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| Next Step Initiative, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| And so we want to see if that's one way we can use the money that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| directly to the city that isn't something we have to apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Mr. Swanson, you look like you have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| No, I would just say that this is a particular pot of money from these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| class action lawsuits that goes directly to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| and the state has created, through legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| a committee to determine who gets those funds and under what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| circumstances, and you apply to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| The state legislature has appointed the committee that reviews these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| applications, and that committee will decide who gets what amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| if any, but when they do that, you will be limited to what you apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| with regard to those particular funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| That is a different situation than we are a plaintiff ourselves in a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| of these actions, and we are receiving some funds as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| The $350,000 we've got now, there's more coming, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| probably before the end of the year, at least another $450,000 or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| will come to the city, and we'll have those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| And those are the particular funds where we have some more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| with how we use those funds, and we're looking to make connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| with our partners who will help us work together to create, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| some innovative programs for utilizing those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| but it's still going to have to be for abatement of the opioid crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| and for dealing with future problems related to the opioid crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| We can't redirect those funds to another purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| It's got to be related to the opioid crisis, and there is management of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| There is oversight of that from those who manage those settlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| And so there's not complete flexibility, but there is some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| with regard to doing some innovative programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| that will deal with the opioid situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| If I may respond there, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| I was wanting kind of just clarification and nuts and bolts explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| and that was a really good overview, and I applaud KPD for making this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5060)|
| 1:24:28| Basically, I was kind of trying to get an idea of how much flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| I hope they get it, and, of course, as the mayor said and you just outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| this doesn't keep the city or other agencies from applying as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| and applying these funds to certain areas that can help according to the way they see fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| and some with more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Basically a good nuts and bolts explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| That's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Seeing no lights on, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5109)|
| 1:25:18| 11M is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a fourth amendment to contract C-21-0296| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| with Messer Construction Company to modify the scope of work for the real-time information center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| at the new public safety complex, increasing the contract price by $24,874| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| for a total contract price not to exceed $53,000, excuse me, $53,460,574.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5136)|
| 1:25:46| Motion made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| If there is, one person signed up to speak to this item, Ms. Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5150)|
| 1:26:05| Again, just continue to raise the concerns about the money that we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| And again, as far as this real-time information center, I feel like this has already been something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| we have brought to the floor a few times in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| And again, still no real clarification on what exactly is this information center doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| What type of data are they collecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| What is the purpose of the data that's been collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| What will it be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| How are we actually doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Is it a form of crime prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Is it a catalog of potential suspects or predators or assailants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| And more importantly, what is the operational purpose of having this information center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| up and running in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| We have yet to have transparency on the necessity of even such an infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| Are we doing it to collect information for ICE and immigrants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Are we using it for the Detroit 311 and the drug trafficking drug line that's been coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| through Michigan to Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Are we using it for something more local right here in Knoxville and trying to reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| it to potential gang members or gang affiliations and associates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| I just don't understand why we have all this new surveillance equipment seeming to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| to pop up, especially since Paul Noel has been brought into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| And more importantly, the lack of transparency on its uses and purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| As I've already highlighted before, we have this security thing online that I brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| up about the child predators and Paul echoed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Okay, that's one thing, but do we need point million plus dollars to do surveillance online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| of child predators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| And then more importantly, again, who is holding this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Where is this information going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Are you the council members going to have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Is it going up to the state legislator and Bill Lee and his people hold this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Or is it going all the way up to the federal office and the president and those chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| members will have access to the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Or is it just strictly on a local basis with Knox County Sheriff KPD and TBI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| Is it just going to David Roush desk as far as it goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| We need to know what you all are doing with this equipment, and more importantly, its purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| objectives, and goals, and who are the potential people of target or interest that you're even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| using the information for or the surveillance equipment for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Again, I don't see how this has been an impact to crime prevention, particularly in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| I don't see it solving murders in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| I don't see it preventing gun violence or social media bullying online in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| I can run through numerous things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| I don't see it actively doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| I mean, we have multiple issues in our homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| We don't talk about the homeless death and the homeless murder and the homeless killing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| I haven't seen it do any references in that space in addressing those issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| So I'm just trying to really understand other than creating some type of potential cop city level interest in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| What is the purpose of funding these type of initiatives on taxpayers dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| That's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Why are taxpayers paying for this type of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| We're not interested in this type of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| We told you what our concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| We want to address the poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| We want to address the lack of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| We want to address our housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| We want you to bring a crisis response like heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| We want you to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| And yet every time I look up, there is a way that you are continuing to filter funding into KPD, who has, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| numerous issues, numerous problems and numerous concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| You know, it's ironic when we talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| I forgot to bring that up, but I'll bring it up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| We are police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5358)|

| 1:29:21| I cannot forget that mother and her children who put herself in a bathroom because her psychotic husband was having an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| episode in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| And guess what he worked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| So I can't forget the kid who was stopped at the school, accused of smelling like marijuana and was assaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| Only we found out that only we have marijuana, but even questioned if it was such a call of smell of odor on him in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| And so, again, why are we giving this department any kind of funding when we don't have accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| It is a rude department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| We have all these unmarked cop cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Is that what y'all been spending the money on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Because every time I look up, I see a black Chrysler flashing with blue and red lights on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| I'm like, why do we have a Chrysler 300 of the newest grade model 2023 zooming down our streets with an unmarked car and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| undercover cop in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Explain to me the purpose of that, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| I can't understand why you all continue, as I said before, fund this department with zero accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| Your department is rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| You all didn't have control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| And y'all talk about lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Well, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| I think there's going to be plenty more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| So maybe you do need the money so you can help cover that cost when it comes down the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| Councilmember, that concludes people signing up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Deputy Chief Powell is here to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| This is the Fourth Amendment of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Can this be expected to be the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Can somebody provide an update on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| Yeah, I'll jump in really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| Yes, so if you'll remember, this was the Fourth Amendment to the Messer Contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| So that was the original public safety project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| That's had a few amendments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| This was actually a separately funded project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| So in the fiscal year of 22-23, Council approved in the budget $1.522 million for the Real-Time Information Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5459)|
| 1:31:09| So the contract actually do the nuts and bolts, the sheetrock and the electrical and the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| That contract was $1,133,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| So we extended above our contingency $24,874.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| So we've got to do this final change order to wrap up this project, and it should be the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| But it's very specific, again, to this Real-Time Crime Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| My second question is on the administrative policy or rules associated with the Real-Time Crime Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| I think the last time we had this conversation, those weren't developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Have those been developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| No, sir, they have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| We're still working on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| A lot of that will depend or work around the software that we would put in the actual Real-Time Information Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5511)|
| 1:31:58| So we're working with, again, I think I stated last time, Oklahoma, New Orleans, Atlanta, and Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5518)|
| 1:32:07| But, again, they're all different software, so a lot of that will drive the software that we purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| Have we selected the software?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| No, sir, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| We'll go through an RFP with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| And so once the software is selected, then the administrative rules will be determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| The administrative rules will be determined before it stands up, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5548)|

| 1:33:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| There are two people signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| First is Mr. Zieda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| If you come to the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| I am back again over the Bilo store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| What Mr. Avery said about the police department is partially true, if not entirely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5622)|
| 1:33:52| I know between the police department and the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| nobody could imagine burning a store, police department writing a report that the fire department burned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5637)|
| 1:34:07| coroner and the funeral department or agency or whatever you may call it, and then a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5647)|
| 1:34:18| And I can prove it, and everybody here that knows the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| well, I forgot the numbers, what they are of that incident, will know that I'm telling it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| But I'm here to discuss the clinic, the abortion clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| When a person dies, their plot usually takes over a year until the grass grows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5676)|
| 1:34:44| Now, the FBI and the fire department state that Mr. Reno burned the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5684)|
| 1:34:54| I say the suspect is sitting right there, Daryl Whitaker, which I know this is probably Stan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5694)|
| 1:35:02| But Daryl Whitaker, the arsonist, the arson investigator, chances are strong all that anybody has to do over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5702)|
| 1:35:12| is pick up the by-law arson pictures of that store fire, and you'll see how I come up to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5712)|
| 1:35:22| Now, we've got a person that's been dead here about a year since February 2022, and that plot, the grass has not grown yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5722)|
| 1:35:32| Mr. Reno, his plot is fully engulfed in grass, just like the rest of the people that are over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5732)|
| 1:35:44| Chances are strong the government, all they did was put the tombstone in that plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5744)|
| 1:35:53| If you doubt what I'm saying, which I don't blame you, it is hard to believe what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| Just ask the fire department to release the arson pictures of this clinic, and let's decide if I'm right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5761)|
| 1:36:10| And about the by-law, we all know I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5770)|
| 1:36:18| This time I will leave without arguing or cause a fit. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| But before I go, do we have an agreement to have these pictures released from the arson investigators? Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5784)|
| 1:36:34| I mean, the man's dead. You can't prosecute him, so why withhold the pictures? Let us take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5794)|
| 1:36:46| Am I right or wrong? Am I right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| That's a $2 million project, and not a stone was put up, not a rock, nothing other than a fence around that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5811)|
| 1:37:00| Nothing but a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| I requested the pictures from the fire department. They stated they cannot release the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| Sooner or later, we will see them. We will see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| Doubt what I'm talking about? Take a look at by-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| I believe the incident number is 12-048777.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| Take a look at that store and see the police department, the fire department, and the coroner, and the funeral, and the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5853)|
| 1:37:46| and see what they can accomplish when they get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| Unbelievable. India McDowell was blamed for that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| Nobody burned it but the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Now, thank you. I know last time I left in a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| This time we'll leave a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Sooner or later, this time next year, I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| I want to see those pictures. I want to see them. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| Thank you. The last person standing up to speak at public forum is Rick Roach. Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5894)|
| 1:38:25| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Once again, we're going through city council meetings and a lot of money is flowing, whether it's coming from or being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5906)|
| 1:38:37| Let's go with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| And eventually, when that money hits the city, there's no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5920)|
| 1:38:50| And we've got to start being a little bit more responsible, dare I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5930)|
| 1:39:02| David, I want to address something that you said about the tax, the arrangement between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5942)|
| 1:39:15| Okay, everybody knows we've got property taxes for the city, we've got property taxes for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| Unfortunately, I went through a situation, tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| And going through that process, I actually ended up conversing with David about what the possibility was of proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231003?start=5965)|
