| 0:06:00| This order does not in any way limit quorum, meeting notice or voting requirements of the committee does not limit preempt or repeal any local government permitting public comment during meetings except that compliance with such requirements may be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=360)|
| 0:06:16| By allowing timely and appropriately submitted comments to be read into the record by a member of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=376)|
| 0:06:25| And that is the essence of executive order 6.5 that was proposed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| Do we make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=392)|

| 0:08:09| Our next order of business is an update on the Ethics Committee from the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| I want to squill some rumors right now. There's no vote today to do away with the Ethics Committee. Got a phone call 2 or 3 times and this is not what this is about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=497)|
| 0:08:28| This is just an update on the Ethics Committee, and we will look, if this committee feels like we need to go forward after today, we can present it to the chair and see what the chair says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=508)|
| 0:08:39| So, today is just an informative update on the Ethics Committee. So, you're up, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=519)|
| 0:08:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I'm not expressing an opinion one way or the other. I'm just going to give you the facts, what the law says, and what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| The opinions would be a policy matter for this committee and ultimately for Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| So, I've sent out to all of you a memorandum that basically sums up everything that with regard to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| ethics code in a committee. In summary, I'll go back through it. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| state law required that all governing bodies, municipalities, and counties come up with an ethics code. This was in response to what many of you may be too young to remember, but it was the Tennessee Waltz that happened over in West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=560)|
| 0:09:37| It kind of what Tennessee Waltz scandal had been investigated by TBI and FBI, and it put some people in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| And after that, the legislature came up with the requirement for all governing bodies, municipalities, and counties to come up with an ethics code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=585)|
| 0:09:55| The essence of the ethics code was to set forth certain ethical things that elected people and personnel and employees had to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=595)|
| 0:10:07| And the legislature charged CTAS, which is the County Technical Advisory Service, UT, and MTAS for the cities to come up with a model code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=607)|
| 0:10:22| They came up with different model codes, the difference being that they both had the factors that the legislature required is what had to be in an ethics code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=622)|
| 0:10:34| The thou shalt not do this, thou shalt not do that. That's what they had. And basically, it had to do with gifts and using your influence, excuse me, had to do with nepotism and those things which you're acquainted with that are in the Knox County, excuse me, ethics code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=634)|
| 0:10:54| What the County Technical Advisory Service put in was, and this was optional, and it's discretionary by any county body, and that is having an ethics committee to hear complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=654)|
| 0:11:09| And in the municipal code, such as the city of Knoxville has, and I was acquainted with it because I was the city attorney for the town of Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=669)|
| 0:11:21| It just had the code, the thou shalt not. It met the basic requirements of the statute. It did not have an ethics committee to hear anything that was a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=681)|
| 0:11:34| So, in compliance with the one that Knox County adopted back in 2007, they established the ethics committee of which we've had, there's nine members on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=694)|
| 0:11:49| It tells how they're picked and tells their term of their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| It's kind of a redundant thing because everything starts, let's go with the municipal one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| The municipal one says that all complaints or anything with regard to ethics goes to the city law director. In that case, in Knoxville, it would be Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=721)|
| 0:12:11| He won't investigate. If he determines from the investigation that there is some potential violation, he sends it, if it's a criminal act, he sends it on to Charm Allen, or at that point, it was Randy Nichols, the DA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=731)|
| 0:12:27| And if it's something within the structure of the executive branch, he would send it on to the head of that department and say, you need to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=747)|
| 0:12:39| So, that's the way that happened. And then we have the same thing in ours where the law director gets the initial complaint. He evaluates it to see if there's any merit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=759)|
| 0:12:51| And it states in there the basis of which the law director will determine whether there's merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| Basically, what happened, though, in the eight years and six, seven months I've been on there on the ethics committee that I've been working for the law department, we've had, I don't know, I think, Carson Daly, you got from Rhonda a list of the complaints that you got a list of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=778)|
| 0:13:24| Several of them were just knocked out. At some point when I would determine that there wasn't anything there, the political thing, or there weren't any facts that weren't hearsay, I would just send it on, not cause any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=804)|
| 0:13:41| Because as put in the head of my ethics committee thing, the Supreme Court of the United States has said everybody's got a right, a good name. That's a constitutional right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=821)|
| 0:13:54| And what I was seeing happen was if something was filed, the newspaper would pick it up and there'd be a headline, Hondo accused of violating ethics, even if there was nothing to do with it, nothing hearsay or it was a political thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=834)|
| 0:14:12| And just getting the paper that was being violated, in my opinion, would be a violation of that constitutional right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=852)|
| 0:14:23| But when I was evaluating, one of the local bloggers started to raise claims, didn't have authority to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=863)|
| 0:14:38| And therefore, all these things which are public record, once they're filed, they're public record, had to go automatically to the ethics committee, which then dropped the name up again, of innocent people, potentially innocent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=878)|
| 0:14:54| And I would point out we've had no, in my half year, there's nobody that violated the ethics code on anything that's come before the, or been filed or come before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=894)|
| 0:15:08| Now, moving on, the ethics committee then is charged with looking at this and having a quasi-judicial hearing, in which they determine the guilt or innocence of that particular person who's been accused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=908)|
| 0:15:22| So that particular person, if he comes in, as was the case with Bob Thomas and Charlie Bustler, right in the middle of their campaign for the Republican nomination in 20, what was that, 20, I lost track of time now, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=922)|
| 0:15:42| And had to sit there with the press looking at them and being accused once again in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=942)|
| 0:15:51| The ethics committee had a long, involved hearing in which Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bustler had to get and pay for counsel to represent them, totally debunked the accusations made by Mr. Bo Bennett against them and found them to be not guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=951)|
| 0:16:12| So that went on, but then also during that period, there were allegations made against two other candidates, which had absolutely no substance at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=972)|
| 0:16:24| One against Lee Trammell, running for sheriff, and another against Commissioner Anders, yeah, thank you, Commissioner Anders, who was running for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=984)|
| 0:16:40| Of course, that got in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Now, whether that had any effect or anything on the election, I don't know, but as you well know, the mayoral election was decided by something like 24 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1002)|
| 0:16:52| Personally, my only opinion was that that was ill brought and it shouldn't have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| There's no opinion on whether the ethics committee should meet or should not meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| The ethics committee rightly found the right answer, that there was no, there was nothing to that allegation, but the fact was they had to undergo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1024)|
| 0:17:14| So in my eight years and eight months or six or whatever it is I've been on there, we've only had two hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| Well, actually only one hearing, excuse me, that one hearing had both, it was a combined hearing with both Bustler and Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| And that's the only hearing we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| And going back, I think the only other hearing that actually was before the ethics committee was back in 2010, I believe, and it was an allegation against Mike Arms and Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1053)|
| 0:17:49| And then there was another one against whoever was the chairman of the commission at that time with regard to the Black Wednesday thing, but that went to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1069)|
| 0:18:02| So any court proceeding holds everything to do with the ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| Well, that's basically where the ethics thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Keeping in mind that there are two parts to our ethics, and one is the ethics committee, which you're dealing with, and the other is the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1091)|
| 0:18:20| It's easy enough if this committee, if the commission wants to do it, to simply go with the code part of it, and there's no compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| If this committee and the commission want to continue with the ethics committee, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| It's a choice of commission on which way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Additionally, we did amend the code because in 2005, the legislature required all municipalities and county governments to have a fraud hotline, which is confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1119)|
| 0:19:01| And we've done that, and the fraud hotline is we have an outside vendor who collects those calls, makes them untampered exactly as they can be, and complains to Andrea Addis and the internal audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1141)|
| 0:19:17| All of these items are confidential, and they're meant to be that way so there can be no access to anybody that makes an allegation of fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1157)|
| 0:19:28| So that takes care of the fraud or mismanagement of county property and county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| And then Andrea Addis is under the statute required to submit her report to the audit committee, which she does, generally in general terms as to whether this had any basis or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1174)|
| 0:19:47| If it gets any more detailed than that, it's still confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| And the state law says the audit committee can call an executive session to meet with Andrea to find out more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| And here again, anything from the fraud hotline, if there was a criminal act, it goes straight to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| If it's something other than that, it would go, like, especially in the executive branch, it would go to the mayor to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1207)|
| 0:20:16| That's a long summation, but that's basically the Code of Ethics and the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1216)|
| 0:20:28| So I'll entertain any questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| We have any questions for the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| I don't see any hands being raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Courtney, you're on the Ethics Committee, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1242)|

| 0:23:21| speaking to you today as the Vice Chair of the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair, for asking us to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Michael and I both appreciate the work that this committee is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| We're simply here to provide any information or answer questions that might assist you in your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| After last month's discussion regarding the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Chairman Covington and I felt that it would be advantageous for us to do some due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| just to better understand and address any fundamental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| or possible area of improvements for consideration to both the Knox County Code of Ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| and the rules of procedures of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| I think you all received our statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| And as you can see from that, not only did we spend some time talking with various county resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| we spent some time reviewing state and local legislation pertaining to ethics within government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| history of sworn complaints and their outcomes, amendments to both the Code of Ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| and the rules of procedures of the Ethics Committee, and the current means of reporting complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| We feel like Knox County has done a great job of following the 2006 state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| regarding implementing ethical standards related to the acceptance of gifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| and disclosure of conflicts of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| and that Knox County has elevated the county's approach to maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| and ensuring the highest level of ethical conduct, as well as open and fair due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| with the establishment of the 2007 Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Based on the discussion of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| we think that it's important to first point out that the Knox County Code of Ethics policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| are required by the State Comprehensive Governmental Ethics Reform Act of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| and it's codified in TCA 817-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| to include rules and regulations regarding limits on and or reasonable and systematic disclosure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| gifts or other things of value received by officials and employees that impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| or appear to impact their discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| and rules and regulations regarding reasonable and systematic disclosure by officials and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| of their personal interests that impact or appear to impact their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| It's also important to note that the provisions of the state law to the extent are more restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| and they have the control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Additionally, the Ethics Reform Act expressly states that these policies cannot include personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| or employment policies or policies or procedures related to operational aspects of government entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| The Ethics Committee is charged with the task of assuring fundamental fairness in all proceedings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| involving allegations of a violation of County Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| As previously stated, the County Ethics policy is required to cover the acceptance and disclosure of gifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| accepted by officials and employees and the disclosure of conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| So accordingly, an ethics complaint received by the County Ethics Committee does not address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| either the acceptance and or disclosure of a gift or conflict of interest need not proceed by the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| We also wanted to touch on the approved amendments to both the rules of the procedure of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| and subsequently the Knox County Code of Ethics that were brought forth for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| by then Chairman Jonathan Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| And these amendments were heard at the June 2018 Ethics Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| They were approved at the July 2018 Ethics Committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| and were approved by Knox County Commission in August of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| These amendments came after a series of six complaints filed from the year 2015 to the year 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| that were all dismissed with no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| According to our interviews and Chairman Covington's recollection as a sitting member of the committee at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| these amendments were provided to provide more specific language and clarification of what justifies an ethics complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1654)|
| 0:27:44| And it expounded the commencement of proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| I know that's a lot of information, but I hope that it's addressed any questions that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| And again, we just want to thank Commissioner Daley for including us and asking us for this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| And Chairman Covington and I are happy to try and answer any questions that you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| Hey, Michael, you're on here twice. Have you signed on twice? That may be why you're having reverb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1687)|
| 0:28:16| You're still muted, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Michael, I hate to interrupt you, but we do not understand a word you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1698)|
| 0:28:46| But I can't hear myself. I'm going to try to delete myself from one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| I'm at that location. I think I did it. Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| All right, well, let me try to make this quick and succinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Law Director Book said something very important that I want to expound on, and it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| There has been one real complaint that actually had a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| And that hearing, as Law Director Book said, was for Bob Thomas and Charlie Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| What ended up happening was that the committee recognized that that particular set of complaints, that pair of complaints, needed to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1759)|
| 0:29:29| We needed to allow for an investigation to see whether or not there was some chance that that complaint needed to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| We rightly saw, after hearing and reviewing the investigation, that that complaint did not need to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| And so at that hearing, that case ended up, those cases ended up being dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| What I would say about the committee itself is that we rely on the law director's office to vet these complaints as they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1791)|
| 0:30:00| and to only pass on to us complaints that fall within the criteria of what we are established to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1800)|
| 0:30:09| Even if the law director is reluctant about a particular case and it comes to the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| again, it's the ethics committee that will review that and decide if a hearing is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| If a hearing is not necessary, then that complaint goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| And even the influence of the news media should not serve to drag a person's name through the mud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| if it is determined that the complaint against them has no merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| So there are safeguards in place to make sure that a person's good name is withheld or is upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| I think there was some missteps in the way the last complaints were handled, whether it was a matter of timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| or whether it was a matter of uncertainty as to whether or not the ethics committee should actually receive the case or complaint of Bob Thomas and Charlie Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1852)|
| 0:31:02| I think moving forward, if a case were to be presented to the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| we can have a measure of confidence that a law director, Boock, and his staff would know whether or not a case is even worthy of coming to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1867)|
| 0:31:19| And I think that the citizenry and the taxpayers should be confident that once a case is deemed appropriate to come before the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1879)|
| 0:31:28| that the ethics committee is prepared to adjudicate those cases as necessary or prevent a hearing from going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| So I'd like to think that the system is good. It is sound. It does have safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| And I would hope that the committee and that the commission decides to retain the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| because I think it does have a valuable place in our local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do we have any questions for the commissioners from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| No questions, but just comments that I concur with our chair and vice chair of ethics committee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| this is something that I strongly believe needs to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| I absolutely hear what Mr. Covington said about hopefully the checks and balances from this point forward that will be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1947)|
| 0:32:39| so that anything that is totally frivolous is handled before it hits the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1959)|
| 0:32:49| Certainly, that's not anything any of us would want to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| And I do concur that there probably were some missteps, to put it kindly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| that occurred when this other situation came up during elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| That was just very, very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Thank you, Commissioner. Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Chair and Vice Chair, I like the email that we got today that says some of the changes from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2001)|
| 0:33:30| the only substantive changes were to add one year statute of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| How did you come up with the one year statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Commissioner Daly, what ended up happening in our review of how the cases or the complaints unfolded was the issue of whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2018)|
| 0:33:48| first and foremost, firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Firsthand knowledge became a big issue in terms of whether or not any of the cases should have moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| And as we saw, no one filing a complaint had firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| That was the first check. But the second check was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| And we put that year in because it was a compromise amongst the committee as relates to how long a person should have to file a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| And the crux of it was this. If you have firsthand knowledge, you have firsthand knowledge in real time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| which means if something occurs on January 1, you should be able to make that complaint, if that's your intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| you should be able to make that complaint in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| The time frame that we put on and the change that we agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| we thought was reasonable to allow a person who is a witness to or having firsthand knowledge of something would have a reasonable amount of time to make their complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2083)|
| 0:34:54| So that was the genesis for placing that time frame on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| But it was the firsthand knowledge that drove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| And again, no one filed a complaint amongst the complaints that we had in 2018 and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| None of those individuals had firsthand knowledge or none of those individuals understood what was meant by firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2108)|
| 0:35:18| I think a lot of people thought if they read it in the newspaper, that was firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Or if they saw a picture of something at a dinner or presentation, that that was firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| But the committee recognized and defined that that is not firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| So regardless of what the circumstance is bringing a complaint about, if you have firsthand knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| that time frame is the time frame that we feel we felt was necessary for a person that had firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| That 90 days says if I witness someone committing an ethics violation and to come before the ethics committee, you need to be, it's not hearsay evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2150)|
| 0:36:05| You need to be witness to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I should be able to do that within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| You mentioned 90 days and to me a year is way too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| If you're going to do, if you're going to do, and all I'm asking you to do is look at that, go back and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| You know, 90 days is still, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| And if you're really, if someone has really done an ethics complaint or an ethics violation, it shouldn't take a year for that person to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2185)|
| 0:36:33| My opinion, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Now, as far as the, I served on the ethics, I was one of the, I guess you want to say the founding members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| And it's not an easy job when you got somebody's, you know, life in your hands and their reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| And it's not an easy job and I appreciate both of you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| So I'm not here to tell you that I'm not here to do away with the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| All we were doing today is reviewing the ethics committee and what the ethics committee is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| And I love that these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Now, me personally, as a commissioner, I would ask that you go back and look at that one year's limitations and make it 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2228)|
| 0:37:19| I would love to see 90 days, six months at the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Because if you're going to file an ethics complaint, you're not waiting a year to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| If you do, my personal opinion is there's a motive behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| And you and I have, you and I tend to agree on most things in terms of logic and basic common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| And what I'd like to add to this is I was on the 90 day side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| The one year was a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| It wouldn't have been better had we gone with six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| But I can give you every every assurance that when we when we meet again, we will address this as a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| And we'll have to educate and familiarize folks on the committee who were not involved in the previous cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2280)|
| 0:38:08| We'll have to kind of bring them up to speed on where we are and where we were and what the basis of our decision was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| So what I'd like to do is to is to commit to that during this committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| We don't meet again until February, but but we will put that on new business and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| And and this time around, I think you'll be pleased with with the the compromise that we'll make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| I think at the outside is more than enough time, more than enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| We'll just sit and we'll get right back to to, I guess, this committee or the commission and let you know what we arrived at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| But but that should be changed. And I hope we can change it when we meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| Well, thank you. This committee is not going anywhere. I'm sure that I don't think that we would even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| I would like to wrap this committee up today and do a summary and get it to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| So if there's not any other questions for the chair or vice chair of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| Well, we're going to move on. Terry, is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| It's a clarification on my minutes. So to be clear, Mike and Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2356)|
| 0:39:25| It sounds like you tried to redefine firsthand knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| And you at this point are looking at, but have not made a recommendation on the time frame involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2372)|
| 0:39:43| In filing an ethics complaint, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| That is correct. Commissioner Hill and we'll rely on law director to give us some guidance as to how we go about approaching making that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2388)|
| 0:40:00| And I think that the adjustment is something that given an adequate explanation, I think that's something that we can make happen in our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| Very good. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| All right. Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I agree with everything Mr. Covington had said with regard to the past meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| There were some other procedural things, which very much troubled me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| On the Charlie Bussler, Bob Thomas issue, we sent out our investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| Our department has its own investigator, former FBI agent, and then was at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| Very competent. He went out and did a thorough investigation of the allegations, which were hearsay allegations against Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| And what he came back with was there was nothing. And so that was the opinion we said it shouldn't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| However, the press picked up on the fact that there had been a complaint filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| There was a very hot contested election going on for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| And so then the chairman at the time said, well, we've got to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| So that's the way that happened. And that disturbed me greatly because I thought it was unfair to the campaigners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| And when we were talking about changes, Mr. Covington reflected the 90 days as opposed to the one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2480)|
| 0:41:29| I was along with Mr. Covington should be 90 days. If you can't do it within 90 days, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| But the other one that very much troubled me was it had been used now and it had been used earlier back in 2009 or 10 for political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2494)|
| 0:41:44| And that disturbed me greatly. I thought it was unfair. It was unfair to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| And I wanted to change the procedural rules that no complaints would be accepted during a certain time leading up to an election because they can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2510)|
| 0:42:03| Somebody can just throw something in, whether it's frivolous or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| And then that person's name gets in the paper, like Lee Trammell and Thomas and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| And they didn't do anything, but they're out there and the press has a heyday with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| And that that was not adopted by the committee. I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| I do not think this committee should in any way or this code of ethics should in any way be used for political advancement of one person or one cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2544)|
| 0:42:34| So I agree with what Mr. Covington said, but I think there are additional if this committee stays in additional limitations that should be put on procedural rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2554)|
| 0:42:46| Mr. Chair, do you agree to that, to revisit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| I do recall, Commissioner Daley, I do recall that being a bone of contention when we had the discussion about the time frame leading up to an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2570)|
| 0:43:01| And I think the members of the committee, as I recall, they were just uncommitted about whether or not there should be a limitation placed on the filing of a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2581)|
| 0:43:16| And I think the sticking point was this. If the if the violation occurs within six months of an election occurring, then are we giving the are we giving the complaining party or the plaintiff in the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2596)|
| 0:43:33| Are we giving them a requisite amount of time to file their complaint if the if the incident occurred, say, six months before an election actually occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2613)|
| 0:43:45| And I think the discussion kind of went in the direction of, well, if the candidate commits a viable or commits a violation of the ethics codes, then they are subject to a complaint being filed to them because of the timing of the commission of the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2625)|
| 0:44:05| That was that was the sticking point. And and Law Director Booth is right. It was a bone of contention. It is something that could be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2645)|
| 0:44:16| But I must say, if if a violation occurs a month before the election or six months before the election, the candidate is subject to to the scrutiny of the act, not the timing of when they committed the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2656)|
| 0:44:32| And so if you've got firsthand knowledge of something that a candidate who may not have even declared six months before an election, if that candidate does something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2672)|
| 0:44:43| Six months before an election or primary occurs and then three months later, they they take out a petition and they and they get themselves on the ballot, then the committee was feeling as though they were subject to the rules of the ethics committee, regardless of the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2683)|
| 0:45:01| From from the occurrence of the incident to the election, and we could not reconcile that, we just could not make that make sense. None of the cases that we had fell under that category, not one of them, because they were hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2701)|
| 0:45:16| They were not firsthand knowledge. And and there was a trip left from when the incident occurred to when the complaint was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2716)|
| 0:45:29| It is something that we can revisit, but but but I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| Michael, you're cutting out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Wanting to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| Curse within the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| If the occurs so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Okay, well, what I will say, if you can hear me is we will revisit this issue at our February meeting and we'll try to get back to you with with with what we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2757)|
| 0:46:07| But when we, when we broached the subject of the time frame, that's an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| When we start talking about the timing of when an incident occurs, that may be a little bit more challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| You know, the time frame, the 90 days to me is is good, but my most my biggest concern is is hearsay evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| No hearsay evidence, the person that files that complaint needs to witness and at the law department says their investigator says that it was hearsay evidence. There was no truth to it. It shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2787)|
| 0:46:42| The name should not even be brought up, so that's what this my personal opinion. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| We're going to run short of time, so I'm going to go ahead and try to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Any, any last questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Law director, I, I've still got what I think was a terrible injustice to Mr. Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2812)|
| 0:47:02| And Lee Trammell and everybody that had just the filing of that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| When somebody's already picked up a petition and they're running, that is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| In my mind, that is not right. That is unfair and it shouldn't be countenanced in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| All right, so we're going to Mr. chair and vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| Take that up in February and I'll probably come and sit in and listen to the meeting too. If you don't care, you don't mind. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| All right, thank you both for being here. Thank you for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| I know y'all lose sleep over these decisions like I didn't so next on our agenda is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2857)|
| 0:47:46| The removal vote on the Carson, if I may, you didn't I don't think you saw my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2866)|
| 0:47:55| Just a clarification on process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Mr. Law director, any changes that this committee, the ethics committee recommends in their rules or their procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| Is this something that has to come before the commission or is this something that they can do at their discretion and and bring merely their, their document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2890)|
| 0:48:21| What is proceed? How does that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2901)|

| 0:48:30| Procedural rules, they recommend it to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| All right. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you. Thank you. Commissioner next order of business is to have the vote on removal or abolishing the court subcommittee, which we all agree that it's not necessary for my cam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2916)|
| 0:48:49| And so I would entertain a motion from someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2929)|

| 0:49:24| I've seen it. Yes, he's on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And Commissioner Monday. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| And Commissioner daily says, yes, so that's 5 eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| And no, no, so it passes the next order of business or any other businesses. My plans are to wrap this committee up today unless someone sees and this necessity to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2978)|
| 0:49:52| I will do a summary of what we've done the committees and how many committees they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| I will get that summary, hopefully, in the next week or so, send it to drew, send it to you. I'll let you all look over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=2997)|

| 0:50:10| Hopefully, for the January meeting, you know, suggestions and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| Mr. law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Since we voted to abolish the core subcommittee that will have to be put into a resolution before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=3019)|
| 0:50:27| Commission, we can do that in January, right? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Yeah, that's what we'll do. So, if it's okay with everyone, I'll do the summary and get it to everyone so they can look over it and then refine it or whatever we need to do, then get it to the chairman. Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201214-committee-on-committees?start=3031)|
