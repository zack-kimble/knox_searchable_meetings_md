| 0:00:00| Ladies and gentlemen, it is four o'clock and it is time for us to begin our public forum segment of our Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| We have our regular meeting scheduled for five o'clock, which will be a voting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| But we wanted to give those of you who are here and who wanted to speak an opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| So, clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=17)|
| 0:00:19| Commissioner McKenzie. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=19)|
| 0:00:20| Commissioner Broyles. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=20)|

| 0:00:25| Commissioner Anders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Commissioner Smith. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=26)|
| 0:00:28| Commissioner Wright. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=28)|
| 0:00:31| Commissioner Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| Commissioner Hammond. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| Commissioner Shouse. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| Ten of eleven commissioners are present, so we're going to go right into our public forum segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| We will tell you that we're going to be allocating three minutes, up to three minutes, for each individual who will be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| We're going to ask that you keep your comments brief and stay within the allotted time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| I will tell you when your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| The second thing I would like to say is, obviously, there's a lot of interest in the action that we are prepared to take this afternoon with the items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| I know that some of you are in favor of certain aspects of the budget proposal and some of you are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| And so we're going to ask that, as people speak, that you be respectful to those who are speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| We are neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| We go to church together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| We shop together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| We love Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| And we might disagree on this issue, but let's be respectful to one another as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| And so I'm going to ask that you help us with that and that we maintain proper decorum as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| I know you will because you've helped us with that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| The first person that we have signed up to speak is Beth Blevins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Is Beth Blevins here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| If you would come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Also, Bob Savory and Pam Treanor, you're going to be ‑‑I'm just trying to help move this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| So if you would know that, Bob, if you would be ready to come to the podium after Ms. Blevins and Ms. Treanor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| if you would be coming after Bob Savory, I'll do two or three at a time so we can perhaps help expedite things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| So, Ms. Blevins, if you would give us your address for the record, please, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Yes, I am Beth Blevins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| I'm principal at South Dole Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| And I'm here speaking on behalf of the educators that are in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| I can tell you that education is one of the fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| one of the only fields that touches all other aspects of life, all other careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| And yet education is one of those fields that we have historically allowed teachers to work on their own time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=148)|
| 0:02:35| to provide their own materials, to do everything that it takes to educate the children with very limited funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=155)|
| 0:02:43| This is an opportunity at this point to make that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| This is an opportunity to make sure that the funding that's provided education here in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| matches where we want our goals to be, and that is to be a world class school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| Working analogies, anybody who knows me knows that I historically will give a story to prove my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| Well, I think it's kind of like losing weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| I've heard people say it's throwing money at a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Well, the analogy would be to throw money at, you know, a weight loss center or a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| But that's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Dr. McIntyre and his team have come up with a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| We have very focused goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| And every dollar spent is to ensure that it goes back to our young kids that are in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| that eventually will be the businessmen and women of tomorrow that will draw in other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| And so, you know, I don't like when I hear throwing money at a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| It is not throwing money at a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| It is investing wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Another woman, a wise woman, once said that if you don't make decisions that are criticized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| then you don't make educational and impactful decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I'm asking you to think about the decisions that you make concerning this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| and they might be criticized, but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| if you can look at our 55,000 children in the eye and say we did it for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| because those are the unheard voices in this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| and you can put your head on the pillow at night, which I want to be able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| then you've made the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Bob Savory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| And then we'll hear from Pam Traynor and then Ann Abbott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Yes, my name is Bob Savory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| I live at 9320 Camrose Lane in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Me, my wife and the bank own a home in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| We have two Knox County students, an upcoming senior and a junior at Carnes High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| I'm also a 26-year veteran in the Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| with 29 years total in the classroom in three states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| First, let me commend the school system and their supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| on one of the most amazing media campaigns I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| The problem is with that media campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| it kind of throws off that spirit of cooperation you tried to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| with the county commission during your retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| You have now put these commissioners between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Do the schools need an extra $35 million a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Of course they do, but so do a lot of other departments in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Am I willing to pay the extra taxes on my property in Carnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| But I'm blessed to have enough money to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Do I trust this huge amount of money to the folks in the A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Please remember, Knox County received $26.5 million from Race to the Top funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| They promptly sent $17.6 million to Lowell Milken's TAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| This is the same Lowell Milken banned from Wall Street for life, charged with securities fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| Had it not been for the plea bargain his brother Michael Milken worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| Lowell would have gone to jail too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| Is TAP a good program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| But all the positive research on TAP comes from the program itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| or the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching, another Milken Family Foundation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| I could find no independent research on the incentive pay program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| Right now in the real world of research statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| it runs about 50-50 as to the success of these incentive pay or strategic compensation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| TAP better work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| At $250 to $400 a student per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Lowell Milken is a California billionaire who has figured out that by 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| the privatizing of America's schools is projected to be a $39 billion industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| He is not an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| We could have just dusted off Lamar Alexander's career ladder of the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| kept that $17.6 million in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| and we would have had an evaluation system built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| We pay our superintendent more than any sitting congressman or woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| any sitting senator, and more than the U.N. Secretary General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| I expect more creativity for $247,011 and $14,000 in fringe benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| and I believe most taxpayers do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| I wish I could trust the folks in the A.J. building, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| That backpack sitting right there of proof didn't impress me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| because I believe I can fill a backpack full of refuting evidence as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| It's kind of come down to, I guess, for you guys, pretty much like a law case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Have they proven what they're saying beyond a reasonable doubt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| If they have, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| I'll back you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I'll pay my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| I won't complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| But if you have a reasonable doubt, then my suggestion is that you vote no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| or you at least compromise in some shape, form, or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Also, Pam, before you begin, those of you who are in the back, if you're wanting a seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| we do have an upper level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Some people don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| That's why I mentioned that if you would like a seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| you're more than happy to go up to the upper level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| but you're more than happy to stay where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| So, Ms. Treanor, if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Pam Treanor, 3017 Hackman Street, for 49 years, the same house, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| Commissioners, I stand before you today as a mother, a volunteer, a business owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| as well as your school board member from the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| I'm hoping against all hope for your approval of the school board's budget tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| Our community will lose so much if this budget is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| I'm well aware of the commitment to our community that our community will make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| and as a community member, business and property owner, I am ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| As a duly elected Board of Education member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| I am sworn to do what is right and best for education in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| This bold and courageous move, I believe, is right and best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| This budget comes to you from an 8-to-1 vote of our entire board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| All nine of us come to you from different backgrounds and professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| The schools we represent have different needs and different challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Only one of us voted no, and his community stood behind him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| clad in green and adorned with hornets, and said, raise our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| We will gladly pay if it means our children will get what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Well, they got their school. Our mayor saw to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| This Board of Education had very little to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| and now that mayor is using campaign tactics to keep the rest of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| from getting what they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| This is an outright shame that the community and the commissioners elected to represent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| would be used in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| As far as my own community south, we have a lot to lose, most likely more than we ever have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Major improvements to three of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Might I add that one of those schools, New Hopewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| is the only school in recent history that was ever promised by a school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Not a mayor, a school board some 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| that was to replace the temporary building put up 15 years prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| after a fire destroyed the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| The land was bought, and it still sits in the same structure today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Caught on fire again two weeks ago tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| and was most likely saved from massive destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| by a quick thinking of Miss Sandy and Mr. Wooten, the secretary and custodian up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Then there's the possibility of extra parking at Moreland Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| How many of you have ever gotten a parking citation at open house at your children's school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| because there are only enough parking spaces for the staff in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| What does that say to family engagement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| And we're losing family south at an alarming rate, going to blunt and severe counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| where they tell me, and I quote, they care more about education there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| So don't tell me, a veteran PTA, PTO mom, that parents aren't engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| They are. It's just that the ones left can't carry the weight of all those leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| It's so much more than just subjects mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| It's help and resources, not devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It's the technology to run them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| We have one school that can manage that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Also, please think before making the statement that our teachers are failing our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| I'm just back from college orientation with my youngest child at Tulane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| He's going there on his own academic merits, although his father and I were both there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| for he and his sister every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| The great and wonderful teachers in those South Knoxville schools, stand up South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| do take and have every right to take as much credit for his success as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| Before you vote, just ask yourselves, do we have all that we need to succeed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| Can we really be the best school system in the Southeast that we promised ourselves that we would be at our retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Next we have Ann Abbott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Then we're going to hear from Jim Toussaint and then Melanie Harb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| So if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| My name is Ann Thomas Abbott, 3018 Sevier Avenue, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| I'm addressing the commission today as a South Knoxville taxpayer, as a proud graduate of Doyle High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| and the South Knoxville Theater Schools, as a parent of a Knox County student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| and as a classroom teacher just finishing my 18th year of service to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| As a taxpayer and property owner, I can afford a tax increase to fund the school board's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| I was raised to believe that things go better when everybody pitches in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| and whether we call this an investment or a purchase, our school system is a strong one and it deserves our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| As a parent, I'm glad to see a priority in the proposed budget for our school buildings and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| All communities want their school buildings to be well taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| and it is good stewardship of our resources to make improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| without incurring the additional cost associated with going into debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| As a Knoxvillian, I believe the community schools initiative in the budget provides us a way for our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| to lead the state in equipping our schools with more resources that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| to make sure all children and families have what they need to be healthy, informed, and successfully participating citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| And as a classroom teacher, I want to appeal to you on two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| It is an interesting irony that for many classroom teachers, professional advancement means leaving the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| The strategic compensation plan in the budget is a way to recognize and reward classroom teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| for staying and taking on leadership locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| It provides for the professional advancement of more teachers at school-based sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| where mentoring, coaching, leadership, and teaching are most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Additionally, we in the classroom, students and teachers, face higher than ever performance and achievement standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| I know we can meet those standards, but to get every student over a very high bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| we will need more instructional time and more support for classroom teachers, which this budget provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| The issue before us is a big debate and a good one to have, even though it has been tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| I want everyone assembled here to remember that teachers, students, parents, and taxpayers are all natural allies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| We depend on each other, our roles overlap, and ultimately we all want the same thing, what is best for our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| Please give us your support by supporting the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Next is Jim Toussaint, and then we'll have Melanie Harb, then David Williams, then Karen Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| So, Mr. Toussaint, if you'd give us your address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| 633 Gulfwood Road, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Thanks to everyone for the orderliness of these proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| We are spending a lot on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| The administration's proposal is roughly $397 million with a $10 to $13 million increase over the previous budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=882)|
| 0:14:54| We are spending a lot because the county debt exceeds $1 billion, or roughly $2,300 per capita, or $5,600 on each household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=894)|
| 0:15:07| I've been here 30 years, and I didn't know that until the last year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Debt is always something to worry about, and it must be addressed in policy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| The requested tax increase falls harder on businesses and employers because business pays 40 percent assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| while residents pay 25 percent assessed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| A business with a million-dollar building, which is not a big business, will pay $1,400 more in taxes each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| If the economy stays weak, the business will reduce raises, not hire or lay off workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| All three, of course, are bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Further, duplexes and apartment owners will raise rents at the first opportunity because they are considered commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| and face a higher tax than residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Even worse, a mobile home owner who rents small lots will also raise lot rents because they are considered commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=958)|
| 0:16:06| and will face approximately a 15 percent tax increase, which they usually pass on to renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| The salary number I have for certified teachers is roughly $44,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| When you add pension and medical benefits, the salaries for teachers and certain administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| above the Knox County averages for similar work qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| Economists consider a property tax a flat tax because the rate is the same on small and large homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| Flat taxes tend to move resources from lower income to lower asset people to higher asset people and higher income people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=996)|
| 0:16:46| Think about the mobile home lot rental operation, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| There is a bit of unfairness in a property tax environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Another problem is the appraisal of commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| In 2013, all properties will be reappraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| I think Sevier County lost some revenue in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| It's kind of complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Another problem on education and most other operations is a wage and salary increase of, say, 5 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| does not guarantee a 5 percent test score increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| That's the way economics works, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Because of the proceeding, no one should be surprised or shocked by a no vote on a 35 percent tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| I would like more revenue for schools through increased economic activity rather than a tax rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| Mr. Tutson, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Finish your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Most of us in this room could handle a residential tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| but a property tax increase is paid by nearly all Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| We'll hear from Melanie Harb, David Williams, Karen Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Ms. Harb, if you'd give us your address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| Melanie Harb, New Hope Elementary School, 757 Kimberlin Heights Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| I stand before you today as an educator with 26 years of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and am in the process of completing one of the most challenging years ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| I feel that we are truly in the largest educational reform movement in the history of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| We have laws that are being mandated not by Knox County, but by our state and federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| And our students and our educators are being held accountable to very rigorous standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| That is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| We need to go in this direction, but we need to understand that in order to begin to meet these standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| we must for once place serious dollars into our educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| We as educators take part in molding our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Not only do we assess our children to determine academic growth and hold ourselves accountable for that growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| but we encourage our children to be independent and critical thinkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| We push them to do their personal best, even if they are resistant to trying as hard as they can each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| We also take their temperature when they are sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| We hold their hand and we listen to them when they are hurting inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| And yes, we have even taken on the role of clothing them and feeding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| We do all of this in order to give the opportunity for our children to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| However, it is getting harder to accomplish these expectations due to the increasing need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| The budget that has been placed before you encourages every aspect of my above statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| It is putting technology into the hands of our children to keep them engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| It is providing instructional tools to help our children who struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| and also addressing the needs of our children that need enrichment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| It is placing instructional coaches in our schools to provide support to students and staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| as we delve into the rigor of the new Common Core Standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| It is preparing our students and our staff for the future of educational expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| On May 8th, South Knoxville administrators met with a few of our county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| and conducted dialogue regarding this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Commissioner Hammond, at this meeting you asked me what my school would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| and I feel that I gave you a very practical overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner Brown, you were there as well and you clearly listened to my statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| as well as to the statements of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| On May 25th, you visited my school and spoke with me privately regarding the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| I did not waver in my stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| I once again clearly and candidly reiterated to you my support of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| Anyone who knows me and has worked with me knows that I am very opinionated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| and do not care to vocalize it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I have had several conversations with my supervisors and Dr. McIntyre himself when the need arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| I do not fear my superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| I respect the expectations that he has established for his employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and I know that he will hold us accountable to those expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| as well as himself to the same expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Ms. Harb, if you could finish your point please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| I only hope that each of you will also help us begin to meet the expectations by approving this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| Please know you have heard my voice today, but not only my voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| but the voice of South Knoxville administrators Muncie Harbin, Dr. Roy Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Glef Bevins who have already spoken, Angie Herod, Linda Norris, Pat Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you for your time and I hope you will take careful consideration for approving this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| We have, next we have David Williams, then Karen Loy, then Chris Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| We'll go ahead and I'll make note of the fact that if he comes in we'll be happy to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| So Karen Loy, if you would be next, then Chris Henderson, then Marshall Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| And if you would give us your address for the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Hi, I'm Dr. Karen Loy, the principal of Northwest Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| and very well can speak of the concerns of the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| However, I am not a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| So I am rendering my time to Tim Wittgenstein who is a fellow principal in the middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| and a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| If you can read this, thank a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| It's a bumper sticker phrase that I see periodically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| but in the light of the current debate on education funding in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| probably not often enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| The role of education in a democratic society cannot be valued enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| It is the very nature of our democracy that provides the opportunity for debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| on an endless variety of topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| And the primary aim of education is to develop in young people the values, attitudes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| and models of behavior appropriate for active participation in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| My experience has been that many Tennesseans view themselves as volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| hardy individuals with a pioneering spirit, willing to face challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| overcome obstacles, and lend a hand to neighbors in time of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| I have seen countless examples of this attitude in my years as a school teacher, counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| and principal working with families and school communities throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| The stakes are high for our community to consider funding education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| Our Chamber of Commerce President, Mr. Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| often speaks on the value of having excellent educational opportunities in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| when businesses, companies, and corporations look to start or relocate in a community or region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| Our Superintendent of Schools, Dr. McIntyre, has worked tirelessly to bring about positive results in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| and has made difficult financial decisions already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| cutting maintenance, custodial, and central office personnel in order to protect classroom instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| Our own County Mayor, Mr. Burchett, recognized the need for our school system to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| and personally found a way to resource and fund the renovation of Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| Surely our county leaders and officials can see beyond the immediate politically expedient choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| and make decisions based on what's good for the residents of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| their children, and future generations living and working in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| I urge this commission to adequately fund our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| consider the long-range benefits of this budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| The children of Knox County deserve the very best that we can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Chris Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| And sir, thank you for being here, and if you would give us your address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you for having me. My name is Chris Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I'm the principal of Halls Elementary School at 7502 Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| And I come to you as a parent, an educator, and a citizen of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| to implore you to vote to fully fund the budget proposed by the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| It is an ambitious yet necessary proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| which will help us continue to strive to bring our schools to the next level of excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Let us think about what an education means to us as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Yes, it means a skilled workforce and therefore more attraction to businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| but it also means possibilities for our boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| We are one of the few countries that educates all of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Because an education opens the door to a world of possibilities for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| giving them the tools to pursue any dream that they might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Who of us does not use some form of technology in our daily lives, both professionally and personally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| Ten years ago, could you have envisioned the menagerie of technological capabilities that exist today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| Can you imagine performing your job functions without these technologies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| From email, social media, Google searches to e-books and Skype,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| almost any ordinary person has access to a magnitude of people and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| that was unimaginable only a few decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Yet we are asking schools to prepare our children to live in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| without the tools that so many of us use on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Due to budget constraints, our school district does not currently fund technology purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| for our classrooms, libraries, labs or teachers at the elementary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| We must rely on school-level fundraising to meet these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| We are so fortunate in Halls to have a committed and supportive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| However, even with their generous backing, it is still a struggle to keep pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| with the ever-evolving technological needs of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Let us think of this budget request as an investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Make no mistake, we are competing with surrounding counties for the most talented educators available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| In recent years, Halls Elementary alone has lost four stellar educators to another nearby school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| where they went on to the same positions to earn $10,000 more annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| How long can we afford to lose our best and brightest teachers to the systems just down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| These requested dollars are for the benefit of all of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| According to the National Center for Educational Statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Knox County ranks seventh among the nation among large school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| in terms of percentage of the total budget going to instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Through instructional coaching support, academic interventions and full-day kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| you can be certain that these dollars will be closely tied to student instructional needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| We welcome rigorous benchmarks for our schools, teachers and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| We're being held to higher standards than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| In order to meet these expectations, though, we need as much support as we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| I come to you speaking as a parent, citizen and educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| I'm also voicing the sentiment of the North Area Elementary principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Adrian Burnett, Ricky McLeod, Copper Ridge, Coryton, Fountain City, Gibbs, Inskip, Powell and Shannondale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| We stand united behind the school board's recommended budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Let us think truly of this request as an investment in our children, an investment in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Let me also, once again, for those of you who have come in, you're welcome to stand in the back if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| but we do have an upper level and a lot of people just don't know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| but there are plenty of seats on the upper level if you would like a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| But if you would like to stand in the back, you're certainly welcome to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Marshall Walker, David Claxton and then Jonathan Belozia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| So those will be the next three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| And if you'd give us your address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| My name is Marshall Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| My address is 129 South Elmwood Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| The first major concern I have, when I moved back to Knoxville in 2000, I became a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| And no one could explain to me, because Knoxville was going through the same thing that Nashville was going through at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| why Knoxville, I mean city property owners pay city and county taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| and why county property owners only pay city taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| So I want to start with that and explain, and maybe you can explain later on why that occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| because I think that's an unfair situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| My concerns also exist regarding the school board and decisions they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| But before I start, let me qualify who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I work for Knox County Schools from 2000 to 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| I retired as a school social worker and assistant football coach at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| My concern is a lot of decisions that the school board has been making appears to be based on political affiliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1756)|
| 0:29:26| rather than educational equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| And that means making decisions for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Concerns as to why the school board still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| I mean, my concerns exist regarding why the school board target most resources towards the high school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| rather than the elementary level if they really are sincere about improving the system for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| In the educational system, this is my analogy, it's similar to building a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| You cannot build a structure and expect it to stand, start with building the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| In the educational system, the foundation is the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| And the school board appears to put too many of our resources at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| I don't know why that takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| If something occurs and you decide to fund the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| I suggest that a yearly review panel exist because the school board sometimes do not follow the pattern that exists when funds come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1828)|
| 0:30:43| and they received it based on an initial funding proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| For example, Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I was one of ten members who flew to Houston, Texas to observe the Project Grad program in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1852)|
| 0:31:02| And I can assure you the founders did not appropriate $15 million for the program to exist as it exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| And I really hope that you make a good decision and make an educational decision rather than a political decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| David Claxton and then Jonathan Belozia, then Virginia Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| If you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| My name is David Claxton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| I live at 3837 Gooseneck Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| Ladies and gentlemen of the Knox County Commission, good afternoon to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| I wanted to send you a word of encouragement to vote in favor of the proposed budget you will be considering today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| As a Knox County taxpayer, I must say that I am ready to step up and pay my fair share to make the schools a better place for my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1908)|
| 0:32:00| I grew up, attended school, and currently live in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| In fact, I have put 37920 on my address for almost 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| Moreover, I am an employee of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| More specifically, I teach at Southville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| My children attend Southville Middle School, where my wife also teaches sixth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| Needless to say, my family has a vested interest in the improvement of the school system, especially the South Knoxville ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| When I consider the progress that our school system has made in recent years, I grow hungry for more improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| When I look at the TCAP scores my own children work so hard for each year, I feel blessed to have my children attending Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| When I talk to my students in my classes, I see so much potential that just a little more resources might surely begin to tap into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| I support the proposed budget because I feel that it will speed up the process of change and improvement that we have started to experience already in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1971)|
| 0:33:01| Similarly, I feel funds raised will immediately improve the schools of my community in South Knoxville, especially in regards to technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| I believe an affirmative vote for the proposed budget will help us take a step toward being the best school system in the southeastern United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| a goal that all of us set, including you guys, for us earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| The research has been done. The accountability will be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| All we need now is an opportunity to speed up the process of making the dreams of students, teachers, schools, and communities come true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| The opportunity is staring us all in the face today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| My hope is that you will choose to embrace that opportunity for its simplicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| The simplicity is that we have a chance to make a positive difference in our schools today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| As a teacher, there are two key components to my calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Make a difference in my community and serve my students to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| I have never served my community in the capacity that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| but I would argue that making a difference and serving the best interest of our community is also a key component of who you are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| In that regard, we are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you for your time, and I hope that our school system, one that we all want to be the best, will have a reason to celebrate in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| If you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| 3508 Peachwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| My name is Jonathan Beloga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I am a citizen of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| I'm a member of the Knoxville Tea Party, and I own a business here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| I wrote a brief explanation of my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| In order to agree to a permanent tax increase, sufficient evidence must be given to support the notion that this plan will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| This plan does not provide the necessary evidence to support the notion that it will achieve its intended goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Raising taxes deters investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| If you're looking for an investment vessel such as a CD, would you choose one that leaves you with more or less money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| It's as simple as that with the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| This decision will make doing business in Knoxville less attractive to everyone, and we have absolutely no proof that this plan will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| I do not consent to a 19 percent property tax increase for an ill-conceived plan to fix our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| It would be nothing less than irresponsible to guarantee less business activity in Knoxville in exchange for a plan that has a high probability of not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2129)|
| 0:35:38| Right now, families are forced to make their dollars stretch farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I expect nothing less from my government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Our national debt is quickly dwarfing our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| What I see is an irresponsible government unwilling to consent to the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| I spoke with Commissioner Briggs, who declared that of the calls that he received, three to one were against this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2155)|
| 0:36:06| I would ask that you listen to your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| All that I can do as a concerned citizen is voice my opposition to irresponsible fiscal behavior because it puts a burden on all of us, including our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2169)|
| 0:36:20| That's my written comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| From my heart, what I feel is I see the intent of this plan, and I do believe that it is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2182)|
| 0:36:30| I believe that everybody in here is here because we are concerned about the direction of our education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| We all want to make it better, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Wouldn't you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| We all want to make this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| What I see is that the proposed solutions to children not being able to read, say, like with a third-grade reading level, iPads are not the solution to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2204)|
| 0:36:58| So that is my opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Commissioner Briggs told me that at Austin East, if you take the amount of absences in the whole school and divide it by the number of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| that's 35 absences per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| But throwing money at the problem is not going to make those students go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| And there's no accountability in terms of how this money is going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Once we give it to the school board, they can use it for whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| We don't have any control over it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| If you could finish up your point, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| That is my opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| We'll hear from Virginia Babb, then Karen Carson, then Jessica Holman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| My name is Virginia Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| I live at 5332 Riverbrier Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| I am here in support of the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| What I would like to do is ask everyone here that is here for support of the budget to please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2270)|
| 0:38:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Okay, folks, folks, folks, folks, we ask that you please not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I just wanted to get a sense of how many people are showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| and have shown up every county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| How many school employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Sir, if you have another outburst, I will have you removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And that's not an idle threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| We are going to maintain proper decorum here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I ask that we be respectful to one another, and I intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2312)|
| 0:38:42| How many people have shown up at every county commission meeting over the last few weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Many speakers have spoken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| We've had many groups that have shown up and put out their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| We've had the chamber, the PTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| We've had the inner city ministers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| We've had the board of realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Lots of different groups and individuals across Knox County have continued to show their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| I realize that there was a huge increase in negative opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| after calls were made by the mayor about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| I understand that went out, and I realize it was a knee-jerk reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| when people got a call asking them to call their commissioners in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| However, I would like to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| there was no information for people to find out why this increase was being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| It would have been very interesting if, in that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| it had been a place for you to find out more information about the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| and why this money was being required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| There also have been some polls that have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| And I would like to point out that we elect y'all to be leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| We don't go for polls to make the decisions in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| We would like for y'all who have had the time to get educated on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Many of you I've spoken to that have seemed on the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| or not sure about what you're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| seem to say you realize the schools need funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| yet it seems to be a hard decision for you to make on whether to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| I'd like to ask you today to step up, act as leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| and vote for the funding of the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| Next we have Karen Carson, then Jessica Holman, and then Jim Thiessen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| If you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| It's 10953 Twin Harbor, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Mr. Chairman and commissioners, I want to thank you first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| for the amount of time that you have spent on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| It shows me that you understand it's a decision of a great magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| that requires a tremendous amount of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| The school board also understands the time that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Four years ago, we worked with all stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| to form a strategic plan for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| We've spent the past three years implementing this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| field testing new ideas, establishing reliable outcome measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| defining ways to evaluate success, and making adjustments as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| We've piloted a number of the components recommended in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| and we've refined them to better assure the likelihood of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| prior to asking our citizens to contribute any more of their hard-earned money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| Only after three years of work have we come to you with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| that we firmly believe will improve the student academic outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| and also enhance the economic well-being of our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| I know you've received many calls, e-mails, and letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| both pro and con, about a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| As you make your final determination on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I ask that you do not base it solely on a final tally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Some think this is the fair way to do it, but I firmly disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| When I first began talking to groups about our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| the general sentiment in the room was always, we don't want more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| But as I answered questions, dispelled misinformation, addressed rumors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| explained benefits, return on investments, and accountability measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| people became supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Like you, most people support our schools and are willing to pay more taxes for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| as long as they know the funds are going to be used appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Our proposed budget will result in improved outcomes for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| and our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| There is no perfect time for a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| but leaders have got to plan for tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| or tough times will only continue and possibly get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| When was the last time you got a call from a citizen saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| I want you to tax me more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| How about 1,000 calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| This is unprecedented in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I will close with a final thought from Proverbs 29-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2580)|
| 0:43:10| Where there is no vision, the people perish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| I ask that you vote yes to this school budget request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| and lead with us as we bring our community forward and invest in excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| Jessica Holman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Is Jessica Holman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| We'll move on to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| I believe this is Thiessen, T-H-U-E-S-E-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I wanted to make sure you had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Joyce Martin and then Terry Carruthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| If you would give us your address for the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| My name is Joyce Martin, and I live at 4116 Oakland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| I'm representing all these old people that their houses have been handed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| that live on $400 to $300 a month social security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| They cannot afford to get a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| If they knew that it was going towards the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| which the commissioners and schools both deserve it, I know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| but they cannot afford a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| We'll hear from Terry Carruthers and then Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Terry Carruthers, 6102 Arcadia Drive, 37920, South Knoxville resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| Colonial Village resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| proud graduate of Moreland Heights Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| and Young Junior Senior High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| We've heard a lot about technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| talking technology in school that really does not need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| in the elementary classroom or in the middle school classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Are you aware that computer mobile parents at eBay, at Google, at Apple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| at Hewlett Packard purposely send their children to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| that are completely devoid of technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| It's because they know, as this other gentleman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| you have to have a good foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| You have to have a good foundation of the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Research shows that technology in the elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| and the middle school classroom reduces student comprehension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| increases distractibility, reduces memory capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| and reduces attention spans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Why do our schools set aside time each year to coach students to take TCAPS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| We were never coached to take standardized tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| It was because we had a literature-based curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| that taught reading, decoding, comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| We could read instruction and follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Our teachers read aloud to us 15 to 30 minutes per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| And I'm confident that if you transported those teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| and that curriculum in today's school system, we would not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| As to the budget, they keep saying it's all about getting the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| into the classroom and getting it to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Then why has Mr. McIntyre said he's going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| three additional administrative positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| He has a merit pay plan with no final costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and an indication of how many would qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| He has a plan that is not endorsed by the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| He has a plan that would remove best teachers from the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| and promote them to coaches, which begs the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| what happens to that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Do they need more teachers to fill it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| And are the students then left with these mediocre teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| I support teachers. I support the public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| But I cannot support a curriculum that is failing our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Mr. McIntyre has a very large salary, and it's primarily because of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| If he's truly invested in this program, let him take a pay cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| and put that money towards the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| Let them take a cut from the rainy day funds that they have quite an overage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Let them take part of that money and put it into this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| if they're truly invested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Divest themselves of the surplus property that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| if they are truly invested in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| There are means that they can have good faith efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| to show that they believe in this program and they think it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| But I'm out here today to ask you to support the mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| because he has the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| He has the money for that literacy component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| and that's what's going to turn Knoxville schools around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you. Appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2863)|

| 0:47:56| However, with all the testimonies of some of the other people from South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| I was born in South Knoxville, so I just want to say South Knoxville rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2880)|

| 0:48:14| So I'm invested in this community, and I'm proud of the great schools that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| I've been a part of a lot of other organizations in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| like the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| I'm on the steering committee for the Paw Gap Elementary School, the full-service community school that we've heard a little bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| and another project called Knox Achieves, which we're sending over 1,000 kids to college in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| 100 percent based on private donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| I was thinking of something driving over here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| Actually, I haven't shared this with my wife yet, but if I do the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| I've actually donated more money over the last three years to education in our community than I've actually made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| And how you do that, you take a mortgage out on your house because you believe in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| and know that our schools and our community need more investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| So I just can't turn my back on those kids knowing that they need additional help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| So anyways, I guess like they say, at breakfast the chicken has a steak in it and the pig is really vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| Like a lot of these folks in the room, I'm vested in making a difference in our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| I want to qualify that though and say, but not nearly as much as any of the teachers that I'm familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| There's so many great teachers in our community, and I know I hear the argument, and I'm sure it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| There are some of our teachers that maybe aren't up to the standards we need, but I haven't met them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| The ones that I've met are just fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| They work three, four hours past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| The ladies at the Paw Gap Community School will be there until 7 o'clock at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| three, four hours past when they're supposed to, making sure that these kids get every extra bit of help that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| So anyways, I'm here to support this budget and commitment to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| I was just thinking, oops, I'm running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| I want to jump on to just the one thing that I guess as a business person I may have some additional perspective on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| So I have 650 employees around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| We have offices in eight different countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Forty-eight percent of our employees are based here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| This is my hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| This is where I want to grow our business, but I haven't hired anybody in over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| I have staff that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| They're going to hire people where the best talent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And sad to say, in the countries that we're doing business in, the other countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| the other people are putting a bigger investment in their kids and their education than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| So long term, I'm worried that when they start making the practical business decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| they're going to be making investments in those other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Of my 650 employees, only 33 of them don't need to use a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| So we talk about not teaching technology in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| If somebody shows up at my business today without a computer literacy, they're not getting a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| So it may have been good 20 years ago, but it's not going to get a job today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| Mr. Boyd, your time's about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| Could you finish your point, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| In conclusion, I know that in your hearts, and I've talked to many of you, you know this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| And I know that if you vote for this, you're going to die on the battlefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| but I can't imagine a better battlefield to die on than for the kids of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| We're going to hear from Stephanie Ogden, then we have Susan Espiritu, and then Carla Kirkpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3071)|
| 0:51:28| So if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| I'm Stephanie Ogden, 201 Campus Lane, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| I came to Knox County Schools from a rather alternative pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| I spent 20 years at Webb School, UTK as an advocate for charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And I felt a calling to add my talents to the efforts at Knox County Schools, and that's why I came this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| The question here is really one of public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| And I will entrust it to the honor of you elected officials here present to carry your part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| and I'll talk to you about the trustworthiness of me and my colleagues at Knox County Schools for a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| First of all, I came loaded for bear with statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| I'm an old math teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| I'll spare you that because I know that as an old math teacher that often doesn't work that well anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| But I will say that since the golden days of the 60s when we had a 27% dropout rate, today it's 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| Even in 2007, Knox County Schools had a 79% graduation rate just four years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| It tops 86%, and I bet all of my colleagues back there know what our goal is, which is 93%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| Our test scores are what they are, partly because, as one of my colleagues said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| we are the country that tests and educates everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Back in the 60s, maybe the top half stayed in school long enough to get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| Now we test everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| And so that impacts test scores, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Now, you know, in 2009, we also raised the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| In 2011, we put in a new evaluation system for teachers and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| There was a time when accountability was kind of a dirty word in the schools, and that time is long gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| It's indisputable that we are demonstrably more trustworthy than ever before in public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| especially in Knox County, and this is where I want the focus of my comments to reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| I want to, instead of relying on statistics, ask you to make a mental picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| when I say the word large urban school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| The picture that came into most of your minds is most likely not Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| We are unique and special as a large urban school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| Other urban systems suffered so-called white flight in response to desegregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| It led to sort of a death spiral of contraction in resources, failing schools, urban blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| Anyone who could afford to exit publication left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Why not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Wise leaders in all segments of our society stepped up and gave a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| Mr. Webb out at Webb School, faced with a bunch of white flight influx,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| publicly chose to admit African American students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| The leaders in Knox County schools risked taking money from wealthier segments of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| and moving them to less wealthy segments of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| in order to invest in public education that benefits us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| Your time is just about up. If you could finish your point, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| My final point is I suppose that you guys now stand at a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| The question is not do we have enough faith to actually pull together and increase this energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| or are we going to just stand by while the flywheel that drives our community resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| and development actually sort of slows down, tips over, and falls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| and Knox County just becomes another large urban school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Susan Esparito, then Carla Kirkpatrick, and then Lisa Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| Good afternoon. I'm Susan Esparito, 316 Paradise Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| I'm the principal of Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I'm very proud to have been an educator since 1979. That's 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| I have been fortunate enough to witness the incredible effects of three pilot programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| that have been funded at Pond Gap during my tenure there over the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| Those projects are being looked at in the budget to go further into the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| One of those began six years ago as we were the first TAP school in the district and in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| and it has changed the way our teachers have looked at the world of teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| As with its sister model, the team evaluation system, the first year was difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| as we changed the culture of autonomous classrooms with no observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| to multiple observations and forced self-reflection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| But the culture does change, and our staff embraced the effects of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| as we saw the results in our classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| While the workload increases for the administrators and other evaluators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| an effective teacher simply learns how to reflect on their classroom teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| and continues their practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| An ineffective teacher, however, will learn how to work differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| and be more in tune with student need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| This is a good thing. It's a great thing for our students and for our profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| And this is a drastic change over the previous state model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| because it holds us all accountable to each other for our students' success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| Education has also changed for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| We cannot continue to teach students in schools the way we did 33 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| That's when I started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| They won't engage, and if they don't engage, they won't learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| A great example has happened with our second pilot this year in my fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Randy Boyd donated iPads to all my fifth grade students this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| and they were used primarily for reading, language arts, and writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| And those fifth graders had the highest writing scores in 11 years at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| They also, when the TCAP came back this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3427)|
| 0:57:17| have had the highest percentage of proficient and advanced in our fifth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| in the seven years that I've been at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Yes, there are still struggles with schools that have achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| because there are still barriers to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| So the community school strategy is our third project at Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| to be used with students and families in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| to assist in removing those barriers to learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| that prevent some of these youngest citizens from succeeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| This was also funded by a private citizen, Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| We've had tremendous success with this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| as you've seen from our accountability measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| And even though these community schools may not be placed in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| these future citizens will be in your district someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| in some capacity or another, and we want it to be a productive capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| We were studying the book of Mark yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| and the verse that we studied reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And if a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| And that verse reminded me of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Our kingdom is this school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| and your districts must not be divided against each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| or our kingdom cannot stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| So your decision is a momentous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Could you give us your final point, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| It is my final point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| The decision you're making is going to impact a generation of young citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| but the generation of citizens is our whole kingdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3518)|
| 0:58:48| Next is Carla Kirkpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| If you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| My address is 7548 Apple Cross Road, Coryton, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| and I'm a Knox County teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| and I'm here to represent the Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| And to share with you that some of the things that our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| in our school at Bellemore have seen money for are interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Two years ago, we had interventions in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| where we had six students to one teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| and we had 75 children enrolled in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| As a result of those programs, we made AYP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| We made student gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Our kids grew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| We made money to keep those student gains going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| This money would help us with tutoring in those small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| so that we can keep up those scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| An increased budget would also mean time for more teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| If we went to year-round school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| we could use the weeks off for more of that intervention time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| more educator positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| A lot of technology conversations have went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| You have to start that technology in elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| If they get to high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| and you try to throw them in a computer class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| they're not going to know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| You start that out in elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| More positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| If we had a technology teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| just like we have a P.E. teacher and an art teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| students would learn those fundamental things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| that they need on the computers to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| They would learn how to do the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| so that when they walk into a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| they're not expected to write a research paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| without knowing how to do a search on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| With technology being what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| teachers need teaching on technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| We need professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| That takes money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| We need more time in our classrooms to look at data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| to learn the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| to keep up with what the kids are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| so that we can teach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| What this comes down to is the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| It's not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| I spend more money in my classroom in one month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| than this tax is going to cause me in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| It's not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| It's about what our kids need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| It's about what Knox County students need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| to be making the gains that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| And I ask you to support this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| so that we can help them make those gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| Commissioners, it is 5.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| and I want to bring us into formal session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| And what I would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| is continue with the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| but we need to have a roll call first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| So clerk, if you'd call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3679)|

| 1:01:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3682)|

| 1:01:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3684)|

| 1:01:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| And Commissioner Anderson is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| so we expect him to be back momentarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| So we will count him as present. So all commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| Without any objection, commissioners, we'd like to continue on with our public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| and then we will go to the items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| So we have Lisa Wilkerson and then Paul DeLeon and then Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| So if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| The address is 1512 Bexhill Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| Well, first of all, I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| I'm not a teacher or a student, and I presently do not have children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| I have two sons that graduated from Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| But when they were in school, I was very actively involved as a volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| and served on many parent organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| I'm a very middle-class citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| I work full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I pay taxes on two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| And I've never stood before the Knox County Commission before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| And I don't like public speaking, so why am I here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| One of my sons struggled in school due to a reading disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| But I was there having meetings with teachers, harassing his guidance counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| and I spent more than $2,000 on testing for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| I know about the struggling student and how deeply it can affect how they perceive themselves fitting into the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| So today, I'm here to speak on behalf of those who can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| the kids who are sitting in classrooms floundering due to disabilities, a learning disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| or maybe even a poor home life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Their parents may be they probably don't have the parental support they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| Their parents may be in jail on drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| The kids themselves may be victims of abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| They may be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| There's so many situations out there that we are just not aware of that can affect the student outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| Unfortunately, their only lifeline to a better life is the community school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| And I like the concept of community schools as supported in this proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| I also like the fact that there are intervention programs for these students that would be put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| with additional personnel and tutoring provided so that they won't fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| And even if they do, they will have a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| Teachers now have packed classrooms and have so much information to squeeze into very little time before testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| They can't always stop for the few who are just not quite getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| For that matter, if the student doesn't speak up, and they usually don't because they're embarrassed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| they may not even notice until too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Extending the school year will also give teachers some additional time to teach, to tutor, and to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| These teachers need to be paid more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| We need to retain our best teachers by paying them a competitive salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| As of right now, we are providing a training ground for Oak Ridge, Maryville, and Alcoa school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| Your time is just about up, so if you could make your final point, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| They say it takes a village to raise a child, and in Knox County, you all are the village elders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| It's your responsibility to take care of not only those who speak out, but also those who can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| And you have to be wise leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| You have to be visionaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| It's been 12 years since we've had a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| It's time for the village of Knoxville to invest in her children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Next, we have Paul DeLeon, then Mike Edwards, then Mitch Steenrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| And if you would give us your address and the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Yeah, I'm at 630 Watauga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| And I've been there since 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I'm a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| I did not need a robocall to find out that there was a big decision coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| I've been to several of the board meetings and have heard a lot of the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| And so I feel I have a good understanding of the budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| I don't agree with every item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| But I can tell that it's the product of long and thoughtful deliberation by educators with long experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| So I ask you to support this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Now, I figure from the numbers that have been bandied about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| I figure it's going to cost me almost $100 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| For me, that's about three trips to the gas station or three trips to McKay's bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| It's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| But in terms of the impact that we know that it's going to have, I think it's a bargain for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| I really thank you for being such vigilant stewards of our tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| I know you don't want to waste that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| But we also depend on you to look to the future and to invest in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| And this is such a key way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| So please support the school budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4056)|
| 1:07:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Imagine yourself sitting in a hospital room in a bed, and the doctor comes in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4066)|
| 1:07:55| here's the deal, I want to take out your spleen without any anesthesia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| The answer is going to be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Imagine the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| The doctor walks in and says, you have a diseased spleen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| It's going to have to come out or you're going to suffer grave illness and will probably die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4096)|
| 1:08:26| And you say, but wait a minute, why can't you use anesthesia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| And the doctor goes, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Of course we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Where did you get that idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Of course we would use anesthesia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| Well, they told me that you wouldn't use anesthesia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| I don't know why someone would tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| That's just purely silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| Pretty similar stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| It depends on how you present the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Public education in America and in Tennessee is a diseased spleen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| In Knox County, we can cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| But if we're going to cure it, and Knox County can do things that many, many other school districts can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4149)|
| 1:09:16| certainly other urban systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| But we're going to have to have the will to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| It's going to take a total commitment from all of the leadership, all of the organizations, the churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4164)|
| 1:09:37| political stripes of all nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| It's going to take the chamber and it's going to take unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| It's going to take the tea partiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| It's going to take the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| But to wade into this, because this is not going to be doing potholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| it's going to require learning the issues, learning why, in fact, you do need this information in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| why you need technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| There's 55,000 kids in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| They need to hear from us that we're going to fix it, that the grownups are going to handle the cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4207)|
| 1:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| We'll hear from Mitch Steenrod, then we have Jim Sessions, and then David Linge, or David Ling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4220)|
| 1:10:28| So if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| My name is Mitch Steenrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| I live at 12,000 Grigsby Chapel Road, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| First and foremost, I want to thank all the honorable commissioners for the time that they have recently spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| deliberating and debating this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| I know that this is not a small means by which we are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| I understand that this is a large magnitude item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| I also understand, being chair of the Knoxville Chamber, that this could be one of the most important issues that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| address in the next decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| This is extremely, extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| I'm an executive for one of the areas' largest employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| I'm a community volunteer and an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| I'm a parent that saw three children through the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| I'm completely vested in this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| This is the beginning of a permanent and positive impact on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| The chamber and its members, and there's over 2,000 businesses that represent the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| We are not a group of elitists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| The average employees in all those chamber membership is less than 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| We represent the mass of the business community in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| They stand behind these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Many of you already know how you're going to vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Many of you understand where you stand on this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I'm going to give you some thoughts, though, as you think about that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| We've been accused of supporting this budget without an air of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| That is dead wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I know it's dead wrong because I was involved in constructing this system that will lend to measuring the outcomes of this budget request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4332)|
| 1:12:23| You will see through transparent means exactly how this budget and these dollars will help Knox County school systems perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4343)|
| 1:12:32| I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| I have worked with Gary Spencer, who worked with the Knox chamber and the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| to get this education management information system on the ground, up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| Many of you probably haven't seen firsthand what it can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Many of the naysayers don't even want to hear about it or take a step back and look at what this management information system is capable of representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4367)|
| 1:12:57| I challenge everybody that's opposed to it to get a demo, a demonstration of EMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| I also want to mention that we are fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| We're probably one of the most fortunate districts in the country to have Dr. McIntyre as our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4390)|
| 1:13:23| He is truly a visionary and does need applauded, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| I'll close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I'm running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I'm going to close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| When you get in your car tonight and you drive home and you look at your children or you think about your grandchildren and their future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| and what they can accomplish, I want you to think about how you voted tonight or what you proposed on this budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| My coaching and my encouragement to you is amend this budget and get these schools funded where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| Jim Sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| We have David Ling and then George Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And, sir, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| 3117 Foster Lane, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| I'm a retired United Methodist minister and a 35-year property owner in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| And I can be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| I'm not -- I don't have great wisdom on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I'm not a financial expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| I'm not an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| I don't have the background that so many of our speakers have had, much less the eloquence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| I simply want to thank you for all of your considerations and for your thoughtfulness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| and for listening and listening deeply to what you're hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| And I want to thank the Board of Education for bringing us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| We had two children to go through the Knox County school system K through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| We're very proud of them and the education they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| We remain deeply indebted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Decades later now to the teachers who educated them, it only makes common sense to me to support this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4496)|
| 1:15:06| to support these schools, to support the vision that these people have, that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| that we share together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| We're one family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| We're one family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| In my religious faith, we're brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| These children are all of our children, not just some of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| We support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| With no expertise, it's simply common sense to me that without supporting this budget, we're short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4531)|
| 1:15:40| We give short shrift to our community, and we shortchange our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| We pray that you will be thoughtful, look to the future, don't be short-sighted, and support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4545)|
| 1:15:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| Next, we have David Ling or Lingy, and I want to make sure I get your name correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| David Lingy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| And then George Hamilton and then Brian Moneyhun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| So, sir, if you could give us your name or address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, I live at 929 Eleanor Street in the Fourth and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| I've lived there for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| I have no children in the educational system here at present, but my two daughters graduated from Knox County High Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4580)|
| 1:16:29| I taught religious studies at the University of Tennessee for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| I'm here to urge members of the commission to vote in favor of this expanded budget for the Knox County School System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4593)|
| 1:16:44| I'm here to urge you to do that because I deeply believe that real prosperity in any community has its foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| in a strong educational system, and we need to strengthen ours if we want to be more prosperous than we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4612)|
| 1:17:02| Several years ago, I read an article in the Toronto Globe and Mail, one of the major newspapers in Toronto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| The article had to do with a decision made by an automobile manufacturing company that was looking for a site for a new plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| It looked at several sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| One was in our neighboring state of Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| It was in the vicinity of Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| The other was in Ontario, and the Ontario site won, and the plant was built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4646)|
| 1:17:35| When the auto executives made that decision, they were contacted by the development officers from the state of Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4655)|
| 1:17:44| who asked for an interview with them to find out why Alabama had lost this manufacturing plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4664)|
| 1:17:51| which would have yielded many good-paying jobs for people in Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| And the answer they got was that the company was concerned about the competence and stability of its workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| and they felt that Ontario was a better place to settle and build their plant for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| One had to do with the health care system of the United States as opposed to Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| But equally important, they said, was the fact that the Ontario town, which I believe was Kingston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| had a superior educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| So I take exception to the gentleman who spoke earlier and identified himself as a member of the Tea Party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4706)|
| 1:18:33| by saying a strong educational system and a government that is willing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| and a population willing to invest in that educational system is going to get the good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| Voting against this increased budget, which will improve our educational opportunities for our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| voting against that budget is guaranteeing that we will get low-wage jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| rather than jobs that mean real prosperity that enable workers in our community to raise their families with real dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4739)|
| 1:19:08| The choice, it seems to me, that we're making here is a choice as to whether we want low-wage jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| whether we want low-wage jobs in our community or good-paying jobs to support our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| Your time is up, sir, if you could finish your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4762)|
| 1:19:32| Next, we have George Hamilton, then Brian Moneyhun, then Joe Bryson, and then Rebecca Fogarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| And, sir, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| My name is George Hamilton, 2812 Greenway Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918-1946, and they don't use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4782)|
| 1:19:56| The reason you're here tonight is because these people that put you in office do not trust your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4796)|
| 1:20:05| That's plain and simple, because as far as I'm concerned, there's not a dummy on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| And I know you know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Now, you can be influenced, but I started substitute teaching when I was 65 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4815)|
| 1:20:23| The average grown man is petrified to even be around a school, much less go in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| And I found it a piece of cake, because kids have always been the same, whether the ... I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4831)|
| 1:20:39| But anyway, you're overdoing the school system, and you're overdoing the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4839)|
| 1:20:51| I called Kay today at 594-1620.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| The girl knows everything in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| And the curriculum in Knox County schools will blow your mind, and I don't care who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4857)|
| 1:21:05| It'll blow your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| You'll think he's going to Notre Dame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| And what you need to do is get real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Grasscutters do not need algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| Those truck drivers that blow by you on the interstate, they don't need algebra, geometry, trigonometry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| You are here today, like I said, because they don't trust your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| But just throwing money at the school system is not a cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4892)|
| 1:21:39| And I know this very well, that America was made great by people with seventh-grade educations, not UT graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4899)|
| 1:21:51| We won World War II and done the atomic bomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| Now, all of us didn't have to know how to make an atomic bomb, just a very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| And time goes fast, don't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| Clog, if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4927)|
| 1:22:23| Y'all have fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| Well, Mr. Hamilton, thank you so much for entertaining us and giving us a little levity here as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4951)|
| 1:22:43| Brian Moneyhun, then Joe Bryson, and then Rebecca Fogarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| If you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| My name is Brian Moneyhun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| I live at 5512 Dogwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| And, sir, you are a hard man to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| I would like to thank the commission for their consideration on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| I would like to thank Dr. McIntyre for all of his efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| And I would like to thank the mayor for his efforts as well and all the school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| I'm not here to pick a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| I'm not here to be against technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| I think that technology is the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| And we will all see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Twenty years from now, we will teach our children in a very different way than we are currently doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| I am just saying that in this year, 2012, I do not believe that we can burden the Knox County taxpayer at this time this much more than we are already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5016)|
| 1:23:50| I will let everyone else have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| And thank you all for showing up, no matter which side of this issue you're on, because you all care, every one of you, no matter what your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5034)|
| 1:24:04| Look around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| See how crowded this room is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| And I bet we all know four or five people that could have been here that didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Joe Bryson, Rebecca Fogarty, and then, I believe, Fran Ansley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Joe Bryson, 505 Longview, Knoxville, 3Z919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| First of all, I'd like to say I'm glad to see the entire commission is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Welcome back, Mr. Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Folks, I want to take a moment and talk about just two simple things, good faith and reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5073)|
| 1:24:41| This is a tough place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| The tough decisions are made right here with you people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Churchill said this is where reality and expectations meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Right here, rubber meets the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| Good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| You know the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| The polls are overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| They're opposed to these tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| You know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Enough with the polls, enough ad nauseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| But that's the way the people feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Dr. Briggs made a comment the other day that there's unintended collateral damage to many businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Today on the radio, I heard Bill Jones, a local businessman, say he is spending $40,000 a year property tax on a building that he has to keep for his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5110)|
| 1:25:20| And his wife and he are they put $700,000 into the business to try to keep it afloat, to keep employment going in Knoxville out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5120)|
| 1:25:29| He hopes that nothing else happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| He's afraid this bump might be enough to bump him out of Knox County or bump his business out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| Good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| I said reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Tacitus said that no expectation of benefit gives you the right not to apply reason today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| Today, reason demands we do not put a tax increase in the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5149)|
| 1:25:59| I want to thank you folks, those for and against us, my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| Thank Mr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| You people are really going through a very tough thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| You came to serve and you're serving well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| However you decide, the people await.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Just remember that people have an expectation of good faith and reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| Rebecca Forgetty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| It's 3409 Ben Alder Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| I live in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I was born and raised in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Grew up in the Halls community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I moved to the Carnes when I married my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| I respectfully request that you decline to support the school board's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| requesting $35 million additional dollars above the budget outlined by Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| Granting their request will place a heavy tax burden on everyone in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| It places a heavy tax burden on small businesses, property and homeowners, and ultimately those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| that rent from them, as the tax increase will trickle down to those that rent from property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| Everyone in Knox County will be affected by the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| We cannot afford to fund a multi-million dollar budget right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| I personally do not see the accountability for my additional tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| I know we keep talking about transparency and accountability, and I've failed to see where the accountability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| My family owns a home, and we will personally be affected by the increased property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| Like so many others in Knox County, my family operates on a tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| We recently had a $15 increase in our mortgage per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| That increase doesn't sound like a whole lot to a lot of you, but due to that increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| that meant that we had to cut back in other areas of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| Additionally, I see small businesses in our community that are struggling already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| We look around and we see empty commercial property, we see empty storefronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5279)|
| 1:28:07| That's not going to change by placing a higher tax burden on these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| If anything, it's going to make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| You know, I'm tired of driving through town and every corner there's an empty office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| How do we remedy that? Do we remedy that by placing a higher tax burden on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| I understand that the school board does have good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| I'm not against education. I am for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| I am for teaching our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Unfortunately, the way that we're going to get increased test scores and education for our children is with parental involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5316)|
| 1:28:44| No amount of technology and no amount of money is going to replace parental involvement in our students' educations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| They are full of good intentions. I see that, but I ask that you keep in mind that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| In case you're wondering, we have 12 people remaining, and so we want to hear from those as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5338)|
| 1:29:10| So I believe this is Fran Ansley, and then we have Carol Nickel, and then Josh Smizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5350)|
| 1:29:20| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Yes, I live at 3117 Foster Lane in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| I'm here as a senior citizen whose children graduated from Knox County Schools years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5370)|
| 1:29:38| and I'm here as a property owner in Knox County, a taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| and I want to say that I am ready to pay a modest tax increase for something this important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5383)|
| 1:29:56| What I feel like I cannot afford as a senior resident of this community is a starved school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| an uneducated workforce, and the weakened democracy and debilitated economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| that are the inevitable results of starved educational systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| This is really a historic moment for our county, at least I feel this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| I've been here a long time, and in my memory, I don't remember a mobilization of this kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| a real energetic mobilization stretching from the grassroots right up to the treetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| with people standing up and saying yes, yes to children, yes to the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5433)|
| 1:30:41| yes to a community where education is valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| The mood of this pro-schools mobilization has been forward-looking, positive, generous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5445)|
| 1:30:55| and civically engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Now, this is exactly the kind of mood that elected officials surely should crave and nourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| I assume that is a mood that you all crave and want to nourish, and for this reason, if no other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| I hope you will think carefully before you would vote no on increased support for the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| It would represent, I believe, a real setback in the climate, not only for our public education system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| but also for the overall weather of civic life in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| and I hope you'll not inflict that kind of a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| Am I saying that this is an easy decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| For you all, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| There are genuine issues, and heck, even fake issues are difficult in the middle of a disinformation campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| Am I saying that this will solve all the problems of Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5501)|
| 1:31:53| Of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| These problems are serious, and many of them are rooted in much deeper social and economic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| that must be faced, irrespective of what you do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| Am I saying that the school system should get a blank check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Heck, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| I'm an active member of Jobs with Justice of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| a group that recently involved itself in standing beside Knox County school custodians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| in their fight to defeat a proposal to contract out their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| Your time is about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| Could you wrap it up for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| I think I've said what I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| Carol Nichol, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| My address is 722 Luttrell Street in a home that I bought in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| And I'm here as a senior citizen and a grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Although my grandchildren go to school in North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| I'm here because I believe very strongly that the future of our Knox County community lies with our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5573)|
| 1:33:05| And the future of our children depends on the quality of their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| It is extremely important, I think, that this commission make the right decision tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| and support the Knox County educators that are striving so hard to give the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| in our community quality education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| I urge you to support the Knox County School Board proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5608)|
| 1:33:39| Next we have Josh Smizer and then Ann Barnett and then James Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| And, sir, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| I live at 1738 Clinch Avenue, Apartment 3, which is in the first district, zip code 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| I'm a custodian with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| And I'm here today to ask you to make what unfortunately seems to be a really unpopular decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| and there's quite a bit of controversy and hyperbole surrounding it as we've heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| I'm asking that you act today to give the school system the funding that it desperately needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| by adopting the budget presented to you by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| There's an employee I see every day that me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| and the school system are doing quite a bit with very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| I see teachers, secretaries, and custodians, the people that I interact with every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| working like very long hours and doing a whole lot more than they're actually paid to do simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| because they see that it's a necessary part of educating the kids in this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| I think that it is absolutely necessary that to adequately educate the children of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5677)|
| 1:34:45| and adequately compensate the employees who support that education, more money is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| I think you cannot say that that's not, you know, unavoidably the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| And the situation today is that it's simply unjust to ask the school employees to do more work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| with the same compensation and with the same very, very limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| High standards are set by the school administration and the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| for all school employees from the bottom to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| And I think if the commission and the citizens of this county wish to uphold these high standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| which they do, they must help us meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| This year the commission has the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| It can do its part and show its commitment to our schools by allocating the needed resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| to the school system where it can choose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| I think either of these options will be popular with some, obviously, and unpopular with some, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| But only one of them is, I actually believe, the smart and the just one for our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| and for the county as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| Ann Barnett, then James Arthur, then Nick Ciparo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| I'm Ann Barnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| My address is 904 Lester Street, 37920 Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| Not in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| I am standing here as a Jobs with Justice member, as a recently newlywed in the process of buying my first home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5761)|
| 1:36:09| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| I'm here to urge you to pass a budget that includes the money requested by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| For me, first and foremost, this is not about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| It's about values and what our community values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| And this community values good education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| We value strong schools that provide kids with inspiration and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| And we value institutions that honor those committed to providing quality education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| by paying them livable wages and giving them good benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| What we don't value is our schools that are in constant deficits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| that are pinching pennies and cutting corners to make ends meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| pitting art classes against math classes, new science equipment against new football equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| that shift the blame then for failing students onto the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| and try to balance the budget on the backs of the workers by outsourcing their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| and cutting their wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| That want to close small schools to consolidate students into mega schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| This is not what we value as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| And if we don't pass this budget, this is the situation that we're going to be facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| as is evidenced by the attempts that happened already to outsource the custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5840)|
| 1:37:28| And so as a small aside, I just want to say that my husband and I are both recent grads of UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| We will be hopefully buying our first house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| We're newlyweds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| We're struggling to find decent jobs in this job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| So needless to say, we're poor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| We're poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| But yet I'm standing here saying that I am willing to pay money to support strong schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5867)|
| 1:37:59| So why am I saying this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| Because my mom taught me that if we want nice things, we have to pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5882)|
| 1:38:12| So I just want to, again, urge you to pass a budget that includes the school board request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| My name is James Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| I'm vice chair of the Knoxville Tea Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| I live in Anderson County, but I'm here representing the Tea Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| You still want my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| It's 100 Delmar Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| We're here to endorse the mayor's plan because we feel that it offers a very substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| and responsible increase in the school funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Mind you, we very much support school funding and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| We don't believe that this plan makes things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| That's one problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| There's no question of the value of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| It's valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| But we don't feel that the reason that kids aren't learning today is technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| or is going to be fixed with technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| Every generation until now has learned to read without iPads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| And the fact that they're having trouble learning to read suggests there's another problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| that's not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| So if we focus our energy and attention without solving the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| we feel that's not the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| Another point is we don't accept the premise that when we increase the tax percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5974)|
| 1:39:41| that's a permanent increase in taking part of what people earn and own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| We don't accept the premise that education has suddenly gotten more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| and more arduous to where it needs to be a bigger burden on everyone in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| We just don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| As you know from your e-mails and public comments and polls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| two-thirds of Knoxville is opposed to the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| We absolutely support education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| That's not the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| We just don't think this is the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| And lastly, we understand some civic-minded citizens in favor of the superintendents' budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6017)|
| 1:40:26| offered you all 500 apples this morning, which was very nice with nice labels on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6026)|
| 1:40:35| So we have brought you 10 lemons because this is what the citizens have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| And there are 11 commissioners, and there are only 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| So unfortunately, you're going to have to make it work like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| May we suggest lemonade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| It's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| We have Nick Ciparo, then Michael Conrad, then Christopher Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6061)|
| 1:41:12| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| I guess I'll state my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| 1100 Gertrude, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| And I came here today to ask for a vote, not your vote, but our vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| to let us, the citizens of Knox County, vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| As is, in an unelected administration, well, basically has put us in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| We, the voters, should be voting yes or no on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| this tax hike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| The administration has let the cat out of the bag by saying that operating costs is $1 million a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| yet are only open for 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| Simple math shows that the current $420 million budget is a lot more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| $240 million more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| Sounds like math should be taught to the administration as well as the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| And I ask again, let us vote as a congressional candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Michael Conrad, then Christopher Cook, and then Lonnie Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| 605 Hickory Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| I'm here today to talk about the Knox County school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| There's a lot of things that these kids that they talk about having technology, technology, technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| Well, there's a lot of these kids out here that don't, can't do the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| And there's a, instead you learn it when you're young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Knox County School let my son down on the technology end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| and he's a very good construction engineer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| Construction out here, I get people every day from the University of Tennessee that has graduated from the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| Tennessee that can't get a job because they know too much technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| They can't go out here and work with their hands, build anything, do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6197)|
| 1:43:23| But they still come and apply for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| I work them about a week, and I have to get rid of them because they just don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| I think the school needs to put back into force like I was taught in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| I had a great teacher, Mr. Heck, best teacher I ever met in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| He taught wood shop, and he really taught me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| I own a cabinet business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| I own a cabinet shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| I own a remodeling business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| I work a lot of Knox Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| But these people need to learn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| So the other day, y'all was talking about raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| Well, I live in a house, and I pay my taxes every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| So I got to wondering, well, how does the property assessor assess how much I pay on taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| So I went and had my house appraised, and I suggested everybody in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| and in the city of Knoxville does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| I am being charged three times what my appraisal is on my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| But if I sold that house tomorrow, this is all I could sell it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| 2008, we hit the crunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| All housing went down 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Everybody's home values went down 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| We're selling $350,000 homes for $250,000, but we're being taxed on $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6283)|
| 1:44:52| I'm looking for a tax reduction, not an increase in my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| I think this school is doing good, but they need to look at the people that can't do the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| You have a very small percentage of Knox County students that go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| Most of them are out here in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| That's what they need to be learning, because we're going to one day, we're going to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| and everybody's going to say, technology, technology, technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| But when it comes down to it, who's going to build these buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Who's going to build our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| I mean, what kids are going to be doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| We need to have a vocational training center built for these kids that can't do the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| and quit worrying about getting them into college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Sir, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| There's a lot of kids that don't go to college, and I work a lot of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| because they could not make it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| They wasn't taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| They need to be taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| And as far as the tax goes, no, I don't want an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| I'm already paying three times the amount my house is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| Why would I want to pay more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6362)|

| 1:46:14| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Forgive me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| Mr. Shouse knows me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Can we get your address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| 9120 Robinwood Road, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| I moved here in 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| I'll soon be 62 years old within days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| Very shortly thereafter, Mr. Shouse and I worked at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| I had an opportunity to meet him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| Frankly, I've been sitting here next to Dr. McIntyre praying for what I would say to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6408)|
| 1:47:01| I am definitely in support of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| I'm not sure that this is the right method that we need to reach that particular means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6426)|
| 1:47:17| Tonight for you as our county commissioners to search your heart and your soul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6437)|
| 1:47:25| and those of your neighbors and friends to look for maybe another means of sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6445)|
| 1:47:38| Maybe increase property taxes, not 19 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| Maybe increasing sales tax to as much as 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| There's not a fairer tax that we can have in this state than a consumption-based tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6469)|
| 1:47:59| And I don't care to go on record of being willing to pay 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| which is the maximum allowable in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| If you don't spend the money, you don't pay the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| It's a difficult thing that you'll have to decide today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| And frankly, I do not envy your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| But I ask that you do look at potential alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| I haven't worked in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| I'm 62 years old, and nobody will even talk to me about a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| I need a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| The economy, as this gentleman just stated, a few years ago our housing did drop 25 percent in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6522)|
| 1:48:54| That does make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| Fortunately, mine has not dropped 66 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| But people in Florida are lucky to get 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| And I thank you for the time you've shared with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| Please consider a combined method of funding what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| I am not in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6556)|

| 1:49:29| First of all, I want to congratulate the superintendent for getting all of his employees out here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| It seems that we have an abundance of teachers and principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| And I appreciate their point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| But I'd like to give you another point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| In 1970, it cost $55,000, on average, in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| to educate a child from kindergarten through 12th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| In inflation-adjusted dollars, we are currently spending $155,000 per student for the same education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6597)|
| 1:50:08| except it's a worse education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| The three main indicators of a quality education are language, math, and science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6611)|
| 1:50:20| In the last 40 years, the language and the math have stayed pretty close to the same that it was then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6620)|
| 1:50:29| They're down a little, but not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| Science, however, has gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Now, I refuse to believe that our children are any dumber than the kids were 40 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6634)|
| 1:50:42| And maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Maybe they are dumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Mine aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| But maybe some of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| But that, you know, that only leaves one other component here, and that would be the educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| And, you know, if we look, we had another introduction of technology into the school system many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| Let me back up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| And when I was in college, the curriculum that I was in, if they caught you with a calculator in that curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| you were booted out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| You were told to use a slide rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| You need to know where this comes from, how you get to your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| So we allowed calculators in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| Now, how many of you have gone to restaurants or anyplace else or a grocery store or whatever and asked for change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| and the individual you're dealing with can't make change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| It's because they relied on the calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Are we going to rely on a computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Our children are born with the best computer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| It's a bio computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| It's called a brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| You know, what we need to do is develop that brain the same way we did 40, 60, 80 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| We had real good results with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| I don't know why all of a sudden we have to have these new situations occur that require more expenditure of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6717)|
| 1:52:07| We're already spending 60 percent of our county budget on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| When is enough enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| There's an old saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| If you keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, that's a sign of insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| I read an article recently in one of the science magazines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| It said in India they had developed an electronic platform which would allow them to teach their children using electronics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6744)|
| 1:52:34| like an iPad, only you didn't have access to the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| I don't know why you need that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Sir, your time is about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| But if you've got books, you've got the information, put it on software, put it on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| those things cost them $21 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| My daddy always said, follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I think we need to follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| Hela Nelson, then Andy Andrew, then John Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| And your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| My name is Kelly Nelson, 7505 Glen Arden Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| First, let me say that I've always believed all my life that teachers deserve one of the highest salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| you could give them over other people in America, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| But you're not going to like what I have to say for the rest of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| First, I think a burden at this time of more taxes on any of the people is going to be destructive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| especially to the elderly that are living on a fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| Most of our community now is going into the baby boomers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| So you're going to affect a lot of people if you raise taxes with all of these taxes you have on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| But the real problem I see today is with the Skinnerian Pavlovian dog training of our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| rather than the teaching that once graced our excellent schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| C.S. Lewis said, when training beats education, civilization dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Let me say this is not the teacher's fault, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| The teachers are our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| In 1934, the Carnegie Corporation said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| we are going to use the schools to change the U.S. from a free market system to a planned economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| In a planned economy, as in communist countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| the administration chooses at an early age what your child will do all through their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| In many states, they're now making the children choose in fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| In 1958, the first U.S. Soviet education agreement was signed under President Eisenhower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| Many others have followed, including the general agreement between the U.S. Soviets on education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| signed by Reagan in 85 and 88 at Geneva and Moscow, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| We also now have a U.S.-Red China education agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| The Soviet system of education includes the Pavlovian method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| which is now being used across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| It was recommended by William Foster, former chairman of the Communist Party USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| in his 1930 book, Toward a Soviet America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| The late Professor Benjamin Bloom, internationally known behaviorist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| the father of Pavlovian, Skinnerian mastery learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| and outcomes-based education, told us in his book, Taxonomy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| and these are important quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| the purpose of education was to change the thoughts, actions, and feelings of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| and an hour of classroom activity could bring about a major reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| in attitudes, values, and beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| He defined good teaching as challenging the students' fixed ideals, virtues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| and beliefs taught by their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| B.F. Skinner said, I could make a pigeon a high achiever by reinforcing it on a proper schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6960)|
| 1:56:08| and operant conditioning shapes behavior as a sculpture shapes a lump of clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| Ma'am, your time is about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| My kids aren't a lump of clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| Charlotte Isserby is a former senior policy advisor in the Reagan administration department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| Sixty percent of our NAEP tests today are attitudinal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| They are not research and development for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| Please vote and support the mayor's budget and against these taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| We have Andy Andrew and then John Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| Also, if Jessica Holman has come in, we did not hear from her or David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| So if they're here, we'll be happy to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| So, sir, if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| I live at 712 Summit Lake Court, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| I am here this afternoon to support the one budget which represents all Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7026)|
| 1:57:13| in a responsible manner that is fiscally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| I compliment Mayor Burchett for including significant additional funding for the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7037)|
| 1:57:25| of a good education, particularly apparently needed augmentation for the reading program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7045)|
| 1:57:35| We can all stipulate that we are in favor of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| I was not sure how to address this subject today when Charlie Daniel came to my rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| in this morning's cartoon with regard to some graphics with regard to where we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7067)|
| 1:57:55| and where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Look at it in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Where we are today, we need to be paying more attention to lining up the fundamental building blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7079)|
| 1:58:07| on which good education is based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| What's this perception of where we need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| Examine that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| It is a physical impossibility, an optical illusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| If we are to brag about being visionaries, we need to base those visions on sound fundamentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7101)|
| 1:58:31| In this case, reading, writing, and arithmetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| You folks have to consider both sides of this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| We would all like to make more money available for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| but you have the fiscal responsibility to the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| It is your responsibility to take into consideration the frail economic times we are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7129)|
| 1:58:58| This is not the time to put additional taxation or additional debt on the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7138)|
| 1:59:06| Get back to the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| The rest of it will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| I strongly encourage you to support the mayor's plan with regard to this education issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7151)|
| 1:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7158)|

| 1:59:45| Some of you are smiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| You know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| This is to address the people on this panel as well as the people, most of them, behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| There's a thing going on in the United States today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| It's called a recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| Some of the people in the education think that is a vicious rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7202)|

| 2:00:22| They're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| You get in a situation where you don't think about what affects something that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7225)|
| 2:00:32| The education bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| The education bill right now is not supposed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| There's not supposed to be a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Remember the will tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| There was no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| We're going to double the will tax, and it will fix education forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| We threw money at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| It didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| When you throw money at it, it won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| Then the money went in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| Today, we go to double the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| It goes in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| That's just the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Several years ago when I was making what they referred to in my profession as the long dollar, I didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| God having a sense of humor, I had two heart attacks, four bypasses, congestive heart failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7278)|
| 2:01:30| and a lung that decided, I quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| You haven't taken care of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| I ain't going to take care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| No, I cannot work anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| I'm making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| What I'm doing, I'm making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| I've got a little coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| You raise my property taxes, I will have lost my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| I am that short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| What some of the people need to do behind me is start dealing with the have and have nots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| instead of associating with the have and have lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| Is Jessica Holman or David Williams here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7328)|
| 2:02:15| Those are all the people that we have signed up to speak on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7335)|

| 2:02:55| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| Ten of our 11 commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| I expect Mr. Brown will be here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| Commissioners, we have three people who had signed up to speak on transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| and we had said that if and when that time came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| if there was an amendment to the budget, that we would allow them the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| However, because they are here on public transportation, if they don't speak now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| they will have to leave and not be possibly afforded that opportunity because of the way the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| So if it's all right with you, we'd like to hear from these three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Let them give them the opportunity to speak on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| and then we're going to get started with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| So with no objection, I'd like to call on Catherine Moore, Sandy Boer, and Nicole Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7408)|
| 2:03:47| Catherine Moore, Sandy Boer, and Nicole Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7433)|
| 2:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7464)|
| 2:04:43| Thank you for being here, and if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| Catherine Moore, 900 East Hill Avenue, Suite 120, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| We appreciate this opportunity, and as I've been listening to all the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| I understand that we are here to ask for more tax, property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| However, it is just a penny, and as I do support the education proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7506)|
| 2:05:14| I am also in support of Commissioner Broyle's one-cent property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7514)|
| 2:05:22| And these two really go together, and let me explain quickly why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| I was a single mom for years with two kids in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| I took them to the library, to field trips, and to different school activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| And the only way they could get there is by us using public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| Now I work, and public transportation lends me the opportunity to go back and forth to my job where I make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7541)|
| 2:05:49| And I put that back into our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| I'm a homeowner, and I am very willing for my property tax to go up for the schools and for public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| Many seniors have talked here, and part of the million dollars that's going to be raised through this one-cent property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7560)|
| 2:06:08| this will also enable them to get back and forth easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| and not cost them as much as paying for gasoline as they can use the senior ride-free program through CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7572)|
| 2:06:20| So that would help with their finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| I would quickly like to say, just really quick in support of the education system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| I've only heard one person talk about the cost that teachers spend on their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| I have two daughters that are teachers, and believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| they spend hundreds of dollars every year in their classroom just for their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| And I would like for small business owners to think of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| I understand their taxes will be raised, but the teachers are already spending hundreds of dollars out of their own pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| to give the students what they need for their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| So please, as you vote for the property tax, I know that Commissioner Boyce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| we are asking for one more cent, one more cent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| But this also goes along with our enhancement of our lives, our quality of our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| a chance to participate in the community on the equal level as everyone else gets to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| We are taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| We own our own homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| We participate in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| So this is a very important decision for all of us to better our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| Sandy Boor, then Nicole Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7655)|
| 2:07:50| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| My name is Sandra Boor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| I live at 7913 Gleason Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| I would also like to speak in favor of the transportation bill and the one-cent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7679)|
| 2:08:05| I've been a taxpayer property owner for 25 years, and I've paid my taxes for that long in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7685)|
| 2:08:13| and I feel that it would definitely be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| Without public transportation, I would not have been able to go to the University of Tennessee and get a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| I would not be able to have gotten a job and to have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| Now I am retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| And I'd like to say that today's 60 is yesterday's 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| So now I'm ready to go, and I can't do it without public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| And I also would like to speak for the schools in support of that because my children are grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| but now I have grandchildren, which has happened when your children get married and have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| I had four sons graduate from Bearden, and I had one son graduate from Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| and they had to use public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| And I would just like to see their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| But like I say, I have a bunch of grandchildren now, and they go to various schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| All of them are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| And I would just like to speak in support of both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| Nicole Anderson, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Nicole Anderson, and it's 7823 Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7763)|
| 2:09:31| And I work at the Disability Resource Center, so I'm speaking on behalf of transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7771)|
| 2:09:36| not only for myself but other people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| And finding affordable, accessible transportation is a large part of everyday life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| I have noticed the trend in services such as CAC and ETHRA to restrict their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7791)|
| 2:10:00| providing rides for medical appointments, which limits the transportation options of a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7800)|
| 2:10:10| And here is something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| Knox County has over 70,000 individuals who are disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| while the total population of the county is over 300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| If more people were able to get out in the community to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7825)|
| 2:10:32| Knox would be a more active and vibrant city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| And at the same time, improved transportation would allow people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| to have increased opportunities in the job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| And I myself rely on public transportation to get to work every day and social events with friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7846)|
| 2:10:56| in addition to doing grocery shopping and other necessary daily activities of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| And I would be able to that I use public transportation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| and I am in support of the one-cent tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| which would help not only me but other people who rely on public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7883)|
| 2:11:30| Now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment I'm sure that many of you have been waiting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| that is the agenda items where we discuss the items that we have on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| This is the time now where we as commissioners will be discussing the items that are brought forward on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| We will be making motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| And at that point, each commissioner will have the opportunity to express views, ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| We normally have a five-minute rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| We're going to have our five-minute clock here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| But this is a very, very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| So we're going to give commissioners a bit of a leeway in terms of making points or asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| I would ask that the audience, you've been outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| And I really appreciate your cooperation in terms of the way that you have conducted yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| And we want to conduct ourselves in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| So we're asking that you please refrain from any remarks, et cetera, as we are making our remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7934)|
| 2:12:22| and as we are debating these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| As you might imagine, as with you, there are differences of opinion on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| But that doesn't mean that we don't love Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| It doesn't mean that we don't want the best for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| It's just that we have the opportunity to discuss and vote on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| And we will do that in a respectful and a deliberate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| I want to say to each commissioner, thanks to each of you for the work that you have done on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| We have spent many hours on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| I think that you have conducted yourselves extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| And I know that you will cast your votes according to the way that you feel would be in the best interest of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| establishing a general county budget and making appropriations from the several funds for departments, institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| offices, and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| and ending June 30, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| and approving the organizational chart of the executive branch of Knox County Government 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| I would move that the mayor's budget is presented, the consolidated budget is presented by the mayor be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| I have a substitute motion that I would like to bring forward if that would be appropriate at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8017)|
| 2:13:45| One of the things that I have tried to do, ladies and gentlemen of the commission and in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8025)|
| 2:13:51| is to try to do my due diligence with regards to each of the items that have come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| With regards to this one, I have visited over 20 schools, have talked with a number of people by phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| have heard from many of you, and I apologize to those of you that I haven't been able to speak with directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| But as you might imagine, we've had a number of people who have called and a number of e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| And so I wanted to try to get back to each of you, but I've just not been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| It doesn't mean that I'm not interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| It's just that it was a time factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| What I would like to do is to present to you an alternative budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| And not really an alternative budget, but just an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| This is an amendment which is not the amendment that we discussed the other day at our workshop session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8069)|
| 2:14:36| But this is a budget amendment which basically recognizes the mayor's $3 million that he has committed to early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8076)|
| 2:14:44| And I want to commend the mayor for appropriating those funds for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| and to recognize the need to put an emphasis on early literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| as well as the additional funds that he has put in his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| When you look at the request that was made by the schools, approximately $28 million of that was for what we call technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8097)|
| 2:15:08| and for renovations to various schools, upgrades and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| That would be $28 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| There's no question in my mind, having visited New Hopewell and having visited Gibbs High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| and having visited most of the, if not all of the schools there, that they're in need of repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8119)|
| 2:15:26| The question is, is do we do it now or do we try to address it later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| What I am putting forward in terms of a motion is that the schools that asked for an additional $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8131)|
| 2:15:41| to go into the classroom and to continue with improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| $3 million of that has already been committed by our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| I'm suggesting that we provide $4 million for the other means that have been listed in the school's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8149)|
| 2:15:59| which would provide for hiring additional teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| And I have passed out a sheet which, again, this is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| This is just to reiterate what we had seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| With providing the additional teachers, restoring teacher positions at Farragut, Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| Austin East and South Doyle High School, providing professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| providing some additional funds for the Magnet School, providing for intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| which would provide some with our literacy program, which the mayor has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| But it would also give us some enrichment activities, which we had talked about, robotics teams, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| and arts for the summer program, but also with regards to community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| When I attended Pond Gap and we had that meeting at Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| I came away extremely impressed with the results that they're getting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| because they are literally changing lives with what is going on with this community schools concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| What this would do is it would allow the community schools concept to go to three more schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| So I'm proposing a substitute motion that an additional $4 million be allocated to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8217)|
| 2:17:06| The way we would pay for that is we believe that we will get an additional million dollars in anticipated BEP funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8226)|
| 2:17:13| We would take $1.5 million from Knox County's general fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| and $1.5 million from the school's balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| So we would basically split the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| I'm also suggesting that at this point we do not attempt to fund the technology or the renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| or the building programs, which would be approximately $28 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| but that we have further discussion on that over the course of the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| and that we look at how we could best serve technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| This would not require a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| Let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| We've heard from our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| We have heard from our individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| This is something that has become quite a lightning rod along with the iPads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| I have talked with our schools about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| I've talked with our interim finance director about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| And so I am prepared to make this as a substitute motion that this be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| and an amendment to the mayor's proposed budget that there be $4 million in additional funds for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| specifically earmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| We will be able to measure the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| We will be able to track this as we go forward between now and this is a one-year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| But we would take out the technology portion and we would take out the building portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| So I would like to make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| So let's begin with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Do you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| I had an idea, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Do you want to vote on yours before I do mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| What do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| Well, we have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| If it fails, then we can always go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| Well, can we not hear from the other ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| Is that appropriate, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| I think if we have a motion on the floor, we should only be discussing the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| I mean, I'm not trying to blame you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| I want to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| For $5, I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| If we could, let's go ahead and dispose of this because I don't know how the body feels about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| And so we may go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| Another point of order question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| If it fails and then people come back around to this idea and think it's better than the other ones we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| I'd like us to suspend the rules, have a discussion about everybody's idea if it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| And that way we know which plan that we like the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| I want to make sure we're appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| Is that appropriate, Mr. Law Director, to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| In order to suspend the rules, you'll require a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| Eight commissioners would have to vote in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| So we have a motion to suspend the rules, to hear other proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| Again, we'll need to roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| We will need eight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Can I ask a question before I vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| We can have a discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| You've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| And we can hear what Commissioner Smith has to say if we vote to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8393)|
| 2:20:01| But which one do we end up voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| We will vote on my proposal because that's the one that's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| So I just wanted to be sure it was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| That's the only motion you'd have on the floor, but you're just allowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| So let's begin with a roll call vote in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| Again, eight members to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8427)|
| 2:20:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| The vote is 10-1 to suspend the rules, and so we will hear other proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| Commissioner Smith, do you have one you'd like to bring forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| You all think you're nervous out there, let me tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| It doesn't get any easier up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Commissioners, I have for some of you that may be on the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| and may not know how you want to vote, I think I'd like to shed some light on our school budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8456)|
| 2:21:04| That's basically all I want to talk about is a school budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| First, I want to thank everybody for over 2,000 phone calls, e-mails, face-to-face conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8467)|
| 2:21:15| And, Dr. McIntyre, if you will, next year remind me to add more minutes to my cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| I went over this month just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| I also got a red light, a $50 ticket for talking to a constituent going through a red light on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8482)|
| 2:21:28| So it's been intense, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| It's been intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| But we really appreciate everybody that has come through and has talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| My six years on commission, I've never seen anything like this in the support that the community has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| Dr. McIntyre, I especially want to thank you for your personal phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| and the face-to-face meetings with you, the school tours and the meetings with the principals and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| And many of them are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| I know you on a first-name basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| I mean, you're my friends, and I appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| And, Dr. McIntyre, I want to tell you that you have run a very intense, professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| and informative campaign and seeking to seek your additional $35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| My hat is off to your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8528)|
| 2:22:16| You all have run a very impressive and professional campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| I have a business concept plan that I'd like to get to Dr. McIntyre and your items that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| And it doesn't require giving the taxpayers any permanent tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| It's nothing new in the world of economics or corporate American budget balancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| Commissioners, school board members, ladies and gentlemen in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| the county is $1 billion in debt counting our interest, $1 billion in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8557)|
| 2:22:45| According to Chris Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| and school board figures for the 2012 and 2013 budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| the school will receive money from and for Knox County General Purpose Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| school construction projects, great school partnership, early literacy, federal grants, state grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| and others, totaling $467 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| Knox County is given an additional $16 million, what we did not give last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| Normally we give $3 to $5 million some years, even $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| Now the school is still needing additional $31 million on top of the $16 that they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| And Commissioner Hammond and Chairman Dinkin, I appreciate what you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| It was at $35 million, and you all brought it down to some $31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| And now, Commissioner Hammond, you're saying now maybe just an additional $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| Well, this additional $31 million, I'm forgetting about what Mr. Hammond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| well, this additional $31 brings a total of $498 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| So here's what we know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| School board receives some $467 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| $16 million more than Knox County gave you in the last year, plus your unknown BEP money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| Your additional $31 million you're asking for is 6 percent of your total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| Commissioner Ed Schaus a few weeks ago said, politics is the art of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8638)|
| 2:24:03| A lot went off in my gray head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| I said, yep, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| Commissioner, every mayoral administration has asked all department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| office holders to cut their budgets every year some 10 to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| Our Sheriff's Department, Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Libraries, Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| Air Quality, Codes, IT, office holders, and the courts, to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| School gets the largest part of the county's budget, and you never have to reduce the amount you receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| So my concept plan idea, as Dr. McIntyre and the school board is, and to the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| here's what the leadership that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| The additional $31 million or, in case of Mr. Hammond just said, the additional $4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8683)|
| 2:24:49| that comes, the $31 million is 6 percent of the total budget that you'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| If you go with the 4 percent or 4 million, what Commissioner Hammond just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| that's 1 percent of the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| I'm proposing to go back, look at your budget, cut 6 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| or if you go with this, you're only going to cut 1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| There's no permanent tax increase for anybody, and the school gets what's important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8710)|
| 2:25:17| They go back and refocus on all the items that they want or some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8717)|
| 2:25:24| Go back and see why 46 percent of our students can't read at grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| and why the SAT scores have dropped in the biggest in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| and see what really is important to the success of our children's education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| and the programs that are showing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| Because we appropriate, once we appropriate this $16 million plus the $35 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| or the $4 million that we have, as you know, by state law, after two or three years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8744)|
| 2:25:50| if the project's not working, we cannot take the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8750)|
| 2:25:56| Dr. McIntyre, I like a lot, and I told you this yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| I like a lot of the items that you have on what you're doing for the student, your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| I like a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| I just think there's a way that if we go back, we can find 6 percent fat in a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| close to $500 million, and get what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| Any corporate corporation with a $500 million budget can cut 6 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| or rearrange priorities that really need to be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| I just find it hard to believe that with close to $500 million, there's not 6 percent fat to be trimmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| or, in Mr. Hammond's suggestion, less than 1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| So we don't have to have a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| Dr. McIntyre, corporate America is cutting some 15, 20, and 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| Then, when you do this, Dr. McIntyre and school board and commission members, it's a win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8800)|
| 2:26:47| We arrange your top educational enhancement and taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| and business owners don't have to encounter a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| Remember, we still haven't gotten our BEP totals, and that's a pleasant surprise at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8814)|
| 2:27:00| Remember last year, we were going to lay off 66 teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| and then we were going to lay off 33 teachers, and then it was down to 11 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| We laid off no teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| So, you know, and that's something, Mr. Chairman, that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| Maybe we need to do our budget after they have the BEP so we know what's in fairness to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| they know what figures they've really got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| And one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| The voters polled in the seventh edition across Knox County overwhelmingly against the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| have shown up by TV ads and newspapers polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| We got this in the mailbox over the weekend, very professionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| I got 28 phone calls on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| Twenty-seven were against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| Only one person was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| That's what the seventh district showed just on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| Very professionally done piece of literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| As commissioners, we have fiduciary responsibility of our limited tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| One billion in debt, we want to make it $1,034,000,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8870)|
| 2:27:56| Again, for any commissioner sitting on the fence, it's 6% or 1%, depending on what we do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| of the budget we're not funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| They can go back and find 6% to 1% in a $500 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| If they can't, they need to get a sharper knife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| Does anyone else have a proposal they want to bring forward with regards to schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| Before I start, and since the rules are suspended, I would just like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| because it went out there in the record, I do want to refute one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| The first gentleman from the Tea Party made a statement that was grossly inaccurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| and I followed up with Commissioner Briggs, and he doesn't understand where he was going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| But if you take the students that are absent at Austin, it doesn't equate to 35 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| So I just want to make sure that is a false statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| So with that said, you know, we've done a lot, and we've studied a lot, all 11 of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8936)|
| 2:29:06| and we've talked a lot out there to a lot of people over this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| This has been a really crystallizing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| Folks feel one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| I mean, there's not many people in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| So what I always try to do is look at the data, you know, follow the data on where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8963)|
| 2:29:36| where they're coming from with this proposal, and see if it comes to a logical end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| I'd venture to say I've not heard one person, I've answered a lot of calls, read a lot of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8981)|
| 2:29:48| and I've not heard one person describe how this budget is not accountable to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8988)|
| 2:29:56| I've not heard one instance by someone saying, this is why it's not transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| I've heard them say it's not transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| I've heard them say that, you know, you can't throw money, only throw money at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| I've not heard one person dig in and give me evidence of how we're not holding the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9010)|
| 2:30:19| the superintendent, the classroom teacher, the coach, or whatever aspect of this accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| You're holding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9025)|
| 2:30:26| You're holding them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| I love strategic compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| I know KCA doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| It works in corporate America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| It makes you work harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| If there's a carrot there, you will strive for that carrot, and that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9036)|
| 2:30:44| We're not talking about flat, cross the board, you're good, you're good, you're bad, you're bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| And that process in time will rise, raise the standard for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| People will strive to get whatever that dollar amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| The folks that didn't get it this year will work to get it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| The data shows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Longer days work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| Look at the school system where they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| They work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Show me one, a school system that has increased the number of educational hours and test scores have gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| That's a data point I want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| So, you know, this $31 million addition has been vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9082)|
| 2:31:31| We have talked about it a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| And in all due respect to the chairman's substitute motion, you know, I struggle with this at the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9094)|
| 2:31:48| We've had a long time to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| So two things I'll say and then I'll pass the mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9110)|
| 2:31:56| I hear talk about technology's bad, you know, personal electronic devices are bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9116)|
| 2:32:04| What if they don't have wireless at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| Those aren't valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| You download a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| The book is on the device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| You take the device home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| You read the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| You bring it back to have it upgraded to have the next book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| You don't need wireless at every home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| You know, they're going to steal their pieces and, you know, 20,000 iPads are going to be lost and stolen every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9142)|
| 2:32:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| My district has a lot of housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| And I spend time going through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| You see these rental, Aaron rents trucks, whatever rental trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| They understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| There's ways out there to recoup funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| Business people will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| There's ways out there to hold parents who may not have a lot, you know, in terms of resources accountable for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9168)|
| 2:32:55| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| I mean, that's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| That's not reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Is it reasonable to go back to the slide room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9178)|
| 2:33:05| Honestly, I was on the cusp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| I fortunately, you know, being a science major, fortunately did not have to learn how to use a slide room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9188)|
| 2:33:15| We never went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| I was also on the cusp in terms of having to compose at the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| That was a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| You had to write your papers out and then type them on the typewriter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| You know, when I was in undergrad and grad, that was when the first PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| That transformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| Now students can compose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| That's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| That's what they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| We're not going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| We're not going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| The world's not going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| We're not going back to that pen and pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| I think, you know, whatever happens, we're going to have to realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9226)|
| 2:33:56| We're going to have to realize that, you know, we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| The world is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| Technology is here to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| And the last thing I want to talk about is standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| In 1982, the average ACT score to get into the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| the average of the incoming freshmen was roughly 22 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| This year, I mean 22, a score of 22, roughly 22 on the ACT got you into the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9260)|
| 2:34:28| Graduation rates in 1980s, the lady, I forgot your name, did a beautiful job of talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9268)|
| 2:34:34| The one talked about the public-private and white flight and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| That was a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| Graduation rates were at 70s, 80 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| This year, 22, I mean 26.5, 26.8, I think, was the average score to get in the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9284)|
| 2:34:53| Things are evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| Graduation rates in Knox County are roughly 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| You know, rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| I don't know that exact number on the way up to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| Things are evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| We're going to have to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| I say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9310)|
| 2:35:11| We have jobs posted on our board at the lab for craft positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| These positions are requiring more and more associate degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| You know, you could get a job and go down to Standard Knit and Mill, Levi Strauss, Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| with or without a high school education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| Those jobs don't exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| They're not going to exist tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| They're not going to exist ten years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| The computer is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| And the gentleman from PILOT, to me, I mean just him sitting here, crystallizes this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| You know, Big Jim Haslam, when he started out, PILOT, oh, it's a gas station, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| In the 70s and 80s, who worked at a gas station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| What technology went involved that went into working at a gas station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| The ledgers, that's probably it, just keeping up with the balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| But the actual delivery of product and services, it took seventh, eighth grade education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| You know, you had to be able to add and subtract and do things basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| Now, look at PILOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| Look at what it takes to run one PILOT travel center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| Look at the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| I came back from Murfreesboro last night and stopped at a PILOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| The technology is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| You know, yeah, they may not know how to add $1.99 and $2.85 and $3.89 to get the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9389)|
| 2:36:36| but look at what they're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| They're able to do a whole lot more than they could, and I don't know what year PILOT was founded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| than that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| So things are moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9405)|
| 2:36:46| So what I'm interested in is this 31 cent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9406)|
| 2:36:52| So what my proposal, if it ever gets there, would be to let's go with what got us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9412)|
| 2:36:57| Let's go with what we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| And that is taking our major step forward for our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9418)|
| 2:37:06| But I do have one question for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9426)|
| 2:37:14| I do have one question for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| On your substitute motion, that $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| are you talking about incorporating that into the maintenance of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| or are they going to have to come back every year for that $3 million piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9443)|
| 2:37:28| Well, we would take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| Let me answer that in a couple of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| First of all, we'd be getting $1.5 million from the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| $1.5 million from the schools fund, and a million from a BEP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| But we would work with the finance director that if we get more BEP funds than we normally would get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9459)|
| 2:37:47| then we wouldn't need to take that much out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| And also we know that we're $21 million ahead in our tax collections, according to the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9470)|
| 2:37:56| And we don't even have May and June in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| So it may be that we would not need to take any out of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| depending on what the revenue situation looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| My proposal would be that this would be a one-year budget, and that we would take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| and we would hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| We would look at results, and we would revisit the budget next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| So we would have to, in your proposal, we would have to review that $3 million that everyone agrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9493)|
| 2:38:20| that early literacy program, we would have to that could not be funded, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9500)|
| 2:38:27| No, the mayor has put it in his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| Well, I thought it was in his proposal, it's not part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| It's under a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| It's not in the maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| It's not in the maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| So is your proposal putting that into the maintenance of effort piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| My proposal would be that it not be put in maintenance of effort piece, that we have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| and that we have it for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| But I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| We could put it in the maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| Yes, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| I just want to clarify this for Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| I'm sorry for not hitting my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| But I think what just to be sure we're understanding is that Sam is saying this is a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| and not part of the budget, because if it's in the budget, I believe it would have to be maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9544)|
| 2:39:10| If it's a grant, it would not necessarily be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| And this would be a recurring part of the budget, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| But if it's a grant, like what the mayor did, then we would review that every year and decide whether to review the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| Let me go ahead and say that I would ask that it be part of maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| And the reason I say that is because of this community schools program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| I'm sold on this community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| And I think that if we just do it a year, I would put it as maintenance of efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| But we hold them accountable on the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| I've already seen the results of this and some of the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| So, Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| A couple of things I want to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| One is I have been a full supporter of this $35 million to the schools from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9587)|
| 2:40:00| because I'm a firm believer in what we accomplished at our joint retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| and I see this as the way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| And I am so deeply grateful to Commissioner Hammond and to Chairman Deakins for all the work that they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9610)|
| 2:40:20| I should say, I'm sorry, Chairman Hammond and Chairman Deakins on all the work they've done to hammer out compromises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| and make this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| And I was on board with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| And, you know, I've gotten the same e-mails, phone calls, postcards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9631)|
| 2:40:39| conversations at the grocery store and the pickup line at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9639)|
| 2:40:44| And I'm getting tremendous support for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9644)|
| 2:40:51| I'm also getting a tremendous amount of people who are not supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9651)|
| 2:41:00| And what I've discovered is that when I talk to these people, and unfortunately, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9660)|
| 2:41:09| unfortunately a lot of people have been frightened by misinformation that they have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9669)|
| 2:41:17| And they've called me saying, please don't raise my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| I'm going to lose my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| And when I've been able to call them back and actually talk to them one on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| and correct the misinformation about what actually is being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| and the issues and explain to them what the school system is planning to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9695)|
| 2:41:43| eight out of ten of the people that I talk to either no longer oppose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9703)|
| 2:41:51| and some of them are even for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| And about, I guess, half a dozen of the hundreds I've talked to have even invited my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9714)|
| 2:42:02| and I over for dinner, which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| These are wonderful couples mostly that I speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| But so that tells me that when we do a good job of communicating to our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9728)|
| 2:42:17| when we are respectful to our citizens and to our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| and give them the facts and take the time to discuss with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9743)|
| 2:42:28| and engage in a dialogue and listen to them, then we can bring them along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9748)|
| 2:42:37| And we can also have a better understanding of where their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| I have a lot of senior citizens in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| and I don't just mean the ones that live at God Be Loved Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| and Broadway Towers and Northgate Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| I have a lot of little old ladies who still live in these old houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9771)|
| 2:42:57| and these old neighborhoods where they've lived their entire lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| And what I also learned is that a great many of them, when we were talking about taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| and their property taxes and their fixed income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| and I've mentioned the senior property tax freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| what I've discovered is that a lot of them don't realize that that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| So one thing that I'm going to do this next year is challenge our trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| and his staff to do an outreach program to our senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| to let them know that this senior tax freeze is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| One other thing I've noticed in learning more about it myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| and talking to senior citizens is that it doesn't cover enough seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| It only covers those at this point whose income is below $36,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9819)|
| 2:43:47| which is just doesn't go far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| So I'm also committed to working this next year with the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| and hopefully also with Governor Haslam to work at expanding that senior property tax freeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9835)|
| 2:44:02| to cover more of our senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| because I am very concerned about placing an undue burden on our seniors who are dependent on only SSI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9846)|
| 2:44:14| for their income and being able to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| So for these reasons, and also I feel like if we have one more year to work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9858)|
| 2:44:29| we can also bring around a very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| I really appreciate Mr. Deakins and Mr. Hammond putting out the idea of a teacher survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9872)|
| 2:44:40| a comprehensive teacher survey, because this will give us an opportunity to reach out to those most important people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9880)|
| 2:44:47| in our school system and truly get their input so that we can get their complete buy-in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9887)|
| 2:44:56| So I feel like giving them the $7 million that they need now to get started on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| where it's most important, which is in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| and holding off until next year to work on these capital and facilities improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9906)|
| 2:45:15| gives us that breathing space to work with the teachers to get the community buy-in that we need to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9915)|
| 2:45:24| And I'm convinced that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| The experience I've had, the most wonderful time the last three weeks talking to all the people who have called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9926)|
| 2:45:33| And like I said, as I've learned that if you take the time to really talk with them and you respect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9933)|
| 2:45:39| and you give them the facts and listen to them, eight out of ten of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| now some of them you're never going to be able to change their mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| but eight out of ten of them are receptive and they may not be, you know, a full supporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9946)|
| 2:45:53| but at least they no longer oppose it because they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| And I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9958)|
| 2:45:59| And it will also give me time to work for the senior citizens that I represent on expanding this tax freeze to give them a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9959)|
| 2:46:06| little more protection so that they won't feel quite so vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| So that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| And also, sending this capital when you're out, you know, the communities that are going to be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9971)|
| 2:46:20| that were going to be affected by this facilities improvement, Adrian Burnett, Pond Gap, Shannondale, Farragut, Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9980)|
| 2:46:27| Austin East, New Hopewell, Gibbs, Northwest, Bearden, Inskip, Moreland Heights, Maynard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| all of these communities need to understand what's at stake with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| And they need to, you know, if we were able to get this many people here this year for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| we can get twice as many here next year to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| I'm convinced of it when we get all these communities buying in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| So that's why I do support getting that $7 million into the classroom as soon as possible where it's most needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10014)|
| 2:47:02| and then working to get the senior protections in place, the teacher and community buy-ins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10022)|
| 2:47:09| and doing the rest of this heavy lifting starting next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10029)|
| 2:47:16| I would also like to point out that one of the things that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10036)|
| 2:47:22| or that we heard during public forum about the career and technical education, which I agree is absolutely crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| Not everyone is going to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| And I'm very happy that in this past year I've really seen Dr. McIntyre take CTE on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| as something that he is really promoting and putting a lot of support behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| But I'd also like to point out that one of the reasons that, and Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10067)|
| 2:47:53| he talks about his visit to, I believe it was Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| and he had the welding student come up and say, you know, I need my welding class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| The reason those classes were cut was because we have underfunded our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| We have short-changed our students by chronically underfunding our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| And it's time to step up and fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| And this is an opportunity for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| I would also ask that since I'm not going to, we're not going to be the property tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10095)|
| 2:48:24| not ask for one cent for seniors, and I still truly believe in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| and believe me, I will be coming back at some point to do more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| But in light of all of this, what I'd like to do is ask that we appropriate, out of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10113)|
| 2:48:43| a $300,000 additional funding for CAC Transit to help this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10123)|
| 2:48:52| One of the things that we're having a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| and I don't know if I did post the information on the forum for you all to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10135)|
| 2:49:01| One of the problems that, and I'm sorry that there seems to be some misunderstanding about what CAC Transit does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10141)|
| 2:49:12| Knoxville Area Transit runs their routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| If there is a senior citizen or a person with a disability who needs to go somewhere in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10156)|
| 2:49:24| and they either, where they're leaving from, their home, or their destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10164)|
| 2:49:31| or the time of their trip is not on the CAT routes or the CAT schedule, they call CAC Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10171)|
| 2:49:41| And CAC Transit is responsible for providing transportation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10181)|
| 2:49:48| So CAC Transit actually provides transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| CAT provides transportation to the people along their route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| CAC Transit provides transportation to everyone else, every other senior citizen and person with a disability in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120604?start=10197)|
