| 0:00:00| Find our seats if we could. It's a little bit past 5.30. We want to start promptly and end promptly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| So we'll go ahead and call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=9)|

| 0:01:18| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| I know Councilman Grieve will be here. He had some business to attend to, but he will be here a little bit late, but will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=81)|
| 0:01:30| I want to remind everybody again how great it is to be on City Council and not County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=90)|
| 0:01:39| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| But we are in a special room here and I would just remind everyone to turn on their microphone when it's time to speak and please let's be courteous of each other and not talk over and try to speak in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=102)|
| 0:01:56| With that being said, I will let the administration open and see if you have some opening remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis. I want to make a few opening remarks and Mayor O'Hara will add as she sees fit after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| We appreciate the opportunity to say a couple things at the beginning of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| I think we'd like to start it with the overriding principle that the administration feels strongly about and has felt strongly about from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| that we're looking forward to a ballot, items on the ballot, hopefully one item on the ballot in November when we're going to have a presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| Probably county questions that will be on the ballot, a voting machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| I think we're all familiar with how that works, the challenges of items coming up and turning the wheel and getting there that sort of present a case for maximum potential voter confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=158)|
| 0:02:48| We strongly believe that the best way to approach this is to have one question changing the pension plan on this year's ballot so that we can then have the message clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=168)|
| 0:03:00| vote to fix the pension and that that be the only message that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| There are other items here that many have a lot of merit, there's no doubt about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| but our feeling is that these structural items would be best delayed for two years and getting this one item clearly before the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| because I think it's very naive to think that there won't be a high potential for voter confusion on which particular pension item is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| am I for this one, maybe I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| And the propensity when people get confused on a long ballot is to just leave and not vote at all or to vote in a hurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| or to default to voting no out of confusion because there's sufficient noise out there and all those things are realistic considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| that I think would be a mistake not to take into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| That leads us to say our preference is that we have the one item, the large item changing the nature of the pension be the only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| One other thing that I could add to that is there are ways in terms of the enlarging of the board question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| there are ways to get at the same ends that are out there, council could by ordinance set up an advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| we could see how that could function to advise the rest of the pension board on investment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| I know that's the main consideration and then again this question could be addressed later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| it certainly is one that has merit, I don't think there's any doubt that that's worth looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| The other one is by nature much more, going to be much more conflictual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| and I think the danger in it beyond even getting it to the merits of whether the pension is in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| or by ordinance is going to raise a lot of very major questions that will lead to folks being very opposed to it in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| and again leading to the possibility that the voter won't be sure which one of these are both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| they quote unquote if they want to fix the pension they should vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| So our position I guess in summary is we would respectfully request that any of these structural changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=292)|
| 0:05:00| the cleanup changes, housekeeping changes, governance changes be kept for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| and brought up later apart from the major question that's before us that we'll be addressing on Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| I just want to add that we want pension reform to happen this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| and we have many of you all and those of us in the administration have worked with the employee groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| and we've come to something that perhaps reluctantly was something I think we can get our employee groups behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| our employees, council and the public if we're all united and then we can get something passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| If we start bringing in other items that may not have support among the different parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| it starts to add confusion and then I'm afraid it's going to be more difficult to get the reform passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| Again with the confusion, it'll be confusion among the city ones in addition to adding all the county ones that might be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| So that's why we are requesting that council put one item on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| and that be the one that we've been working on for some time now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you very much. We will of course have public forum at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| but are there questions from council of the administration at this point before we move into the regular agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=373)|
| 0:06:24| I was going to say, do I understand correctly that they would like to have one item on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| I think that's what they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| One clarification, the items we voted on last time regarding the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| those are going to be done by ordinance because they're literally legal tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| Yes, those are the IRS, the changes based on the IRS code. Yes, that is done by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=407)|
| 0:06:56| So that does not go on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| That does not go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Because that would be terribly confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| Yes, I just want to comment on something Dr. Lyons said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| As a former election worker, and I worked here a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| a lot of people when they have these types of questions on ballots, they will not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| Many times. I've seen it happen many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| So I just want to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I've been able to not look over people's shoulders as they vote, that's for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| but listening to comments as people leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| especially when you have these kinds of things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Further questions or comments to the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| If not, we'll go ahead and move into the agenda here that we posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=467)|
| 0:07:56| I want to remind everybody that we need to stick with these subjects this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| This is the subjects that we published for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| so we'll need to, of course, limit our conversation to these three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| With that, I'll open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Okay, we'll go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Well, I think the first one is removing city council from benefit and from the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| and I think this is, as a group and, you know, as city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| you have to set yourself apart from these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| You have to look at them objectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| You have to look at them from 10,000 feet, as I like to say, in order not to be biased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| We're given the charge to look at the dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| and you're given the charge to look at what's the best use of taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| and I think when you take a benefit from it and when we're benefiting from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| I think it's just not right, and I think you remove yourself from it and take yourself out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| Last meeting, by consent, we voted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| to award a pension plan from a long-time city council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| and I'll just show you right there, I think it was a little over $500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Not that he didn't earn it, not that he didn't serve, but right there it should tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| And I think one of the things that, one of the corrections that we've made is that it's a 10-year vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| So in most of our cases with two-term limits, we're pretty much taking ourselves out of it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| except for people that have either been an employee of the city, come back and run as city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| or, you know, run at large or, you know, add on as being in a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| So it's really, it's a minor tweak, but I think it sends a message to the public and to the voter that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| look, we're taking ourselves out of it and we're being very objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| and we have their best interest at heart, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| You know, I agree with George that this is kind of a no-brainer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| and I think many of us have expressed the desire to remove ourselves, which apparently we're not able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| Nevertheless, I understand what the administration is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| This is also an item that we could do in two years and avoid any potential confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| We don't have to do this right now, but this is an item that, in my mind, we should move on as soon as it is practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=628)|
| 0:10:37| Maybe it is now, maybe it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| That's for us to decide, but this one is, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| something we need to do either now or in two years, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Councilman Wallace, I appreciate your bringing this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| and I am one of those who tried to withdraw from the plan and found out I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| because I'm not comfortable being in the position we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| At the same time, I respect the administration not wanting to create voter confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| If you've watched any of the meeting next door today or some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| you know that confusion can reign pretty easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| and I agree with Councilman Saunders that this is something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| if this is not resolved with the passage of the hybrid plan by the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| so that there is a 10-year vesting period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| then this is something that we would need to bring forward in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| When there's less on the ballot, there won't be any county items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| It would be a gubernatorial election and these kinds of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| And we did this, I finally got this clarified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| that we did have an item on the last ballot when the gubernatorial race occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| and it passed very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Voters didn't seem to be confused about that or much of anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| So I endorse and I applaud this idea very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| I would agree that we need to deal with this in two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| if this is not resolved by the voters with the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Well, I think this particular piece could be added into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| that you've already submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| And I think this is a tweak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| I don't think it has to go to the voters as much as you can put it in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| So I don't know, or I'll throw that out as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| Generally speaking, I'd like to defer to Attorney Gilbert on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| A couple of points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| You all had an earlier straw poll indicating that people who were current city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| but not yet vested because you didn't want to change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| in the middle of the game for them, you all weren't going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| I mean, there are nine of you all that theoretically did apply to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| The pension that you referenced earlier, Councilman Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| was for someone who served 16, 18 years on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| I mean, just from my personal experience, because I invested from eight years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| I think in 20-something years when I'm eligible, it'll only be like $110 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| It won't be the $500-something a month figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| I'll just ask Mr. Gilbert, can this be crafted where the current members of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| would be removing themselves in the current, if it was put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| with the proposed pension changes, or is it best left out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=822)|
| 0:13:53| Bud Gilbert, 550 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| We represent the city in the preparation of the proposed Plan H plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| I guess the best way to answer it, and it goes back to what the mayor is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| it can be done, it just complicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| You've got to have a broader caption, you've got to make sure that your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| that is the question that is repeated on the actual ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| not only covers, right now it's a rather simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| Can we explain the question? I don't think that was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| The question is whether it can be incorporated into the charter question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| And the answer is, you can put multiple subjects in the ordinance that brings the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| but at the end of the day, you've got to have a question in that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| that goes on the people's ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| And now, instead of just having a simple question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| shall the existing plans be closed, and a new plan adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| I've got to add words in the question that covers the ambit of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| which would then have to say, and shall existing members of the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| be excluded from the new, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Well, you've got levers in the plan now, I mean, why wouldn't it just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| I mean, you can't, you're not talking about people who are already vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I mean, you're talking about as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I would think it would just be a part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Oh, okay, I understand where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Part of the hybrid plan that we've submitted is just buried into the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Right, that is another way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| That's how, that's my, not as a, I mean, not this particular one, I'm not suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| I've just come from an eight-hour drafting session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| and my brain is so fried right now talking about the pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| but yes, that is another way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| That's my suggestion, just bury it into the plan that we've already submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| and make that a tweak back to the pension board, just one particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| And if council so wills it, we'll see that it comes back to you in the first draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| It's not about the money, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| It's really about the perception that we're sitting here as government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| and we're also padding our own pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| It's not about the, I mean, I didn't want the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| I didn't want to participate in it, but I had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And as a CEO of a company, I have to be objective about pay raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| and pension plans and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| These are tough issues, and you have to make those tough issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| and you have to be objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| And all I'm saying with this one little thing is that we're making ourselves totally objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| It's not necessarily about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| I don't regret that he paid that, that he earns that, and that you didn't either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| that you do either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| The point is we're here as a government body, and we should remain totally objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| It shouldn't be, oh, let's vote on this or else pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| I mean, it shouldn't be about that, and that's why I suggest you take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| I didn't think this particular ought to be an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| as much as just bury it into the eligibility like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| Well, I mean, I agree, but that $500-something amount opened my eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| but then I realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Yeah, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| You take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| You know, I mean, just do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I mean, it's what we're in every one of those is do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I mean, it's a lot of money, and I think that's not what we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and this body's not going to have 18 years in it unless they're an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and then they come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| But, you know, I'm all about making it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Let's make it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Okay, well, it's not going to be simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| This ballot is not going to be simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| but we're here for pension reform and push it down the road two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| I mean, let's make a statement that says we're willing to change some of these basic things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| and talk about what some of the basic things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| And one, and two and three can go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| I mean, obviously, maybe there's not enough support here for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| and that being the case, maybe there will be in two years, and who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| But I think the reason behind it is it's just what we're up against right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| You look back, and last year you had a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Mayor Brown came in, and he also had four council members that were going to be retiring out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| All four of us were brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| I can understand why he didn't want to bring it up last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| and begin working on this pension plan because it took a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| He had four people going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| It would have had to have been done long before it would have gone to the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and then all these new guys, we wouldn't have had an opportunity to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| And so it would have been very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| It just wasn't the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| But we're bounced up against this two-year time slot every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and that's the reason for taking it out of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Yes, it's simple. Okay, simple. It's not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| This is really what's best for the long term for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| and what's best for the long-term governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| We were given the governance of how to manage this pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| and you're backed up with two years, every two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| of having to decide on certain issues that you're really restricted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| And one of those is certainly if we had the opportunity, if it was out of the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| we could take city council, we could vote ourselves out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| That would have been a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| You could also change the makeup of your pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| One of your problems we've talked about over whatever, seven workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| is that there's nobody there or not enough people there that really know about pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| and how to invest and that are totally objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| And I think that that's my point on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| is that there ought to be people around there with a vote that are totally objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| that are not also receiving a pension plan or potentially a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| And the governance under the charter, always against referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| always up against the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| To me, that's what we've been elected to do is to govern that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| and govern as a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| And being buried into the charter gives us a lot of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| And I think that it's a bold move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| It's not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Sure, just think about it from an employer-employee standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| which we are in essence the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| If I had to go to my employees and ask them if they wanted to raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| their answer is always going to be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| If I go to my employees and say, hey, I'm going to have to cut your pay or cut your pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| the answer is always going to be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| There's always going to be that resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| It should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| And that's what we're challenged with is to govern that and to balance that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| And we've got to bring it fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| But, yeah, there's always going to be resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| The fact that the employees are probably against that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| it might make it worthwhile to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| because there are certain things that are employee-employer relationships are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| they're always going to be at odds over certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| It still has to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| It still has to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| But it also has to be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And I think you've got some, as a council, you have a lot more authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| and a lot more push on the pension plan if it's outside the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| instead of backed up against a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| And it's something that I think it's worth talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| But a city council issue, I think, is something pretty easily to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| I mean, take a straw poll vote and if you vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| then send it back to the pension board to bury it into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I just had a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I mean, I'm certainly for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| I think it's ridiculous that we're the only part-time employees that receive a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| So I'm certainly in for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| But from what I understand, I mean, we're all on the old plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| So are we talking about future council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Are we talking about taking us off the old plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| I don't know how you take us off the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I mean, that would be great, but I don't know how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| We're talking about basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I think that would take a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| I mean, there's another example of being buried under that pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| I think it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| So, no, I'm not in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Either take care of it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| And we've taken care of a lot of that with a 10-year vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| But not everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| But, I mean, it's a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| But it makes a statement that we're about pension reform, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| I would be in favor of either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| I guess I'll say, I mean, I've lived it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| because I remember Councilwoman Malone and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| when I was on the first time for the first six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| we refused to be part of the pension plan because just what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| I think it's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| There's no, that I know of, any part-time work out there where you get a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And I just didn't think it was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| And I fought and did what I could to try to prevent that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| And, obviously, I wasn't very successful at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| But I would certainly come back out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| I don't know if we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| You know, if we put it on the ballot in two years, you know, we can make it retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| I don't know if you can do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| But I would certainly be in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| I don't know how you can sit there and vote on, I don't want to say padding your pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| but I don't want to say padding your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| I mean, that's just the perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Actually, if Bud agrees that we could incorporate it with the existing changes we've suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| I'd be comfortable with that because I really don't want to cause any more confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| The other two items I think would be more difficult to deal with in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| There was a little bit of confusion in hearing what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| You basically have three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And I think you said it best, Councilman, or at least you clarified what you meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| You certainly can eliminate the legislative body as a group of employees going forward in Plan H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| You can also eliminate in the current plans any of the council members who don't have five years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| because they're not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| That's not a Blackwell problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| The third option is you could eliminate all legislative members even in the back plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| even if they're vested, if they consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| But the latter two options are more complex because you do have to have more language in the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| and make sure that it's covered, whereas the first one is the simplest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| That's relatively easy to do, as you surmised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| I just wasn't clear on which way you were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I think it's burying it into the plan, incorporating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| The law director points out that the latter two options probably are two questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| because it becomes difficult when you have multiple answers in the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| If you're going to have multiple questions, that's not the question I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| If we could ever get to that, I wouldn't be the one I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I like the idea that removing council from the pension plan could be one of the levers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| that we have just added to the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| I would be very comfortable with that, and then it would just be embedded into the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| The other two, the structure of the pension board and the removal of the pension plan from city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| This looks pretty simple on the surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| but I'm not hearing such positive comments from people who ultimately will be helping fund part of the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1533)|
| 0:25:44| the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| People like to have a voice in how their money is going to be spent in cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| I think that removing the charter from the pension plan makes changes, additions, subtractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1553)|
| 0:26:03| whatever, to the pension plan an object of possible political agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1563)|
| 0:26:14| I can think of some situations, not necessarily in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| but in some other places where tradeoffs were made to get some enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| that probably turned out in the long run to have not been good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| But at the time they seemed wise, and they did move forward agendas of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| So it concerns me that while on the surface taking the pension plan from the charter looks like a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| because then we could act more quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| I also see it as an opportunity for politics to become very much embedded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| And one of the beauties of city council is that we are a nonpartisan group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| and I know that everybody who comes here has some political leanings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| I'm not that naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| But I also think that we are very open-minded at looking things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| I read in the paper this morning that there is a public sentiment for the county commission to become a nonpartisan body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| I probably won't live that long to see that happen, and neither will most of us at this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| However, that being said, I really have a real concern about politics becoming involved in that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1637)|
| 0:27:27| And then the second one on restructuring the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| I would want to look at or know more about what do we have in mind for restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| Are we looking, and Finbar probably and the mayor can address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| because they're both, even though newcomers to the pension board, at least they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| It concerns me that the people who do serve on the board need to really be very aware of things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| I think that Councilman Saunders has indicated that the board is going to be looking at several things involving risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| and other issues that perhaps have not been as much in the forefront as they have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| So I could see having some people with technical expertise have a stronger role or a more advisory role to the board itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1693)|
| 0:28:23| I'm not sure about expanding the size of the board and bringing in other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| because then it becomes the issue of how do you pick these people and how do you be sure they don't have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| We don't have a big pool in Knoxville of people who might do this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you, Councilwoman Power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| These two questions I really want us to talk about, but I think what the mayor and Bill just suggested in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| some sort of advisory board to begin to test these waters might be helpful in regards to the restructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| or some structuring of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Everybody on the pension board, as far as I'm concerned, is trying hard and trying to do their very best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| There's one person on that board, and that's Jim York, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| who probably understands the markets and the whole machinations of all these workings better than anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| certainly better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| But by and large, we don't have financial backgrounds, and we need some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| We need some input, some arm's length input in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| I am often not comfortable with some of the advice, and often because I just don't understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1771)|
| 0:29:40| and I don't like to deal with things that I can't understand, and some of them are not so simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Now, perhaps everybody else on the board understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| It's just me. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| But I suspect if I'm confused, maybe others may be as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| So at some point, I really want to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| And actually, the mayor and I have talked about this, albeit briefly, several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| And I don't know how the mayor feels, but I still feel new on that board, and it's something I want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| I hope that this council will help in that pursuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| I would like to do that over the next year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| I think a lot of things are going to become much clearer as we go forward with addressing the pension situation we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1819)|
| 0:30:29| And I think our clarity is an important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and I think that will become more clear in the community and certainly more clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you, Councilman Saunders. Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Just something that I thought about when Councilman Saunders was speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| is that if some of our local people who are investment specialists are on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| then we're very restricted in being able to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| But if they're an advisory committee, then if they're advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| because right now, technically anything we're going to vote on, Finbar and I can't speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| I can't speak with Jim and others about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| So we're very limited because we're a deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| If there's sort of a team of experts locally who are willing to talk and help explain and this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| we would have fewer restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| It's just one thing to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| And then let's see how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| If we decide that over the next year or so that we really need somebody in a voting situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| then we could certainly put that on the ballot in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| But I, like Councilman Saunders, have found that people on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| it's to our, it's anybody who's a member of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| it's to your advantage to have sound investment advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| You know, it's because you want your plan to be strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| and you know that if there's a lot of unfunded liability or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| then there's going to create this kind of a situation where your plan is threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And so ultimately it's to your advantage to have good advice in terms of the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| But again, one ballot issue and let's bring in some advisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| and be able to talk to them without the restrictions of being a member of the deliberative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Yeah, I was listening to Councilman Wallace and trying to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and FINBAR as well, this board, it has two or three functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| But one of the functions is looking at disability cases and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| and they're kind of an internal fairness review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And it seems to me that that works well with a group that's got employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| and administration or management there talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| But the other function where you're making either investment decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| or you're really not making them so much as evaluating the recommendation that we go this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| but my guess is there's an awful lot of deference that goes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| That's where it seems like this sort of independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| not otherwise involved advice would come in handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| And whether that's in the form of a separate advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| an ad hoc visitation by some people who have that investment skill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| that seems like a healthy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Because the flip side of everyone wanting to see the pension plan succeed is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| the way it stands right now, if it doesn't succeed, the city taxpayers throw in the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| So it's got a backstop that's covered even if it doesn't succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| And I think it is healthy that we find some way to bring in that knowledge base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| It was not hard sitting here during all these workshops to realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| Mr. Pennington was trying real hard to educate us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| but frankly one of his interests is to keep that business for his firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| And he's always in that situation of being your hired counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| but trying to have a business relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And I'm sure that's true of everyone else that advises that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| so that the lawyer has to try to satisfy the client in terms of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| Obviously they have an ethical duty to do things correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| but there's that kind of closed circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| So the basic intent that Mr. Wallace has put forward is a healthy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Find some way to get ideas in from someone who isn't getting a paycheck for the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| or counting on the result themselves personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Because every one of the seven people that's on that board is a member of the pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| as well as a steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| I agree with the concept and the question is how do we get it done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| and maybe we can look at that a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I think it's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Counselor Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Well, I think that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| I mean, I'm not a financial guy and we've sat here and relied on Pennington to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| and educate us over seven workshops in a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| And I think you need people on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| There are people in our community that that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| They do pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| They do pensions for government bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I mean, they're in our community and I think, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| hopefully they're willing to serve in some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| There's people that understand financial investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Not at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| And understanding risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| And I think you need some people on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| And then they need a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| I mean, I'm all for advisories, but I've been advisory on other boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| and when you don't have a vote, they don't have to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| And I think that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| That's certainly a reasonable step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| But you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| We need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| We need people that can talk Alan Pennington's language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Because I can't and most of us can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| And just to make sure that, you know, just for accountability, if nothing else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| just to kind of get, you know, what else is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| It's not that these people on there are doing a bad job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| as much as it's very, very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| And it's way over, you know, the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| It's over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| And I've had to learn a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I don't deal with pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| So it's very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| That's the point of trying to break up the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| and, you know, we're trying to bring some people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| that will serve in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| I thought Councilman Wallace was going to do this, but I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| On the first, you will do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| On the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| You want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| I guess my proposal, my motion would be to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| on a straw poll vote, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| to bury it in the current plan that we're sending to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| to eliminate future city council people from participating in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2201)|
| 0:36:53| Defining out those people as not being eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| is different than burying, which has the connotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| of maybe being hidden under a picture basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| So moved, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Yeah, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| I mean, that's just an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| I would agree with Councilman Wallace that this is probably a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| for us to take a straw poll about embedding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| as one of the leavers in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| Further input on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Let me just ask one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| I understood the advice of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| As long as you're defining a term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| you probably don't have a separate caption and question kind of articulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| so that if we're simply defining that plan differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| it's still one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| That's what they told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| So that makes it very easy to do, I guess, in terms of not they can stay up at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| and write it, but easy for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| We can just say, yes, write it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| Yes, Councilman Stager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| I mean, I just sort of have a clarification on this, on straw polls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| because I'm actually pretty frustrated with straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I feel like I don't really understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| If we vote in favor of this, is that going to be final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| or is there going to be a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| No, it's not final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| It's not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| That's why I would say let's not do the straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| I mean, Councilmember Greene is not here and doesn't really do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I mean, I think we can just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I mean, you've got to send something to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| We've already sent a proposal to the pension board for them on the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| and this is adding another paragraph, if you will, to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| But, I mean, can we do that here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Hold on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Councilman Stager has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Well, I guess my question is if we're going to do a straw poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| the straw poll would actually do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Well, I mean, if I could, I mean, I think it shows intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Is it binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| But, you know, I for one think that it's moved us well through the previous process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| of knowing, I mean, why go through the motions of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| and, you know, everything it's going to take to get us to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| if the votes aren't there, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| If I could add a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Oh, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Councilman Stager has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I mean, I sort of see the – my thing is I said it's just a straw poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| and everybody said it doesn't mean anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| but it does mean something that's going to add a paragraph to the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| So it is – I mean, that's my frustration with straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| And my frustration with last time is before the straw poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| everybody said it's just a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| This is just to see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| And then after it, they said decision's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| So, you know, if you're on the losing side, you kind of think, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| I thought it was just a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| So, I mean, I think it works better as a resolution at a formal meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| and, you know, we have a proper vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Let me recognize Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I think maybe Councilman Stager appreciates what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| We're looking – the straw poll provides direction in providing the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| but until that resolution is voted on, it doesn't have any – it's not legally binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| So it's not that the straw poll doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| It's meaningful in providing instruction to prepare the resolution that would come back to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| as Vice Mayor Pevelis says, then knowing with that that that's something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| as this entire package comes forth, represents the will of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| has been expressed to the administration in drawing up the resolution that will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| You can't vote in a workshop is the reason formally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| but you can give guidance in a workshop to provide a document that you can vote on legally in a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| Okay, if I could, let me recognize Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| I'll come back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I just want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| These three items that we're considering tonight and discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| will all of these eventually have to be approved by the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| It cannot be handled by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Is that correct, the three things that we're discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| Or they all have to be approved by voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| I'll let Attorney Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| Certainly, the measure you've been discussing, eliminating council members in the future from being in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| would have to be in the new plan, so that would have to be approved by the charter amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Adding more members to the pension board would require a charter amendment approved by the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| because the pension board is constituted in Charter Section 1324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| And then the third proposition, taking the plan out of the charter would also require a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2515)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Mr. Gilbert, while you're there, I think Attorney Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| There was a discussion of an advisory board for the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| Now, if it was purely advisory, could that be done by ordinance and not have to go through the charter process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| Actually, that is an idea that has been broached before with some of the members of council who have served in the prior elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2538)|
| 0:42:27| And as you will recall, the investment policy is adopted by ordinance of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| It's established by City Council and then the pension board administers it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| and brings recommended amendments back to City Council for approval through an ordinance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| When we were last before City Council, it was the feeling of the pension board that we needed more effort and energy applied to investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| and we created the investment committee, which is a committee of three members of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| that also meet monthly and devote their attention on investment matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| We established that committee as part of the ordinance adopting the investment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| and indeed we put the investment committee charter to the back of the policy as an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| And the pension board had earlier discussed the concept that the mayor has expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| that an advisory council could be very helpful to the mission and the function of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| The exact constitution of it, of course, would have to be decided by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| But what we would do at the pension board is probably think that through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| bring some proposals for council's consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| and it would also be in the form of an advisory council that is described in some kind of document, a charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| that we would suggest be appended to the back of the investment policy and approved by ordinance by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| So council ultimately would have the decision on who would be on that advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| what would its duties and functions would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| And we wouldn't need an amendment to the charter that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you. Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I just want to add the reason why, again, why these straw polls are important is that we have a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| you all will remember, in order to get this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| And so next Tuesday is the last council meeting in which you can vote on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| on the resolution to then send to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| And we have a special meeting set for the 19th or 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| On the 19th to consider whatever you all vote on so that we can do our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| and then send it back to you to then have two more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| And so we need to know today, in order to prepare, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| they've put a lot of several attorneys, Bill and our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| and all have spent quite a bit of time trying to draft what you have already indicated by straw votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| what you want to see on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| And so it is very important that you decide tonight if there's anything else you want to include in the current one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| or if you decide, which we hope you won't, to add something new, you know, another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| Even then it will be tough to draft it by Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| But that has to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| You all have to vote on this on Tuesday to send something to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| if we're going to have something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| You know, with all due respect to Councilman Steyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| I do think there's enough of the council members, unless I'm reading wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| that we would probably want to proceed with the straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And with that being said, Councilman Wallace, would you mind restating your motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2734)|
| 0:45:42| He meant in bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2742)|
| 0:45:52| In bed sounds worse than buried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| Exclude by definition that city council members would be excluded by definition from the pension plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2760)|
| 0:46:10| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Councilman Brown? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Councilman Campin? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Councilman Della Vopi? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Councilman Palmer? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Vice Mayor Pavlis? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Councilman Saunders? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Councilman Steyer? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Councilman Wallace? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| I just wonder, since this is non-binding, when a council person is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| like Councilman Green, can he still cast a straw poll vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2812)|
| 0:47:01| Just out of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| Well, I mean, I think there would probably be, I mean, there's, oh boy, this is going to get a quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| we're in imaginary land, let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| And I think it would probably be the will, and I certainly don't want to speak for members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| but I'll speak for myself in that I think the vote that's taken by those present would be the binding, non-binding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2841)|
| 0:47:33| Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| If I may, and if I'm wrong, I mean, you know, other council members, please speak up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| but I think that's the intent of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Let's go back to the straw vote issue for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Councilman Steyer, like you, I was not real sure where this was all going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| but we also know that because of the Sunshine Laws, we can't ever communicate with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| and I think that this gives us a good example to know what the thinking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| and in some cases it causes us to change our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| and in some cases it causes us to dig in deeper, or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| But I personally have come to think that this is a workable, even though it's non-binding, it is workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| We know where the will of council seems to be, and on sometimes issues that's pretty important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2901)|
| 0:48:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| Well, that's how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| I mean, I'm trying to deal with this whole Sunshine thing, trying to understand it, how to work around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| I mean, I didn't really want to have a workshop, but I wanted to talk about these three points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| and I'm still learning the ropes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| Well, I still think that you can take the pension out of the charter and be really fine and organize it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2929)|
| 0:48:59| and I think you make a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| I mean, that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| You study it for two years, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Let's study it for two years and talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| but I don't know how else to talk about things and get things on the table without having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| So it is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| It is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I would not vote against putting just for the simplification of the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| I mean, the ballot is going to be long and complicated anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| and I think it's probably easier to explain why you're closing the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| Closing the current pension plan because it's broke, as Councilmember Stair likes to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| and I think this is another way of taking it out from underneath the confines of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| and amendments and referendums expensive, you know, just the confines of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| It just simplifies what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| But anyway, it's an idea, and the devil's in the details, as they say, and trying to work that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| but I think long term it would serve the city of Knoxville better to be out from underneath the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| And if I may, I want to commend you for the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| You've been diligent in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| You've been talking about this one issue since we were midway through the pension talks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| and I know it's very important to you, and you've done a great job of steering this through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| and you've gotten it to this point, and this is the only way we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| I mean, you know, if you could pick up the phone and say, hey, Nick, what do you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| then I mean, but that obviously is not the way that we should do business, nor do we do business that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| But just an update, it won't be too much longer that we'll have the internet forum up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| and we can have these discussions publicly, and everybody will know what our thought process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| but it is what it is, and this is how we deal, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| So, I mean, my hat's off to you for, you know, I hope you're not apologizing for us doing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| I mean, that's just what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I mean, I don't want to be here, but it's the only way to get it out and get it out on the table and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| You know, once again, George and I agree to the extent that we really need to discuss these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| and, in fact, we have discussed especially the removal of the pension plan from the city charter briefly in some of our other discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3070)|
| 0:51:18| If you'll recall, the initial, one initial thrust was to simply close the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| and then work under Article 2, Section 225, which already allows the city to set up a pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| but both of our attorneys, Rob and Charles, both opined that we couldn't do that without going through the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3094)|
| 0:51:42| or de-chartering, as I recall, so I think we really do need to talk about both these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| In the interim, the second item, the structure of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| we can take some action, either interim or permanent or whatever we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| and I hope that we will look very closely at that, whether we do it tonight or later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| but I think to come up with, at least in the interim, some sort of an advisory board that helps us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| especially people like me and the mayor that are on the board, to make sure we understand and pose the correct questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| that's vital and very helpful to me or whoever might be serving on the board, whether it be me or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| I'd like to welcome Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| We were just about to adjourn with one of the briefings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| I lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| I mean, these are obviously, go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| No, no, no, you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| I was just going to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| As I think I heard Finbar say, with regard to getting advisory assistance for the pension board, item number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| nothing restrains us from doing that on some ad hoc basis, whether it be via ordinance or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| During the interim law, we said that if the major driver here is let's not infuse the ballot with too many charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3179)|
| 0:53:09| which is an important thing to do because a number of people in the community have expressed concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| and we want to ask ourselves, are we taking excessive risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Are we choosing the proper means of investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| And Finbar raised the question, is there enough information for people on the board to even understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| what the implications of the decisions are on the investment approvals that are recommended by our outside advisors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| So I think it's healthy that we do something on that, even if it's an interim basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| In the next two years, it might be a permanent basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| It might turn out to be a perfect solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| There's a lot of business on the pension board that doesn't include that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| but the best investment advice and sound structuring of investment advice is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| On the third one, you know, I've heard two arguments so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| I've heard Councilwoman Palmer say, well, the voters get to choose and decide if that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| They make decisions, but the reality is they make decisions based on the 300-word description on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3247)|
| 0:54:15| and whatever they pick up in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| We sat here for six different weeks or seven weeks talking about different levels and parts of these pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| and it's obvious that not everyone has access to that level of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| Maybe that isn't enough to make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| but the merit of what Mr. Wallace is saying is that there are some things in the pension plan that need evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3274)|
| 0:54:44| adjustment, addressing that don't work well from hopping in two-year jumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3284)|
| 0:54:52| years when there's a statewide or even a plural election going on, so you can put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| And secondarily, can you disclose enough information about what you're acting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| and the implications to really give the voters a fair shot at the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| or do you just leave them frustrated so they throw up their hands and don't vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| which was some evidence that things on the ballot that are in the nature of the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| receive less votes than some of the candidate positions that are selected by voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| And that means that some voters just don't have enough information, don't feel comfortable saying yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| don't know if they're doing good or harm if they say yes or no, and refrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| And so the decision often is made by a very small number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| whereas I suppose you could argue that between the nine people that are on this panel, this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| that they've got to stand up in front of the voters at length and say that I am your representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| and I've done what I think is in your best interest and what you're good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| But it's been argued that to the extent that there are changes that have to be made to pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| that the council's in a situation where it can hold hearings, it can subpoena witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| it can do what it needs to kind of unearth the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| I've heard a flipside argument from someone who said, well, is that going to lead to politics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| I think this is an important issue. You can't pick up a responsible newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| certainly a national level newspaper, and not see cities and counties and states around this country struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| really struggling, with how are they going to address their pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| and the cost of their pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| And it's going to take a lot of hands-on work, a lot of education, and a lot of effort, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3403)|
| 0:56:52| to address those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| And it's probably fair to say that it's a lot worse here in the sense of having an elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| actually bear the issues and make decisions that the taxpayers have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| If you had a perfect system where they could sit down and be a part of every discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| and understand it all, then maybe ballot letter, particularly, would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| But these subject matters are awfully complex, and they do need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| So there's some merit to item number three, and that is design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| design in the future, I suppose, a ballot question that looks to the council to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| and deal with this as another major and significant budget item that affects the life of everyone who lives in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| And if those budget questions come here to this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| they may be let off by the administration, but we're kind of the last bastion of defense of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| what happens to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| So there's a lot to be said for this body helping to make those kinds of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| I would be willing to look at the proposal in that regard and support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| I recognize that this may not be the year of the ballot, but there's a lot to be said for adding a little more flexibility than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3492)|
| 0:58:22| I think the subject matter is so complex, at least, that unless we have some way of better educating the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3502)|
| 0:58:33| before a vote is taken, they really can't be expected to make that kind of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| Unless we put in three or four page supplement to the inspector, urging them to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| giving them a chance to get their arms around it, I think they have to look to us and do their own work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you. I agree, Councilman Della Voppe, with some of the things you have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| that this is an issue that does require some intense study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| I think if it was on the ballot, just as the question right now, to remove the pension plan from the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| the knee-jerk vote would be no, because people don't have time to gather the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| I think if we really seriously look at this over the next 18 months before we would need to have it for the 2014 election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3552)|
| 0:59:22| I think that we could have an opportunity to work with the public, get input, educate people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| and make some sound decisions about how it needs to be awarded and how it needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| I do think that right now that public sentiment is not to give up decisions at the ballot box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3574)|
| 0:59:44| And I don't think that this would have much success at the polls, basically to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| do you want to, yes or no, remove the pension plan from the charter and give the decision-making to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| I just think that we would need this time to not just put this in the shelf and bring it back out in 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| but seriously look at this and get input from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| A number of groups, not just neighborhood groups, but a lot of different kinds of groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| to see where we need to go and what kind of education the public needs in order to make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| I wasn't talking about time. I was looking at a mirror to look at some timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| And, you know, I agree with that statement, too, Nick, and Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| One of the things that I may read this wrong, but, you know, this, we are elected to represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| And they trust us to do the homework and to do the diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| And four-year cycles, that's all you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| There's no contracts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| But, you know, my hope would be, you know, that when we've gone through a great process here, it's been so transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3646)|
| 1:00:54| there's been, we've heard from everybody, we've listened, we've argued, and, you know, robust dialogue, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| But my hope is that now that we know the direction we're going is that everybody will get in behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| And because the worst thing that can happen is it doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| And then we're right back where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| So, I mean, just as one councilperson, I mean, I've been on this board a long time, and, you know, I've got my tail kicked on many occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| But you just lose, you fight your fight, and you go on about your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| But I hope that we can be unified when we move forward with this because it's obviously, as we all know, it's a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| And it's going to take, we need to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| We need to sell it to the public because they're going to look to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| You will get so many questions about once this starts being printed in the paper, tell me about what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| And you're either for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| You know, the democratic process has worked here, and I just hope we can move forward in a unified manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| That's kind of what I read into some of your statement there, but, you know, with a little sprinkling of my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| But do we, on this second issue, I mean, is it necessary to do a straw poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| or are we just kind of kicking the can down the road, so to speak, or what are we, where are we at on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| I'm a little lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I will say I don't want to kick the can down the road, but I think on these two, we're going to have to have more public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Among ourselves and among the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| These are two issues that I very much want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| I think we've got essentially a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| We've got to vote on something to put before the, so I think that right now is going to be very awkward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3760)|
| 1:02:48| and probably not very clear, whatever we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| But this is something I don't want this council to pass on at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| Right after the November election, we need to then continue to address, as Councilwoman Palmer indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| and not let these items kind of drift aside and don't wait until six months prior to the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Let's work on it and come with some stuff prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| and make sure that the involvement has occurred and move with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Yes, I would just like to tell Council, if it is your wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| I can commit to you as Mayor to bring back a recommendation for an advisory committee, board, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| who would advise the Pension Board and Council on our investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| so we can work within the stuff that Councilor Gilbert just mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| But we can bring that back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Again, that would be an independent committee that advises us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| and separate from making it part of the Pension Board at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| That can still be considered within two years from now, or for the ballot in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| Councilman Steger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| I just had a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| So if we're making them voting members, we need a question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| And if we just make them an advisory committee, we don't need a question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| We can create an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| I like the idea of something coming forward to set this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| For one thing, it gives us some time to see what the committee really needs to be doing and not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| so that if there is a time that this goes to the voters to make these people permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| or those seats, voting seats on the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| that we really understand what the role needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| and what kind of background qualifications and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| Because as we sit here and talk about this, one thing may be going through our mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| and then when the business gets to the road, we see that it needs to go in a little different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| So I would personally welcome something in the form of an advisory group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| and then see where that goes and see what needs to be done to make that a strong thing before we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| But again, going on with Councilman Saunders and some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| this is something we really need to keep on the front burner and not slide back and keep looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| And Councilman Wallace, I appreciate your bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| It is something that is too easy to discard and we'll worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| As Scarlett O'Hara said, we'll worry about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| We don't have that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| You asked about a straw poll, so on questions two and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| I think we could probably not do a straw poll since I don't think we want to try to rush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| and get that on there now in the upcoming ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| So we'll have some time to move forward with that or discuss it a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| I think it's probably good to have, as Councilman Wallace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| I'll use the word professional advice on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| That's probably a good idea if we can do it in a good way, in a good manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| We don't want to eliminate the employees or the representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| Other employees on the board don't want to do that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| But certainly it's not going to hurt to have some professional advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| because this is some weighty issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| So that would be good and I applaud the mayor for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| we could have that advisory board or some type of board that would be helpful, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| But I don't think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| You asked about a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| I think we've got a bulldog and a champion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| We've got two of them and I don't think this is going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| And with the mayor, you know, her statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| I'm rest assured that it will come back in the proper form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| and we'll have plenty of time to vet it and do the diligence that's needed on such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| You know, these are obviously large issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| So unless there's further comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| No, I'm agreeing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| I mean, I'm agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| Let's put together an advisory board and, you know, see what difference that can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| and let's keep talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| If not, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| I thought on the third item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| there actually is a little piece of that in this hybrid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| that those gentlemen are working on writing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| because wasn't there something in the COLA that had a limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| and it was subject to council finding funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| In other words, there were partial reservations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| where some one or two of the levers could be tweaked by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| So there is that possibility of doing that because we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Under public forum, first up is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| Could you give your name and title, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| I am the president of the general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| I'm going to reserve part of my comments until we get into these other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| but I did want to ask, and you've basically answered that question, why the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| We appreciate the fact that you have conceded or agreed, not conceded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| agreed to delay any actions on removing the pension from the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| We do feel that an advisory committee would fill the role that is needed at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| for the investments and look forward to working with you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4124)|

| 1:08:59| I want to thank you for your time and your thoughtful discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| You know, we're a little skeptical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Employees are obviously a little skeptical about removing the pension from the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| I don't think that's probably a big stretch here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| but I would like to take a second and remind you of what you've already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| that's really addressed a lot of these issues that you're trying to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| and I understand these are huge issues, but the changes you've made are substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| The investment policy going forward, just with the numbers that you're using, is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| The amount of money that you're matching and putting into the front to fund the program is huge as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4178)|
| 1:09:47| You've recently made a decision to put an active city council member on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| and you've got an administration that is obviously digging in on this issue and hitting it head on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| So I think you're going to see going forward, and it's going to take time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| it's not going to be easy or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| but you've made deliberative, substantial change on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| And while I don't like all of them, but I can applaud the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| and say that don't sell yourself short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| You've made a lot of, or recommended, and I assume you'll probably vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| and hopefully affirmatively, next Tuesday, but you've done a lot of work already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| and you've addressed a lot of these issues in great detail already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| So I'd like to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| And I guess some of these things, if we push too hard now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| will probably have some effect, it would make employees apprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| So I appreciate the fact that you're taking some time to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| because when things move real fast like that, when lots of change moves real fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| employees are concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| So I'd like to take time and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Joel Goucher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I'll yield my time back, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120606?start=4274)|
