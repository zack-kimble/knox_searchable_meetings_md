| 0:05:49| that we have, and I would like to welcome Commissioner Nancy Barger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| who is on her way, I'm told, from the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=353)|

| 0:06:09| and she didn't want me to mention her name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| but Director Brooks at some point will be leaving us in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| So if she's not here next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| I just wanted to say thank you, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| for all the great work that you've done in the Planning Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| and working with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| The last meeting being my first meeting as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| I failed to mention one important note, and that is I want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Commissioner Pat Phillips, who gave us two good years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| two great years of service as chair in this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| and he did a great job, and I just want to be like Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| So that will be my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Chairman Hill, that's going to be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| At least you've got the same haircut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Chairman, you're getting close up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| You're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| I certainly am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| And lastly, and I would say importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| I want to read a proclamation on behalf of the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Knoxville-Knox County Planning, and the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| on behalf of this going for our long-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| long-serving commissioner, Dick Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| And Dick, if you would kind of make your way up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| I want to read this as you're making your way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Knoxville-Knox County Planning has a long history of thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| considerate direction provided by its volunteer planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| which was continued by the service of Commissioner Dick Graff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| and whereas Dick Graff originally joined the planning commission in 1987| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| when he served eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| We somehow convinced him to keep coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| including another eight-year term when he also served as vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| He has now wrapped up his third appointment on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| totaling 20 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| And I would certainly like to give him a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| I'm not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=492)|

| 0:16:04| Daniel Sanders, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| We would like to remove item number 35 from the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=967)|
| 0:16:23| All right, Mr. Sanders has requested item 35 be removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Chair will entertain a motion to approve consent items as read with the exception of item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Seeing no questions, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| First item on the agenda is item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| The applicant is Castillo Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Location, southwest end of Carla Drive, south of Conda Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Tract information is .73 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Present plan designation and zoning is GC, General Commercial, CA, General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| Proposed plan designation and zoning is LDR, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| RA, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| This is one report and will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| So the staff recommendation is approve the sector plan amendment to LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Low Density Residential, because it is compatible with adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| And then the motion two will be approve the RA, Low Density Residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| We have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Would the applicant like to go first or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| I would defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| The opposition will have a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Whomever would like to speak, you could step to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| My name is Keith Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| My name is Keith Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| I'm speaking on behalf of my mother, Beverly Rogers, 7705 Bridget Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| Our concern for this is that it's going to be split in two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| In this subdivision is half-acre lots, minimum half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| It's got a curb, but when you go down the road, it's all curbs, brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| What he's proposing is two houses on that .73 of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| That's what he's told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| That's our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Our concern also is that it goes at the end of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| that they can extend this over to the other lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| You see there's 987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| So could they extend that over, that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| and make a thoroughfare through there to Michael's Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| Who do we talk to about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Would staff like to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| To my knowledge, this property adjacent is not owned by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| I know nothing about future plans for those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| They are currently in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| They're currently low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| so residential would be feasible there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| See, this is what I'm saying is this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| he's wanting to split it into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| So it's .37 of an acre and .36 of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| All the lots in this subdivision are half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| That's why we bought in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| There's a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| They're brick homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| He's wanting a driveway to be shared by two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| There's none in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| So what you're saying is it's compatible with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| If you look in this subdivision, if you come off of Michael's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| he has an easement to come off of Michael's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| but I understand it's going to cost a bunch of money for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| so it's easier to come off of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Well, on that .73 of an acre, if he wants to build a brick house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| the subdivision doesn't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| We want it to look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| The values of the homes are going to go down if you put something in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| there not like the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| That's what we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| I don't want to take away any time from other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| but I bought that in that subdivision for a reason for my mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| so she could die in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| I told the gentleman, I'm not going to tell you what to do with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| land, but I'm worried about the .37 of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| is what we're really worried about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| and that that road doesn't go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Is there any way that that road can go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| I had talked to you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Can that road, can they make that road go all the way to Michaels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| off of Conda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| That would be a question for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| That would be a question for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| I would defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Beller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Vice Chair Uten, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Before the other residents get up and speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| and I'm not trying to talk you out of your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I just want to make sure that you guys understand that that piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| property is on commercial right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| That's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I don't have a problem with it being turned in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| but I have a problem with it being turned in to low density residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| I just wanted to make sure you knew it was on commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| My name is Judy Bibler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| My address is 519 Carla Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I'm right across the street from where they're planting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Would you care to repeat your name one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Judy Bibler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| I don't want to repeat everything that Keith just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| but my main concern is when the four builders 50 years ago built this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| subdivision, they made a small wedge piece of land in there so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| couldn't build, continue to build back in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| so it would be a cushion between us and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| We've already got Freddy's and all that out there on the boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| It's 464 feet from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| You put in one driveway, two homes, property values are going to plummet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| and that's not why we moved into that nice, quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| We'd like to keep everything consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Like he said, if they want to do one house, one big lot with one driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| we don't oppose it, but not the way he's planning it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Any other opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Would the applicant like to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1397)|
| 0:23:27| The only thing I have to say is my name is Frankie Ramos-Castillo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| Address is 1581 Pine Ridge Road, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| The only thing I have to say is I just wish for the approval per the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| recommendations, and I'll defer the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I want to echo what Commissioner Uten was speaking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| that the area is currently zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| So when I hear the opposition speak about concern for the noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| for it getting busier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| I can't imagine two residences generating more of that than a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| So I am much in favor of staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| and would make a motion to pursue staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| So we have a motion by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1478)|

| 0:24:51| Make a motion to approve RA low-density residential per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1491)|

| 0:25:02| Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| The motion was made by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1510)|

| 0:25:34| Present plan designation and zoning is agriculture and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Proposed plan designation and zoning is rural residential, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1546)|

| 0:25:57| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| and hillside protection because it is consistent with the development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And the second motion would be to approve the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| up to 12 dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1575)|

| 0:26:50| We've asked for two dwelling units per acre, which is not an added density as to what we could put on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| It's just when we get planning, we can organize the lots a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| I have approached, talked to some of the neighbors, the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| and Nadine Porterhouse with Gibbs Planning Advocates about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| We've presented our own concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I know we're not at the concept stage yet, but we plan on bringing a sewer up Fairview at the developer's cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1639)|
| 0:27:30| We plan on putting approximately 30 houses in here, which 12 of them would be larger homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| five of them to front ridge view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| The center of this we plan on putting a pocket neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| It would be smaller homes, about 1,600 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| All these would have rear garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| It's a little different concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| We'll put a pavilion in with two parking places for food trucks with access to water and electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| On the bottom side, this lot has a panhandle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Down on the panhandle, we put the detention basin under the power lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| and have walking trails and community gardens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| I'd just like to ask for staff support, as they've already said, that we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1694)|
| 0:28:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1705)|

| 0:28:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1719)|

| 0:28:46| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Or Commissioner Eddie Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| We have other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Commissioner Smith, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Well, my question really goes back to the second one, and I apologize, I'm getting old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| so I may have heard something that you didn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| I think you said up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| They said two, so I just want to make sure it's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Just wanted to make sure that was clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Can someone from planning speak to the comment that came in about a historic structure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| is on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| It may not be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Ms. Albertson, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Our historic preservation planner looked into that, and it was not a property that was noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| in the 1983 historical survey of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| You know, there could be some historical significance to it, but it has no listing or eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1784)|
| 0:29:52| listing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| You good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1798)|

| 0:30:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Sorry, we're just going to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| We plan on keeping that home and renovating it, and there's a well house, a garage, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| another shed out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| I think the house was built in 1910, and we do plan on keeping that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| We want to present, when we do our concept, that we're going to call this the preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| at Sharp's Corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| It actually goes back to the Civil War, so it's kind of an interesting history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Is that where we're left off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1836)|

| 0:32:48| I'm sorry, Mr. Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Just to make sure we're in proper order here, do you want to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Go ahead, Mr. Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| After spending 30 years in the Marine Corps, my wife followed me around all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| The only thing she wanted when I retired was to come home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| So I brought her home, and she is sentimentally attached to this place, as am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| It is a property that's been in her family for almost a century that's adjacent to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| I do have eight photos here that I would like to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| which will depict better some of the things that we're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| With the chairman's permission, I'd like to approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| If you'll take them over there and just circulate them around, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Mr. Chairman, we came here recently today with a plan of opposing this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| We're asking for consideration that zoning be reconsidered for low-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| Currently, there are only three houses on this road, as you'll see when the pictures come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| It's a very narrow country lane, not wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| unless someone wants to drive off in a ditch or back all the way up to where they started from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| It's located at a very, very busy intersection because of a raceway service station located on the corner of the property with Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| It's the site of numerous vehicle accidents, posted 45-mile-an-hour speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| where traffic usually goes through there in excess of 65 to 70 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| We have other proposed buildings being done adjacent also that's going to add to traffic congestion in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| We have met with county and state elected political representatives in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| We've also talked with CDOT representatives in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| and we know that we're not going to get any type of traffic control device such as red light or speed bumps or rumble strips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| or anything like that in that area because too much traffic coming in and out of Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| But the traffic is a nightmare, and it's a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| As you'll see from some of the pictures we've taken that are non-rush hour traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| we literally take our lives in our hand every time we cross the highway and try to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| When my daughter was a student at Corns High School, on numerous occasions she had to turn right, go to Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| make a U-turn, and come back to be able to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| And it's not gotten any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| We have a lot of development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Solway is a quiet, sleepy little community, and Hardin Valley was a big farm area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Now Hardin Valley is a robust residential community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| and we're stuck in between Oak Ridge and Hardin Valley and having to deal with all the recurrent problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| The other thing is we like where we live because it's peaceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| We're surrounded by woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I'm surrounded on three sides by TVA and one side by CSS Railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| Everything else that's in between, we have deer, owls, wild turkey, all kinds of animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| It's close to the lake, so we can have an opportunity to relax and enjoy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| And we just like to see our quality of life change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| I know one of the tenets of this planning commission is to address transportation and quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| and we're asking today that you consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Adding and feeding more cars on the Jim Jones Lane is going to make it almost impossible for anyone to cross the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| It will literally take us 15 minutes to get across the day to come here for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| That's just to get in the median to make the turn to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| And so that's one of our major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| The width of the road and the maintenance of the road is also another concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| because with three houses there, we get very little attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| In fact, the water that services our house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| we had to pay almost $10,000 to get a ditch open for West Knox Utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| to run water from the highway down to our two locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| So, yes, are we emotional about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| We certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Are we willing to work to make this work for everybody concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| But we do not want our quality of life to be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| We'd like to see the builder allow for some type of buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| I know acreage is money, but we'd like to see some type of buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| between where we reside and where this proposed land development may take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| And with that, I'll yield any time to my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| She won't stay today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you, Commission, and thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Holifield, for your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| and thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| And we don't want to impact anyone's way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| This property right now is zoned Planned Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Mr. and Mrs. Holifield's property is also zoned Planned Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| Their property is to the south, across from Jim Jones Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| so there is a natural separation between our property and theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| And this request is to go from one planned zone to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| to downzone it from Planned Commercial to Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Under the current Planned Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| this property could be developed for any commercial use that is allowed in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| You can do a building up to 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| You could put outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| You could put indoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| You could put a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| You could put a factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| You could put just about any commercial use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Our proposal, Turner Homes, we know, is a local builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| They're located here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| They do single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| and they also do townhomes between 1,200 and 1,600 square feet of attached townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| to meet that missing middle light-touch density market that this community so desperately needs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| And this property would be appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| As staff has noted, this is a downzoning from commercial to medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| and medium-density residential is a natural transition from the more intense commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| to the low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| So this is the ideal location for this type of medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| I understand why three homes might not get very much attention for road improvements along Jim Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| Once our property is developed, there will be road improvements that will be associated with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| and that road will improve because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| It also has frontage on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| We're not at the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| We haven't designed stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| We haven't designed all the access issues yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| That will come next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| And since that's a planned zone, Mr. and Mrs. Holifield will have an opportunity to look at those plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| understand what those impacts are, and address any concerns that they have at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| So we do understand what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| I will give them my card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| They can reach out to me as we go through this planned process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and we will meet with them and talk to them about what their concerns may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| and see if they can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| But at this stage, this is appropriate to change the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| and to change the zoning and ask that you support staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Given the fact that the property is currently zone commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| I think staff's recommendation to approve medium-density residential is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| as a transition between the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| So I will make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| Seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Chairwoman Thain, a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Make a motion to approve PR planned residential zoning up to 7.25 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| based on staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And we have Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| What's the threshold for requiring a transportation study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| 750 ADT, and that would be determined when they come through during the development plan review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2487)|
| 0:41:37| if they propose enough units that would meet that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| I believe for an attached development, it's about 75 units, some around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| The only question I have, and this will be for engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| looking at this, you know, looking at the picture of how narrow it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| what do you think is the realistic process of widening that road before that development is complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| Yeah, I hadn't been out on that road in a long time, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| but we would want to see, at least up to their insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| a minimum of 20 feet wide to allow for, you know, two larger vehicles to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| So a minimum of 20 feet wide from their insurance to the south, to the west, to Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2540)|
| 0:42:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2554)|

| 0:42:51| The applicant is Jeff Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2571)|

| 0:43:12| Existing land use, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Staff recommendation is to deny sector plan amendment to GC general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| because it is incompatible with surrounding land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Second motion would be to deny the CA general business zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| because it is inconsistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2614)|

| 0:43:59| Is the commission, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Okay, we have a motion for a 30-day postponement by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2643)|

| 0:44:17| 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| Moving on to agenda item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2666)|

| 0:45:00| Proposed plan designation zoning, mixed-use special district, hillside protection, general residential, technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2700)|
| 0:45:11| Existing land use, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment to MUSD NWCO-4, mixed-use special district, Saddlebrook, and HP hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2718)|
| 0:45:29| because it is a minor extension of the district and consistent with development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| The second motion recommendation is to approve the RBTO, general residential, technology overlay zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2734)|

| 0:46:03| Seeing no opposition, would you like to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2763)|

| 0:46:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2810)|

| 0:47:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| We've been here for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Item 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Applicant is Isaac Pennell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Location, north side of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Tract information, 5.75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Present plan designation and zoning, low-density residential, hillside protection, and low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Proposed plan designation and zoning, general commercial, hillside protection, and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Staff recommendation is to deny the sector plan amendment to general commercial because it is inconsistent with the character of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| And the second motion recommendation is to deny the business and manufacturing zone because it is not compatible with the surrounding low-density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2887)|
| 0:48:18| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I'm the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Isaac Pennell, 5212 Villa Road, and I'm going to defer my time to the owner of the property and their legal support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2909)|
| 0:48:40| I am not aware of any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Chairman Hill, which is extraordinary in my experience, I don't think I've ever seen 51 comments on an application and none of them being in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2922)|
| 0:48:51| especially a project I've been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| But I would ask if anybody who's here in support would stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| My clients are Eric and Taylor Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| They own Knoxville Martial Arts Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| They are in the process of relocating their business from its current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| And I want to set the stage because they acquired this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| When they acquired this property, they had no intent to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| They had contracted with the owner of, if we can use the map there, there's a small sliver of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2965)|
| 0:49:38| It's not, I think we're on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| You'll see that small red commercial that's right there north of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| It's adjacent to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| And then where the arrow is now at CB, that parcel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| They had contracted with who they thought was the owner of that property to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| They bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Then they realized they didn't buy that property, even though they thought they did and paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| There's other actions that are going to come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| But we put them in a pickle because now they need a place to relocate their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| And the commercial property they owned, they had to buy the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| It was part of a package deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| They wouldn't sell them, you sell loosely, the commercial property without also selling them the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| So now they own the residential property and no commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And they've already terminated their, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, they have to open up their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| So they thought this is an extension of the existing general commercial sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| This is an extension of the commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| We will take, they own quite a bit of residential property back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| There was lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Let's just take that frontage and rezone that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| We know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| We're going to put a business on it that's going to have two businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| It's going to have their martial arts academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| And there's also going to be a dog grooming business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| And we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| It's a small building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| And I think it was in the, they did submit a comment to it, but I can pass this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| This is their comments where they kind of just showed their concept as to the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| But it's a 250 by 80 by 16 building along the frontage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| You know, there's some topographical challenges to the property, to the north and the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| So they wanted to zone enough of it so they can make sure they have enough room to plan for their parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| and for their stormwater detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| I mean, that's good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| That's the only reason they asked for the five acres instead of something smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| There is a sinkhole to the northeast corner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| but that's not going to affect where their footprint is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Now, I understand staff's justification for denial was there's a lot of commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| in that area that is underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| And that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| They actually tried to buy some of that property so they wouldn't have to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| and were unable to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| But they don't own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| They own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| And this is an extension of the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| There is some, Commissioner Adams, I appreciate your concerns about the historic property there to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| the Flanagan property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| They've sat down with Mr. Flanagan several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| He has no objection to them going in beside them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| He's not here today, but he's not submitting anything in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| They had the conversations with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| They know they're going to be good neighbors, and he doesn't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3147)|
| 0:52:35| Regarding a sector plan justification, at least half a dozen times this year, if not more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| I've heard staff and their recommendations will say specifically to recommend a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| because it's a natural extension of an existing sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| And that's exactly what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| So I'll let Mr. and Mrs. Turner speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| There is justification for the sector plan amendment and the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| and I ask that respectfully you approve it under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Hi, my name is Eric Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| My address is 360 Teresa Ann Drive, Seymour, Tennessee, 37865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| This is my wife, Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Her job is to make sure I don't miss anything and tell me when I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| So technically we own half an acre above Maryville Pike that is zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| The problem is so does someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| We have a contingent agreement right now to purchase the land outright so that the title goes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| and is free and clear, and so we're really asking for an extension of that half acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| that is zoned already commercial to just abut the five acres we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| I think Mr. Mullins covered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I just want to say those people are my people and I'm their guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And if you get 51 comments, they're all positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| They all say what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| We don't just teach martial arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| We don't just teach fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| We don't just teach skate stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| We teach people how to live a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| So that's what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| It's what we've done everywhere for the last 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Okay, May's been around that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| We've been in a bunch of different communities, and we've always made every single one of them better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| We want to be good neighbors here just like we're good neighbors at the Pease Building to everyone in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| That's just all we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Mullins, my love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| We have 10 seconds, go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Yes, I guess we have 10 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Hi, I'm Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Traffic won't be a problem because of our hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| We're bringing in internationally renowned people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Could you, I'm sorry, Ms. Turner, could you please move to the, and if the commission doesn't object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| I'll give you 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| I'll try to run through this quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| First, yep, we've talked to Fred and Anne, the Flanagans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| They actually have a buffer lot between the zones that they've already purchased, so that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| They're not opposing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Nobody else is, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| All the plots for sale along that line are completely unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| We bought the Pease furniture thinking we could redo it, but per codes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| that not every building you can just redo and move right into it without a huge financial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| We're hoping to move, like, the Fancy Paws from Minnesota down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| I have pictures of who Suze is and what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| She's one of the top 10 groomers in the whole United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| She won't be bringing lots of traffic, but she wants to bring her business here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| And parking won't be a problem simply because of our hours and how many people we have, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| We can go into that further, but I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| I think some folks had their lights on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| I want to state really clearly because I'm the person that asked about the historic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| And my reason for doing that is because this rezoning and sector plan request has nothing to do with the quality of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3339)|
| 0:55:50| the persons, the great work that is being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| And I want to make that incredibly clear because our task as commissioners is to look at the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| not the business that is at the moment potentially going to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| Because whatever the zone is, whatever the sector plan is changed to, that's what everyone has to live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3367)|
| 0:56:15| even if that business for some reason needed to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| And so all the uses that exist underneath that zone are the ones that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| So with that in mind, I'm very concerned about the changing of this area from residential to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3384)|
| 0:56:36| To Mr. Mullen's point, there are lots of commercial properties along that stretch that are underutilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| I think is a kind way to state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| And I understand that's not the property that these persons are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| But from a land use perspective, we cannot get that area back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| We cannot get historical buffers back, even with one property and Mr. Flanagan's kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3415)|
| 0:57:05| Whatever could come in next might not be the great business that this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| So for those reasons, I am supporting staff's denial of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| Can I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| Okay, so we've got a motion to deny by Commissioner Adams and we've got a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| We still have some other lights and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| So, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I don't think I've ever seen a situation such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Most of the time somebody is asking to zone commercial from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| and there's a whole herd of people in here against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| And now we've got a herd of people that want to allow it to go commercial rather than remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3470)|
| 0:58:00| I agree with Commissioner Adams for the reasons that she stated, that it's a very difficult decision for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| So what I'd like to ask of staff, is there any method or any means of a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3489)|
| 0:58:19| that could be allowed on this property without rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3499)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner, I'm not aware of any specific to this type of use in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| It's currently zoned, is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| So the only zone that would be allowed for them to do what they want to do would be rezoned to what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3518)|
| 0:58:47| That's currently clearly articulated in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| You might be able to consider neighborhood commercial, but this use isn't defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| so there would have to be a use determination by this body in order to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| But I'm hearing that they have two different uses, so we just need some additional exploration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| I would concur with Amy that it could be considered as a special use in the C-N zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3545)|
| 0:59:19| I'd almost be inclined to postpone this thing to see if there was another way to get this done without rezoning it to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3559)|
| 0:59:32| We could have some more discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| If I could just comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| I appreciate neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| I think that was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I think there's square footage limitations on neighborhood commercial that we would exceed with what we would need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| For martial arts businesses, they need wide open spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| and a 5,000 square foot building limitation would not be conducive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| So that's why neighborhood commercial wasn't considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| The problem, guys, is I would love to see this happen, because obviously the neighborhood wants it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3601)|
| 1:00:09| It's a very quality thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| I'd like to see it happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Because of everything else that could be there, and looking in long range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| there's a lot of decisions that our government has made over the years that they didn't look long range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| They didn't think about what's going to happen 20, 25 years from now or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| There's a lot of things that can happen under this zone that's been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| that have nothing to do with what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| I don't see that we have any way we can rezone it to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3636)|
| 1:00:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Vice Chair Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Yeah, Ben answered one of my questions about the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| I was going to dovetail that into why are you asking for such a big piece of property to be rezoned for a couple of tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| Is it for slope, grading it, getting it in, big building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| or is it why are we trying to do such a big piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Because this is a stub road backing up to a railroad track, and it's got right-of-way in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| I was almost thinking if you left all the stuff to the left of this piece residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| and just kind of wedged something back in there towards the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| then that might be something that I could even—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| Am I allowed to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| I don't want to jump at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Go ahead, Mr. Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| The reason that we didn't put it right next to the train tracks is there is another large depression there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| that we're having geologically surveyed that could possibly be a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| Also, there's a very sharp downgrade to get to that railroad track, as you'll see by the topography there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| So we basically asked for quite a bit of land, knowing that two portions of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| that portion there and the sinkhole up to the top northeast, aren't usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| And we know they're not usable, so that's why we asked for the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Now, we could have tried to move it around, but we just thought it would be more reasonable to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| Commissioner Schilso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| So what's the square footage limit on neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Do we have that number, or is it based on the size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| It's 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| Does the city's neighborhood commercial have the same limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| Yes, I'd have to look up the exact square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| I only bring that up because this property is adjacent to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| and I'm just kind of with Jeff here on brainstorming on ways to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| because you could self-annex the property if a city zoning situation works better, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3761)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| One, the 5,000 square feet, is that per lot, or is that just a limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| Is any building in that zone maxed out at 5,000 square feet for the neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| For the building, yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| I'm just curious for you all, this is kind of brainstorming with everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| but if there's two uses, I wonder if it's possible to have two different buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| or two different lots that have those two different businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| But then my other question also for staff is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I know that there's a lot of mention in the report of this being low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| but with the fact that it's on Maryville Pike, which I'm sure is a major roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| and then also the commercial and industrial around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| would you care to just speak to the justification of why that's not an extension a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| So there actually is a bit of a separation, at least when we're looking at the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| There's a small piece of property between Maryville Pike and the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| so it wouldn't necessarily be a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| The frontage is also quite limited on Maryville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| because of the way the access currently is into that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| There are a number of commercial-zoned properties in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| and industrial-zoned properties in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| However, there's many that are underutilized and are currently vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| So rather than create another potential area that could be subject to vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3893)|
| 1:05:03| adjacent to these existing single-family residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| staff is recommending to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| And then my last thing, if we vote to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| and then they come up with a different solution and resubmit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| that's going to put them out an extra, I guess, month or two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| with the deadlines of when they need to apply for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| or whatever alternative they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| So what I would recommend is considering the postponement just in a way that—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| or considering asking for one just so that you all could take a closer look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| and see if there is an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Because if we vote against this, then you will have to resubmit within the deadlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3949)|
| 1:05:57| and it will probably delay you even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| You want to speak to that, Mr. Mullen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| Yeah, and they really don't want to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| given kind of the timetable they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| And I did notice, if we go back to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| the property that they own, they actually have a deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| the little extension there, that red property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| For whatever reason, the sector plan didn't capture that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| I would say that's an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| That was a mistake, and the sector plan should have captured that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| since it was zoned CB and has been for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| So they have a deed for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Somebody else also has a deed for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| They're trying to reconcile that by buying their property again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| from the person who has the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| So it would be an extension from the property they own to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| And they've really put the building the only place it can be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| on that little sliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| So they haven't asked for any more than is absolutely necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| to be able to operate their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Yeah, I think I'm with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| We love the idea of it and appreciate what you guys do for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| And we're just trying to figure out a way to make it all work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| But I guess my question is, that small stub road that is separating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| the residential track from what's the CB over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| I mean, is that right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Is that a private road or is it a public road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| That road is the old Maryville Pike before they moved it to go around the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| So I think it's either called Old Maryville Pike or Maryville Pike Terminus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| And it's owned on both sides, theoretically by me and someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| But, yeah, that road is the old Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| They used to go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| I guess the only reason I was bringing that up is, I mean, is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| and this would probably end up in a postponement situation as well, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| I mean, is there a way to even just close the road and do away with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| TDOT has closed it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| That's another thing that we're avenue of exploring and trying to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| variance for them to give it to us so that we can have a right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| Right, that's where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| You know, if the road was truly eliminated and those lots come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| then maybe there's a little more flexibility, you know, from a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| Well, if you'll notice, the lot extends past the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| So that entire road is encapsulated by that one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| So it actually technically abuts us without the road being a separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| point between the two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| So the road, as it was, I guess, is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| One more clarification question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| If that parcel, the small one, had of been in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| had of had the same designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| then would that affect your all's determination, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| Commissioner Huber, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Seeing no other likes, all in favor to deny, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Okay, call the roll, Ms. Kieran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Okay, so yes is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4163)|

| 1:09:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Commissioner Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Chair will entertain, excuse me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| Nine, aye, three, nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Nine yeses, three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Okay, so nine to three, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Chairman, make a motion to deny CB business and manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| zone per stash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| We've got three, three, nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Same, same three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Did you get those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| The same three, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Commissioner Browning, Commissioner Roth, and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Motion carries to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| I think Commissioner Adams described that very well in the sense that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| we have to look at this a little more narrowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| And so I guess you have the next case, the right to appeal to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| Moving on to item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| The applicant is Thomas Argas, Andy's Frozen Custard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| Location, north side of Kingston Pike, north of Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| Approximate acreage, .71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Zoning, CG1, general commercial, hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| Existing land use, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Proposed use, drive-thru facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| Staff recommendation, approve the request for a drive-thru facility in the CG1 zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| subject to the seven noted conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| We do, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| I'd like to defer, Mr. Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| I'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| Here on behalf of the applicant, Mr. Gas and his proposed use, which is Andy's Frozen Custard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4330)|
| 1:12:19| Andy's Frozen Custard is a national franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| I think it has about 130 storefronts across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| This would be the first location for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| If you're familiar with the area, this is located on Kingston Pike on the east side of Bearden Hill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| We'd submit that this is in the CG1 zoning district, that this is an appropriate use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4359)|
| 1:12:49| Based on this location and this area of Kingston Pike, it's one of the more heavily trafficked corridors in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4369)|
| 1:12:58| But it's one of those that doesn't experience a lot of the traffic bog downs that some of the other heavily trafficked areas experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4378)|
| 1:13:09| largely because of how wide the lanes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| They have shoulders, and there's a center turn lane that traverses through the entirety of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| Access to and from the property will not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| If you look in the general vicinity, right to the east side of us is Surin of Thailand, which is a sit-down-to-go restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4405)|
| 1:13:34| But then right next to that is Krispy Kreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| I guess down from that about 400 feet is Krispy Kreme Donuts, which has been there, my understanding, since the 70s with a drive-thru facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4417)|
| 1:13:46| That largely operates without issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| Considering the area, a drive-thru facility within the immediate vicinity seems appropriate and compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4429)|
| 1:14:00| The opposition has raised concerns largely to do with the shared driveway access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4440)|
| 1:14:10| I believe City Engineering has looked at the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| We've discussed with TDOT, don't expect any kind of issue with being granted access from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| This access shared driveway easement, from my review of it, nothing precludes this type of use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4461)|
| 1:14:31| There are no restrictions in that sense as to how many trips per day or how the traffic has to navigate thereon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4471)|
| 1:14:40| This property has approximately an 11,000 square foot building on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| I think everybody would agree that that building is not well suited for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| It's been vacant for about four years now, absent a seasonal pop-up at Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| It's remained vacant because it only really has one use as a furniture store, and that's what it was four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| That's why it still remains vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| The proposal here is to come in, demolish this kind of incompatible structure here, and build a substantially smaller footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4510)|
| 1:15:22| I believe 1,200, 1,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| I'm going by memory, so that may be wrong, but I know it's less than 2,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| It would have the drive-thru facility, and then it would have a walk-up window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| We have plenty of parking, and based on my client's experience with an existing Andy's location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| and his familiarity with the business, don't expect any kind of cross-traffic issues, stacking issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4544)|
| 1:15:56| that have somewhat been raised by the neighboring property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| In talking with my client, 75% of Andy's business takes place in the evenings at dinnertime and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4561)|
| 1:16:11| I submit that the veterinarian clinic, I haven't looked up their hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| but I have to presume that it's largely mainly during the week from an 8 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| therefore no conflicts in those traffic patterns and that congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| Again, I believe that this is an appropriate use in a demand area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| and that it would be an appropriate development and well-suited for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| and I ask that you support the special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4600)|
| 1:16:47| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Daniel Sanders, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| I am here on behalf of Dr. Amanda Pittman, the Animal Wellness and Rehabilitation Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| and Brown Bear Properties, and today I have Dr. Pittman and her husband, Stephen Pittman, with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| They own the property, and they are opposed to this special use application for a drive-thru facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| Dr. Pittman has been a vet in Tennessee for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| She has a practice in small animal medicine, surgery, and rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| For the last four years, it's been located on the property immediately to the west of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| I visited that today, and her parking lot was full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| She's got a thriving practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| It is, you know, she utilizes her property, and not only her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| but she utilizes eight parking spaces from the neighboring property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| which is covered by the access easement that we're going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| I went there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Her parking lot was full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| There were a couple of cars parked in the neighboring lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| and while I was there, a German shepherd came out and was loaded up in a van that was parked on the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| So there is a need for those eight spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| Dr. Pittman is not opposed to an ice cream shop going in next door to her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| She is opposed to the drive-thru facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| The property, the applicant has said that the drive-thru facility is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| because there are other drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| You're tasked today with determining whether this particular drive-thru facility is appropriate at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| and I would submit to you that due to the configuration of the drive-thru facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| the drive-thru lane, the size of the lot, the narrowness of the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| that this is not an appropriate location for a drive-thru facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| due to the significant negative and adverse impacts on Dr. Pittman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4728)|
| 1:18:57| This lot is too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| To give you sort of a sense of context, this could be the smallest drive-thru in all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| The applicant mentioned Krispy Kreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Krispy Kreme is on a property that is over an acre in size, and it has significant frontage on two streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4749)|
| 1:19:19| Buddy's Barbecue, just down the street, is on over an acre and a half of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| Chick-fil-A, which is an infamous drive-thru, I think, on Kingston Pike, just a little bit further down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| constantly backed up into Kingston Pike, is on 1.42 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| This site is not an acre, but 1.71 acres, and it's just too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4778)|
| 1:19:50| It's got almost 100 feet of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| These other drive-thru facilities have much more frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| An important point, I don't believe that in all of Knoxville there's another drive-thru facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| that utilizes or must utilize a shared access easement in order to facilitate the drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4803)|
| 1:20:12| So that's the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| The size of the lot, the configuration of the drive-thru results in harms to Dr. Pittman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| The site plan here, due to the configuration of this, shows demolition and construction occurring on Dr. Pittman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| This is all outlined in the letter that I sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Figure 1 and 2 show the demolition and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Dr. Pittman hasn't authorized any of this on her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| The demolition also takes eight designated spaces for Dr. Pittman's practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| There was a 1983 access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| That access easement provided eight designated spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Those lots are along the back of the applicant's property, and they turn into a drive-thru facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| Dr. Pittman hasn't authorized any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| She hasn't authorized a modification of her easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| There are dangerous points of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Because Dr. Pittman's clients need to park on the other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| they're going to have to cross the drive-thru facility in order to access the veterinary practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Also, the exit to the drive-thru facility creates an uncontrolled five-way intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| and we all know that that's going to be a dangerous situation for pedestrians and for patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| Finally, violation of Section 9.3 F6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| We can see that this drive-thru facility is located in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| That's a violation of the principal use requirements for drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| If you'll let me conclude for just a moment, we also think that this is a violation of the West City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4917)|
| 1:22:06| I pulled this up on my phone just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| and I'll read to you from the West City Sector Plan where it references general commercial land use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4931)|
| 1:22:21| This category includes previously developed strip commercial corridors providing a wide range of retail and service-oriented uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4941)|
| 1:22:31| Such land use classifications and related zoning should not be extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| because of the adverse effects on traffic-carrying capacity, safety, and environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| Redevelopment of commercial corridors, including mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| should be accommodated under planned or design-oriented zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| I submit to you that this is a redevelopment of this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| and that it's inappropriate to expand the use into a drive-thru facility under the special use portion of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4980)|
| 1:23:11| when the sector plan says that those expansions should occur under a planned zone or a design-oriented zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=4991)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| I ask that you deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| If I could, Ms. Pittman, could she have one minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| Dr. Pittman, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| If Commission doesn't object, I'll give her one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| Mr. Forrester, we'll give you another minute if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| My name is Amanda Pittman, 7925 Ryan Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| My husband and I own Animal Wellness and Rehabilitation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| We also own the property and the building for which it resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| As a veterinarian, I treat animals and a general veterinarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| As a veterinarian, I treat animals in a general veterinary capacity, but my specialty is physical rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| As such, 75% of my patients are disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| They must enter our building from our back parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| and I do foresee a lot of stress on the owners bringing their pets back there with all the traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| Many of them have to come in on a gurney, or many of them are in dog wheelchairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| I'm very concerned about the safety of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| So for those special reasons, we're very opposed to the drive-thru going in in our shared driveway space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| I don't have any problem with the ice cream altogether, just the drive-thru in our shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5089)|
| 1:24:58| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Mr. Forrester, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Just to respond briefly, I can appreciate her concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| but I guess I would point out that this area has been for decades a high-intensity commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5109)|
| 1:25:22| It's operated as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| There's a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| There's a lot of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| There's a lot of trips to and from, and that's just the nature of the beast in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| And so, I mean, I can sympathize with her concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| but this area has been the same since she started her practice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5139)|
| 1:25:48| So that's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Unless you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| All right, let's start off with Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| I have a question concerning the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| I was hearing an argument that easement allows some parking spaces for the vet clinic, and it is an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5162)|
| 1:26:14| So in my mind, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's an easement that's shared by two different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| Each property owner has just as much right to use the easement as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| So you can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| It seems to me like this property owner, this proposer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| unless there's something in the easement that says the other person has to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| it seems to me like they have just as much right to use it as the vet clinic does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| I don't think we can use that as a reason to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| Thank you, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| Let's go with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| I hear what you're saying, but it seems like the uses are so different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| I have concerns about one being a very large use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| You would not be able to not only get to the Custard facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| but its whole enterprise is based around staying in your car and just scooting about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| So that seems like it would generate a much higher level of traffic on that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| than what the doctor's usage is, which is one patient, not multiple patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5247)|
| 1:27:35| but it's not the same sort of entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| They're doing something very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| So I think there is a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| I guess this might be a question for Mr. Sanders or the Pittmans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| Have you guys had an opportunity to talk with the applicant next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| Have you guys gotten together at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| The applicant has not the first time reached out to my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| I spoke with Mr. Forrester this morning and asked him if there was interest in any postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| We're up against some sort of timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| We invite cooperation, and your rules and your regulations try to foster that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| but we haven't received any communications asking about whether we approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| or if anything could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| I guess the only thing I was thinking is I've seen a lot of concept plans in my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| and there's sometimes another way to fix a problem with a little bit different of a layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5318)|
| 1:28:45| I guess my question is I wonder if the applicant and the neighbors got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| Is there a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| I don't know about sight distance and how the drive-through is working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| functioning like that from a civil perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| but just throwing it out to possibly postpone for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| I think you're going to have, if you're talking about highway access with TDOT's access standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| they require that you be 20 feet off each property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| Mr. Sanders represents the property owners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| They're 50 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| The topography is pretty extreme, I think, on Mr. Forrester's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5364)|
| 1:29:32| So I think those are big challenges, and that's why you're seeing that shared easement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Let's go with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| I'll start off by saying I generally don't love drive-throughs because I like walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| trying to focus on pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| But I will say specifically in this case there are a lot of empty buildings on this portion of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| and it is a very car-heavy part of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| So I think that the drive-through makes sense to be for business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| And in regards to the comments from the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| a lot of those comments are regarding the functionality and the practicality of the drive-through itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| and the easements, and that's not for us to determine here or to be judges on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| That's something that code enforcement will sift through and work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| and believe me, our engineering department will 100% sort through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| and run through it with a fine-tooth comb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| So I think that it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| It's within their rights, and it seems to meet all the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| So with that, I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| We've got a motion to approve by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| We still have more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Thank you, Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| My question is for Andy's Frozen Custard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| What are your hours, your business hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| Tom Gass with Andy's Frozen Custard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| I'm the franchisee for the Knoxville-Sevierville area, and I live in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5491)|
| 1:31:41| Our hours of operation are 11 in the morning until 11.30 in the evening, Sunday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| Friday and Saturday we're open until 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Right now that's our summer hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Normally we'd be 11 in the morning until 11 at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| and during school time after summer, 11 to 11, Sunday through Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5516)|
| 1:32:03| and Friday and Saturday we'd then be open until 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| And I just want to clarify one thing, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| We're not a drive-up only facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| We're drive-up and walk-up to windows in the front with a patio up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| And so I just wanted to clarify that because somebody had mentioned that it's a drive-up only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| and there's confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| So do you have any locations that do not have a drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| That is a big part of Andy's Frozen Custard, if you're familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| I don't know if any of you have been to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| We just opened our location out in Sevierville, Tennessee, Dolly Parton Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| We're right next to McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| Our frontage is 100 foot wide on Dolly Parton Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| and we're almost the exact same footprint as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| We had to do detention ponds there because it was originally farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| but we're almost exactly as deep and as wide as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| and the facility runs well with the Dunkin' Donuts next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| and we share an easement in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| They have a drive-through just like this, too, and it runs perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| And the drive-through is in the back, just like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| The drive-through runs around the other way, but it's basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| You go to the back of the lot and you come back down through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| I guess I have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| I know that this opposition came in kind of last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| I don't know when you guys recommended the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| Did you know of the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| We had published our staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| and then received the comments from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| I'm just looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| So this property is totally appropriate for the Custard Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| I think the question really we need to focus on is whether the drive-through is allowed in this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| and that's the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| Am I understanding this right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| That's what we're trying to decide in our approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| is whether the drive-through is to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| When I look at the standards under the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| there's only six standards that they require the Knoxville and Knox County Planning Commission to really consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| assuming everything else is approved, which is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| And I'm looking at number C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Yeah, C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| It says the use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood where it is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| and with the size and location of buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| So I guess my question for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| knowing that here you have a neighbor who's saying that it is not compatible with her building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5672)|
| 1:34:41| would you still go ahead and ask for approval of the drive-through use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5681)|
| 1:34:55| Is this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| I think generally we're looking at the existing land uses in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| and note that there are other drive-through facilities also in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| It is taking away an approximate 10,000-square-foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| and replacing it with a building that is approximately 1,700 square feet in size, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| so it's a smaller structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| You know, I would encourage everyone that's looking to develop property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| to work with their neighboring property owners to try to find a solution that pleases everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5733)|
| 1:35:41| But, you know, in the case of whether or not the drive-through is appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| as long as they're meeting the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| which is what this recommended approval is subject to, those seven conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| and that includes meeting all of the standards of the Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| You know, for those reasons, we recommend approval subject to those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| You know, I believe that staff has got this one right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| You know, I think it's a very appropriate zoning for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| You know, if you're going to be off Kingston Pike, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| traffic is just going to be part of your life, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| I've seen a lot of, you know, these other legal documents and easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| but I'm pretty sure it's not our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| I mean, we're not supposed to interpret legal documents on this point, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| So having said that, I think it would be a great asset here, and I would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5808)|
| 1:36:58| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| Yeah, I tried to – well, I was almost going to buy that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| when it came on market a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| and I guess my issue at the time with it was, as I looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| a tractor trailer or a box truck would have to pull onto the vet property now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| to back into the loading dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| So there's a cross-access easement issue today to use this building the way it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5843)|
| 1:37:31| And, you know, there's a Petro's down the street that's on a tiny lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| There's a Dunkin' Donut on a tiny lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| I think there's a new Kentucky Fried Chicken on a tiny lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| And it's absolutely not ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| but I don't think tractor trailers back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| and how all that was supposed to work is much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| So I'm with Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| I think it would work, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| I just wanted to add that I think that the usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| the custard shop and reusing an existing property would be fantastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| definitely something that's there all year long rather than a pop-up shop would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| But it seems like there is some missing chunk of collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| or discussion between the applicant and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| that it has been really wedged in to this one usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| or one physical positioning on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| that maybe there is some other thing that could be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| So I would be supportive of a postponement if it doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| I'd like to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Mr. Sanders, it seemed like your biggest concern was the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| If this happened to be a full-service restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| or let's just say a quick-service restaurant without a drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| you could potentially have more volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Let's say there's a new concept in Knoxville called Super Chicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| It's much like a Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| It doesn't have a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| It's about, I don't know, 25 to 3,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| and that wouldn't concern you or would it concern you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| It is the drive-through facility that concerns us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Okay, so the drive-through facility is going to be on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| So explain to me if you had a bigger restaurant with as much or more volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| why that doesn't concern you but the drive-through does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| Respectfully, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| a majority of the traffic for the drive-through facility will be on shared property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| and a portion of the drive-through traffic will obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| and naturally be on Dr. Pittman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| This shared access easement extends from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| It doesn't extend to the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| It terminates about 55 feet from the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| At that point, there's no more access easement except the access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| that Dr. Pittman's clients have for the custard shop property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| and her eight parking spaces over there that are being demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| in favor of a drive-through facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| In my letter that I submitted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| there's a figure in there that shows a small triangle of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| that is going to be constantly trespassed on by the custard shop patrons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| that are entering the drive-through lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| Also, the configuration of the dumpster pad back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| invites a constant trespass on Dr. Pittman's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| and that's outlined in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| The question about the drive-through facility is not whether it ticks all these little boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| You have the authority under the special use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| to determine whether this is going to significantly injure Dr. Pittman's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| and if you determine that it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| you have the authority to deny the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| Like I said, we're not opposed to a custard shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| or some sort of restaurant business in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| We are opposed to the traffic, the congestion, the noise, the fumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| and all the other attendant impacts that a drive-through facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| located smack dab between the two buildings is going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| for Dr. Pittman's clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| for traffic for both businesses that are using the same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| That five-way, uncontrolled five-way intersection down near Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| if that were, it shouldn't be designed in any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| than you would think a road intersection would be for safety purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| It has five entrances, and one of them is skewed to an angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| That's a dangerous thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| That's shared property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| That's a dangerous impact that it will have on Dr. Pittman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| It's not just on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| It's on shared property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| Dr. Pittman has as much right to that as the custard shop does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| and the custard shop can't harm it more than Dr. Pittman would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| because it's shared property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| They have a responsibility not to injure one another in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| But many of those concerns that you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| it appeared you would have that even without a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| The smells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| The drive-through is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| The drive-through is intended to constantly circulate cars through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| and that's why it's a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| It naturally causes adverse impacts to surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| That's why you have to have them behind the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| That's why they're a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| and there are not only the principal use standards that you have to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| but also there's a special use that you go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| and if this causes harm, which we have shown that it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| you have the authority to deny it, and we would ask that you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6205)|
| 1:43:32| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| We've got one more light here, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Let me just ask this question, and pardon my ignorance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Can we add an eighth condition that just says that the applicant must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| from the end of the easement to the dumpster pad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| put a curb in so that traffic can't cross that triangle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| My initial, I'll let Director Brooks speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| I would defer to City Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| We would want this body to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| There's another way the landowner can limit use of the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| Hence why I'm asking the question out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| All right, seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| We have one in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6275)|
| 1:44:45| Well, I thought we'd be out of here in an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| We blew that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220811?start=6290)|
