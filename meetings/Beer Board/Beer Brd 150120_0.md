| 0:07:19| I hope to see you all there real soon. Okay. And I can give a private testimonial about how good they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=439)|

| 0:09:12| Right. Okay. Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| Thumbs Up Market, 2400 East Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| Okay. Officer Lyons. We have no applicable record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Ms. Dyer. We need the approval from the health department and the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Do I hear a motion? Move to approve, pen and file documentation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| All those in favor? Aye. All right, thank you. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| All right, we now get to the Walgreens portion of the agenda and we have a substantial number of Walgreens that are changing managers and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| And so do we have one person to speak for everybody or are we coming up individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| Okay, whoever is supposed to speak first, come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| I'm going to pass the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| If it would help speed things along, I could speak for everybody. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| Sure. My name is Doug Hamburger. I'm the district manager for Walgreens here in the Knoxville area and I'm representing all the stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Okay. I'll call each store independently. We'll do the routine you've just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| I think everything is complete, so we'll be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| I wonder if you could tell us what's happening to require all these reapplications. Just corporate changeover? What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| Yes, it is. We actually bought two companies in Europe called Alliance Boots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| And that triggered the name change that we have with our company because we want to maintain our recognition here in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| but we also wanted to maintain that recognition over in the U.K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| So our official name is going to be Walgreens Boots Alliance and that's what triggered our name change with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| We won't do anything with the signage on our stores or any of our advertising. This is mainly a legal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| And on the corner of happy and healthy, this would be the happy part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| Yes. And I'm actually representing three of the stores, so if you'd like me to read those first or wait for your order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| We have an order that we follow. The first one is at 1725 West Cumberland Avenue, Officer Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| No record. Ms. Dyer. We need the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Okay, and if I understand correctly, you have all those permits, is that correct? Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| All right. So we can dispense with that part of it. Okay, do I hear a motion? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Is there a second? Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| All right, thank you. The next one is at Walgreens at 2400 North Broadway, Officer Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| No applicable record. Ms. Dyer. Former permit. Okay. Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| All those in favor? Aye. Thank you. The next one is at Walgreens at 4001 Chapman Highway, Officer Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| No record, ma'am. Ms. Dyer. The former permit. Okay, do I hear a motion? Move to approve. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=728)|
| 0:12:26| Madam Chair, can I ask one more question? Sir. We still have in place the same managers that have had the task force training and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| How are we doing in terms of qualified people to sell beer in your various Walgreens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=752)|
| 0:12:42| Right. The only different manager than when we applied four years ago is our manager up on Asheville Highway, and he's a newer manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=762)|
| 0:12:53| But he has had the training and all that? He's done the training as another employee with Walgreens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| And it was brought to my attention that I do have one store that brought the wrong permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| Okay, we'll fix that. Okay, the Walgreens at 9536 North Shore Drive, Officer Lyons. No record. Ms. Dyer. The original permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=785)|
| 0:13:17| Okay. All those in favor? Aye. Oh, I didn't have a motion, did I? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| So moved after the fact. I said we'd move this along. Yeah, you did. I know, okay. All those in favor now? Aye. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| All right, this one is the Walgreens at 121 North Shore that's about to be obscured by a bank building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| Officer Lyons. No record. Ms. Dyer. The former permit. Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=819)|

| 0:14:11| Do I hear a motion? Move to approve. Is there a second? Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| The next one is the Walgreens at 5320 Clinton Highway. Officer Lyons. No record. Ms. Dyer. The former permit. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| Move to approve. Is there a second? Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| The next one is the Newcomer on the Block on Asheville Highway 4423. Officer Lyons. No record. Ms. Dyer. The former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Now we come to the only Walgreens in the 3rd District, 4423 Western Avenue. Officer Lyons. No record. Ms. Dyer. The former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=885)|
| 0:14:54| Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| The Walgreens at 7400 Chapman Highway. Officer Lyons. No applicable record. Ms. Dyer. The former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Thank you. I think that takes care of all the Walgreens. So you can turn those permits in at the end of the meeting here. We've got just a few more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you. Thank you. Whispers Banquet Hall has asked that we postpone until February the 17th. He's still deciding what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| But this brings up an opportunity for us to start to think about the fact that the city ordinance says that you must be 300 feet from a church or a funeral home or a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=925)|
| 0:15:43| The state ordinance, the state law is 50 feet. And this is probably the seventh case we've had this, well, not in 2015, but over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=943)|
| 0:15:54| Of places that have not been, they've been within the state requirement. And if they go get a TABC permit, then they can have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| So I think that in the coming days we're going to be needing to have some discussion about what we need to do if we need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| But we don't need to have that discussion now. But this was just an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| So do I have a motion to defer this to February the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| I'll make that motion. But I want to ask you about the church that is listed as the nearest church is Payne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| But you asked the question the last time about the Methodist church, which is in the same block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| Right. But it's not listed on here as the nearest church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| I understand that. But we'll be, when they go out to do some measurements, we'll be sure that we've got the right church that's closest to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| Well, I'll make a motion that this is moved to the next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| February the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Okay. All those in favor? All right. Thank you. And thank you for noting that change of churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| And the net effect is if he gets his TBA license, he can get a beer permit, even though he's close to that one church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Yes. City ordinance provides for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| Let me move to the heel of the agenda, the Knoxville Opera. And I believe that we have someone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| And this is for the Rosini Festival on April the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Officer Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| I'm Don Townsend, 5200 Mountain Crest Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Okay. Thank you. Officer Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| I believe there is no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| All right. Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Okay. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| All right. Tell us about the Rosini Festival this year that will be different from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Oh, it's going to be much bigger, actually, than it has been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| So it's going to be very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| All right. And what's the opera that will be at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| It's one that we have not done in 25 years. It's Verdi's Il Trovatore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Do they need us to sing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Okay. We need to vote on approving the Rosini Festival permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| And the last one is an addendum, and this is the Scruffy City Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Is there anyone here from Scruffy City Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| All right. Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Is this for their manufacturing permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| That requires a Department of Health's approval, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| It requires a number of approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| And the last time we deferred this, they didn't have the equipment in Knoxville yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| And I, frankly, haven't been there to know if they've got it in place now or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| Does anyone have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Okay. Then I'd like to move that we defer this to February the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| They had gotten a prior permit for beverages in the market square for an event, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Right. And they also have a permit at that location to sell beer that is not manufactured on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| But this is the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| This is the next step was for them to manufacture their beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| So we'll know by the next meeting how close they are or are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| I don't see any other business before this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| Anybody have anything for the good or bad of the order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Being no further business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150120?start=1171)|
