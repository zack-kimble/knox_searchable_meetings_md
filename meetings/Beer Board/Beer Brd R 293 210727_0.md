| 0:14:27| I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| I'm Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| And I am the executor of the will for the Our Place Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| I came in a little bit late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| But I have a court order from Chancellor Weaver that says that I can run the bar for nine months until such time as it's transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=884)|
| 0:14:56| So, sorry, I missed the proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Are you – I know that they have not – they don't have an actual entity yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| They haven't filed their charter or any of their organizational documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Are you thinking that you're going to postpone for a week, a month, or what's your –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I'll have Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Briefly, every so often, it generally doesn't come up at a beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| we'll have a situation where there is a conflict between applicants and some opposing –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| or people that are opposing for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| There might be, well, I own the lease or I don't have the lease and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| The beer board does not get involved in the disputes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| Those are left up to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| If an applicant meets the requirements of being granted a beer permit, they should be granted a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| And if someone is not happy, then they'll have to address that with the people who are getting the beer permit in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=958)|
| 0:16:07| because we don't know what has, hasn't, or may transpire in any court proceedings or any disputes between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=967)|
| 0:16:17| I recall one time many, many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| We had two people come in and they both literally weighed what they claimed to be the lease for the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| Well, obviously, there could only be one lease for the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| So I would caution and urge the members of the beer board that they should not be involved in private disputes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=993)|
| 0:16:45| and let them work their way through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Yeah. Just to be clear, I'm not necessarily opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I'm just asking if they had their documentation and what your intention was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1010)|
| 0:16:59| I know that there was maybe a sales tax certificate that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| Ms. Starbuck, can you give us your address? I don't remember if we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Sorry. My address is 6229 Baberly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And in general, I'm supportive of the efforts to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| I'm just saying I just came in late and didn't know where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| We've got a motion and a second to approve the permit pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| There's still sales tax registration and the LLC articles that are needed before the permit can be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| Okay. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| So it will be approved pending those final documentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We're about to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| If you vote that way. Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| This is for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| It sounds like it might be a good idea for us to postpone it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Is that something –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| There's still pending documentation that we're waiting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I have a copy of my LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Now, we haven't got our tax ID number, I guess it is, yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| But we do have a copy of our LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| I can show you that right now. I've got it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I mean, you could make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| But considering that even in this meeting there's been motions to approve pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1107)|
| 0:18:36| what's the difference between those two respectively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| And, you know, run the risk of becoming part of a private issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| You just sold me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| I have a question to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| So, Mr. Frost, just a point of clarification moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| So, is it appropriate we see the owners who are listed in the paperwork, who filed the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| is it appropriate for a person who is not listed on the paperwork that's come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| to bring court documents and those types of things in the midst of the proceeding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| They can, but that's not really one of the documents or pieces of information that are supposed to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1160)|
| 0:19:30| You know, if they come in with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| if I get served on behalf of the beer board with an injunction that the beer board shall not grant a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| I'll let you all know and strongly recommend that you don't violate the court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| But until that time, you know, you can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| The extent of my knowledge is what's happened here tonight, and it's the same that everyone shares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| But, you know, I don't know if it's in court, where it is in court, if anything has been applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| if anything has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1211)|

| 0:25:40| Our food is traditional, some short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1540)|

| 0:26:16| We closed the business to the public so we could cooperate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| the regulations that were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1584)|

| 0:26:36| It has a nice presence on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| It's a very interesting building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| I've been there since, I believe, 1908, and it was a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| And then it was Graham's studio for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| A lot of people took their high school pictures there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| And Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1614)|

| 0:27:01| And then we opened up in, well, actually, the Magnolia Cafe opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1627)|

| 0:27:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And please note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| All right, so that brings us to the addendum items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So I'll call on our first, our item 4A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Dollar General Store 591, see if they've got someone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1663)|
| 0:28:05| Yeah, I called him, and he will not be attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Mr. Frost, can we delay this to the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| That is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Since he wasn't able to be here, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| seems to me like it would be reasonable to delay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| You think he can be at the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Move to postpone for 30 days to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1712)|

| 0:28:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| All right, see you in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| Well, not you, but the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| All right, that brings us to our addendum items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Just a reminder to consider 90-day extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| since we've seen some delays in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| some of the approvals done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| So the first up is 5A, Ghosh Ethiopian Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1747)|
| 0:29:18| Do we have anyone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| Mr. Byrd, did we have some contact with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I haven't gotten a reply from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I sent a certified letter, emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| and I tried my phone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| I still haven't heard back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Have they made any progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Looks like they still need building, fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| and surrendering of the existing permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| I think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| I think it's the same situation as when the board voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I believe it's an ownership change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| It's transition, same folks, but different corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| or LOC organization, something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Well, Mr. Frost, what options does the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| have going forward with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| I see two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| First is to postpone it to the August beer board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Or if no motion is made, it will fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and they will have to begin the whole process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| So, Mr. Byrd, you sent them a certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| You've tried to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Email as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| But you've tried to call, and you got no one on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| But the restaurant is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Well, I've tried to call the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| I didn't call the actual restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I called the owner's number from her paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| and left a message, but didn't get a reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| I don't mind making a motion for us to extend $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| I think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Maybe somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Make a point to go get lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Motion to hear this in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| JN Investment withdrew their addendum item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| so we don't need to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| And the Brass Pearl picked up their permit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| All right, that brings us to beer board resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| So first up is establishing compensation for our beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| board hearing officers, increasing their rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| to $350 flat rate for uncontested items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and $175 per hour for contested matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Certainly over this year, we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| how involved our beer board matters that need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| contested or not take up time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| So I felt like it was reasonable to look at a pay increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| given the amount of time that we ask of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| for doing this important job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| So I'll open it up to a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| I've got a light on for Ms. Ryker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Yeah, I just wanted to ask a question for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| what the rates were prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| And the answer is $325 for flat fee and $150 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| So each of them are going up $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Going up just a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Important part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1965)|
| 0:32:45| I got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| All right, hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1971)|
| 0:32:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Next up is regarding the food hall ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| which we'll vote on later in the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| But this is adopting the forms that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| need for the common area food permit and subordinate retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| I'll move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Would that be move to approve hinting council adoption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| I think if the forms were to pass your board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| but then the ordinance change didn't go into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I don't think it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| But I'll let Mr. Frost correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2022)|
| 0:33:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Then I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2034)|
| 0:33:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2036)|
| 0:33:56| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| This brings us to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| And I'm glad we still have time before 6, so this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| Council member Singh had asked for a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| of the safe bar program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I don't know if you want to do a little introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2051)|
| 0:34:11| Just a moment, and then I'll introduce Catherine Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| So this is a safe bar program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| It's something that has been in Nashville for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And it's a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| It's an hour and a half training for hospitality staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| bartenders, anybody, owners of locations that sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| And it's a way of guiding them in identifying when there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| is sexually aggressive or inappropriate behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| and intervention on how to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Most of the time, people are worried about just marching up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| and saying, get your hands off of her right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| So this is talking about other techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| And it's been very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| And I'm really proud of bringing it to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| This is something I've been working on with Helen Ross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| McNabb, the Sexual Assault Crisis Center, Family Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Center, UT, the Health Department, and the YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| So I'd like Catherine Oaks to come and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2114)|
| 0:35:24| Hello, I'm Catherine Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Do you need my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| 200 Tech Center Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you, Seema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| So we are very excited to bring the SafeR program to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| and our community here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| As she mentioned, it has been in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| in the Middle Tennessee community for quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| and actually originally based out of the DC area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| So what this is, and our goal is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| a free and voluntary training to all venues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| are serving alcohol, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| nightlife and bars, so that we can train them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| on specific interventions, so bystander interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| as well as creating a safe environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| for possible disclosures, being able to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| circumstances that may seem like they are leading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| to an aggressive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Basically, it's really an early intervention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| So we want to teach the skills to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| able to identify a potentially aggressive situation so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| that we can prevent sexual violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Unfortunately, we know that over half of victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| of sexual assault report that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| were drinking at the time of the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Here locally, we see those numbers being even higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| And so this is a prime opportunity for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| to be able to offer our expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| with different community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Like I said, it's free, it's voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| it's a service that we will be able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| In addition to that, I think it's a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| to advertise for these local restaurants, businesses, bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| that they are a safe bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| We will be providing, for those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| have gone through the training, different window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| clings and other things that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| can display in their venue to show that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| have undergone the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| And we think that will just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| add to business for the organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| that they can go out and say, we've done this training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| we find this important, we want to provide a safe drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| environment for our patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| So my request of the Beer Board is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| that we have information for this in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| package for beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| It's a completely voluntary program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| but I would like to have the information available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| for new licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Ms. Oaks, can you tell us a little bit about how you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| promoting the program outside of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| talking about here at Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Yes, so we have been working and meeting monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| with different community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| We already have identified some local existing bars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| that will be some of the first venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| that we are going to train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| So basically, what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| is we're going to have a list of different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Our plan is to start more with the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and downtown area first, or any of those other places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| are interested, but reaching out to them directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| and letting them know about the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| that we will be offering free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| It's about an hour and a half training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| that can be accommodated to each of the different venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| to see if it would be something that they'd be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| We could have them come and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| at the task class for owners and managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| I can meet with you after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| and give you information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| That sounds really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| It would just be introduced each time there's a task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| I was going to talk about how you're promoting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| but I love that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| And I think that's an excellent way, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| not forcing anyone to do it, but making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| that they know it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| And I love that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| I see that it's been very effective in the DC area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| I don't know if we have anyone that signed up yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| that's completed the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Do you have anyone that's done it yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| So we're hoping to have our first training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| by this time next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| OK, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Mr. Frost, is there a vote that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| would have to take to add this to the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| It wasn't really on the agenda for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| I mean, Mr. Byrd's probably gathered the express intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| of council that they wouldn't mind that being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| added to the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Is that something your office would be amenable to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I certainly think it's a good idea to put it in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Thank you, Council Member Sink, for bringing this to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| and for allowing us to hear from Ms. Oves today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| All right, that brings us to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| So we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210727?start=2414)|
