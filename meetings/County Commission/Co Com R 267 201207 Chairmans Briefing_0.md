| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| All right. I want to welcome everybody. There's a few more I'm sure will be joining in. Welcome to the second of six chairmen's briefings, and I appreciate you all being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=30)|
| 0:00:43| If you, as you remember, the purpose of the chairman's briefings is just to give commissioners an opportunity to have a deep dive into bigger discussions and items that are hard to cram into our regular meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=43)|
| 0:00:56| an opportunity for us to sort of dig deep into a particular topic or area of note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| And today's chairman's briefing is all about transportation and TDOT partners are going to be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| And this is all about state transportation as it relates to regional and local transportation. As a growing county, it's certainly something we talk about a lot, our infrastructure needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=70)|
| 0:01:22| And certainly we have different jurisdictions to work through with our city and county partners, as well as Farragut. And then, of course, on a regional and statewide level, it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=82)|
| 0:01:34| So I thought it'd be a good topic to dig into and hope you'll have good questions from our team at TDOT and you'll see Dexter Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=94)|
| 0:01:46| He's the Region 1 project development manager, and then Steve Borden, who's a Region 1 director. And in the back there is Andrew from Team TDOT, who's helping run the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=106)|
| 0:01:57| And, of course, anything that they showed today, I will follow up and send that out to everyone soon after. So if you didn't catch something, then I'll be able to send the whole slide deck out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=117)|
| 0:02:08| Topics are still open for the next briefings in February, April, June, and August. So if you have any ideas, bring that. And I want to thank everybody who's here and who might be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=128)|
| 0:02:20| We also have E. Brad from Engineering and Public Works with us, and I think several others viewing through the live stream video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| So with that, I'll turn it over to our partners at TDOT and we'll learn more about regional and state transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| Thank you all, and the mic is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| All right. Well, it's an honor to be here. Thank you, Chairman. I have this opportunity to be here. Of course, obviously, we are all partners when it comes to transportation in our community, where we live, and we're thankful to be here and be a part of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=161)|
| 0:02:57| We're going to throw up a presentation. Andy is here just shortly. And with that, I'll kind of give you an overview of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| As far as the department, obviously, we're all living in a new world in times when you talk about COVID-19 and that it has impacts to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=185)|
| 0:03:16| We'll touch on that. I'll touch a little bit on what we do with the department as a whole, the transportation program that we oversee here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| And then we'll get a deep dive into projects inside of Knox County and in the surrounding area that are regionally significant, obviously, to all of us that live here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=205)|
| 0:03:37| So with that, I will get started. Starting out, one of the things a lot of times when we go out and talk, a lot of people want to know how this has impacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=217)|
| 0:03:47| Obviously, when you look at the traffic numbers, this is a graph that kind of shows where we were at earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| As you can see, going in earlier in the year, we were actually above where we had been the previous year. And then you see the drop as we got into March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=234)|
| 0:04:04| Obviously, where the majority of our funding comes from, the fuel tax between diesel as well as gas, is the vast majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=244)|
| 0:04:16| And so when you have less vehicle miles driven, it does have an impact on the financial side of how much money is coming into the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| And it does the same thing, because a lot of the money that we collect gets passed through to the counties for their road program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| So this gives you an idea of where we are in the major metropolitan areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| If you look here, this is a slide, real quick, just shows you how Tennessee fares with the rest of the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| We're a little bit above what the average is, as far as our impact has been a little bit less when you normalize it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| Still, there is a pretty good size impact to us, especially in the early spring, when you look at those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| This graph here will kind of give you an idea of the impact of what it was earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| When you look over the circle around that drop-off, that's that March area where we saw everything, April, March, when things started shutting down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=305)|
| 0:05:15| But if you look across, you have to get back all the way back to 2008 to get volumes that are somewhat similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| If you notice, for 2012-14, all the way up to 2019, we had a significant climb in the number of millions of miles that were traveled across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=322)|
| 0:05:38| So right now, we fell back several years ago when you look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| What does it mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Our fuel tax is correlated somewhat with the vehicle miles traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| That's going to have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| This is an older slide, but it sort of showed at the end of the year, in May and June, we were down about $45 million on the state side in our collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=354)|
| 0:06:03| The state revenue were funded at two places, with it being state and federal taxes, the ones that go to Washington and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=363)|
| 0:06:13| But we had been over, when you look through July through February, prior to the pandemic, of about $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| We did some administrative savings to tighten our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| And at the end of the physical year, we kind of really hit about where we expected to, knowing that this fiscal year, though, we would have to see those impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=384)|
| 0:06:37| Looking at it as we go forward, I think that when you start looking at what we're probably seeing, you're probably looking at this year probably about an 8% reduction in the amount of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=397)|
| 0:06:50| on the state side, moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| If you looked at the worst case scenarios that were early on, we would be looking at about $250 million in difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=414)|
| 0:07:05| We're not going to hit that mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| We should be $100 million or less in reduction of funds on the state side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| And we're doing a lot of things to try to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| And what that does for us, as you all know, we're a pay-as-you-go state, which is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| There's only five states left in the U.S. that are pay-as-you-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| We own all of our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| There's no bond debt anywhere on any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| We let projects to construction or whatever phase we're doing as we have those funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| And doing so during this pandemic, we have been able to weather it pretty well because a lot of our neighboring states actually had projects that were midstream and had to stop them even in the construction phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=456)|
| 0:07:46| Just because they didn't have enough money coming in to balance the books to be able to pay out expenditures, or they had to go and get some additional debt service to be able to pay that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=466)|
| 0:07:58| We've not had to do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| What it could mean to us in the future, you could see, and it won't be $225 million, but based on what we're seeing now, you could see an $80 million or $70 million reduction in capacity or big projects that might be delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=480)|
| 0:08:13| So you could see a project or two that could slide a year just because of us being a pay-as-you-go state, then that's, you know, if the money's not there, then we won't move forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=493)|
| 0:08:26| So, one thing we did this year, we requested $68 million in additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| It's one of those great things that happens, and we've always been good at the department, is being able to be ready to spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| The redistribution is basically us taking advantage of other states that didn't spend all of their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| I think, was it last year, how much did we get? $130 million? Yeah, $125 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| I think $125 million, $130 million is what we got last year, and basically what's great about that, that's federal money that was going somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| They didn't have enough state money to match or whatever that's left on the table, and then we get a redistribution, and then that's $68 million that gets spent in the state of Tennessee that would have normally been spent somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=542)|
| 0:09:15| We did have the FAST Act that was set to expire September 30th. They've extended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| The big thing right now is that we don't have a long-term bill in place, which does give us some difficulty that we could get on a continuing resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=563)|
| 0:09:32| If that happens, that means that we'll get so much money per day, and it will be a little bit less certain what that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| Obviously, we have an election year that we've had. You've got a lot of other things that's sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| We do think that reading what's going on in Washington that we'll see some stimulus, similar to what the ARA-type projects were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| We did a bunch. If we have shovel-ready projects or projects that are ready to go in 12 or 24 months, then we'll be able to tack in some additional funding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=594)|
| 0:10:05| We do have projects that fit that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| It's one of the things that we try to do as a department as we get further into the project development process we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| We try to develop and have more projects ready than we have money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| That sounds kind of crazy, but to have them ready in case we have the opportunity for a redistribution like I talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| or if you see something that's similar in nature to what we had with the ARA money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| where there's money available, and then we can put those projects out the door quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| I'll do an overview of what we do here at the department in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=634)|
| 0:10:43| It's 24 counties, and East Tennessee is what we cover here in the Knoxville office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| We have a lot of different disciplines that are under this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| If you look on the project development side, which is what Dexter hits out of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| I guess starting out, we have the top. We have our own survey division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| We go out and do our own survey for projects as well as oversee consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| This is a LIDAR scan of a flooding issue that we did several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| Those are millions of points of data that we're able to go in and correct the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| At the same time, we have our own drones that are able to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| You're getting data that's good to less than a quarter of an inch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| which allows us to be pretty creative, especially the rock slides and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| that we can get a lot of really good data really quickly in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| The design section, we have a fully staffed design office that does in-house design as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| oversees projects from consultants that are doing workforce as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| Give you an idea of something. This is pretty neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| If you ever go to our website, and we can send you all some links here later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| but if you look at the Alcoa Highway Corridor, you're going to see a 3D model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| You'll eventually pretty soon be able to see the whole corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| We can actually share a few of the videos that haven't been edited for the voiceovers yet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| are done. This isn't a video. It's actually a 3D model of the whole project, which is pretty cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| that you can run through the whole project. You can stop anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| When we did the public meeting for this particular project, we were the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| state in the country to ever do a virtual public meeting in 3D. People could walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| They could actually look at their own property with 3D goggles on and see exactly how the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=749)|

| 0:12:40| stuff that you'll see that we do in a lot of our large major projects. It's the direction we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| going. We're not there completely yet. We're doing on some major projects, but not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| We also have an environmental section. Obviously, we do our own permits here and apply a form to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| lot of environmental boundary work and things like that. It's a big part and component of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| developing a project when you're in that early NEPA environmental phase, get that early design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| done, and then we move into what the next thing is, right-of-way. Obviously, we're a large real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| estate company in the sense that we buy and purchase a lot of right-of-way. We sell and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| lease a lot of right-of-way as well. There's a lot of work that's done anytime we're widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| a project. Obviously, we have to go out and purchase right-of-way for that. We also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| a utility section that works on the coordination. Anytime, especially when you're building or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| widening a project, one of the most difficult things, kind of like remodeling a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| If you build a brand new house, it kind of sits by itself. When you start remodeling or adding on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| I just added on to my house about three or four years ago, there's a lot of things that you find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| along the way that you didn't expect to be there. A lot of the other stuff is that way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| One of the things we do to de-conflict projects, time is money, is that we do a lot of 3D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| modeling. As we move further in the 3D world, we can do this virtually. As you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| this is a lot of underground utilities on a particular project. You're doing underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| utilities, several different types, along with our storm drainage. The software goes in as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| de-conflict with our partners in the utility world. We go in and de-conflict those spots ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| of the contract, obviously, and refine the plan so that we can make sure that we're not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| a signal footing into a water line or a storm sewer doesn't cross into the water or sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| as well. It helps mitigate some expense on the back end by doing that. It kind of gives you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| rough idea of some of the things that we do there in the project development side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| The other side is operations. When you look total in the department, we have about 850 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| in Region 1. About 110, 20 of them are in project development. The rest are in the operations side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| which is a pretty large portion. One of the things you see a lot is the construction side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| of the house. That's our inspection of our big projects, oversight of them. You'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| maintenance as well, traffic, safety, and incident management. I'll talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| about them in detail. When you look at projects, and this is an interesting slide, it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| right now we have around $740 million under contract in East Tennessee. Maintenance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| about $40 million on top of that. This slide here kind of gives you an idea. This is not by cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| but by the number of projects, because obviously a drain and pay job is going to be a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| expensive than a maintenance job. When you look at the number of projects led,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| that gives you the distribution with safety and intersections and enhancements. We'll talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| that a little bit more when I get to the traffic section versus the bridge replacement repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| general maintenance contracts that are on our roadways, state industrial access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| which is a great program. It's that last mile to a project, so to speak. I guess not exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| always a last mile. That's kind of the way we say it. It allows us to go in and help when people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| have economic development opportunities in both urban and rural sections of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=962)|
| 0:16:12| Looking at some of the technology that we're doing now, pavement marking and testing inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| it's one of the things when you do, we go around and we actually inventory all of our striping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| make sure that we've got the right reflectivity on new projects, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| knowing when it needs to be done again. We do that with actually a machine that's part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| vehicle now. We have dynamic message boards. A lot of those are actually tied to our Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Management Center, our health center, weather monitoring stations throughout, a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| that we do as well. All of our plans now are electronic, which is a big step for us in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| way. I'm still a paper person. I love paper. I still draw on paper. I'm not good at drawing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| the plan grid like Dexter does. I'm not quite there yet, but I do use it a lot. But we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| the ability to go out as we meet with people and actually do it in tablet format. Traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1019)|
| 0:17:08| signage, and marking. This is one of the areas that's really close to home for a lot of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| When you look at the communities across the region and throughout Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| at the end of the day, we're serving the public. This is a very integral part. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| do have a sign and marking office. We do a lot of stuff in-house, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| On top of that, we look at a lot of low-cost safety operation improvements. It's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| and y'all being on the county commission, you appreciate when you're able to stretch your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| dollars. We're the same way. Look, if I can make a huge improvement for less money, we're all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| doing that. Sometimes they're interim improvements. These guys are real innovative. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| got one project sitting over here to the right. There's this engineering graph that you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| here. This is on I-40, 75. You'll recognize it. What's really interesting here is there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| actually an identified approved back project that we're still going to do, but actually move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| further west to get a better opportunity. But that job would have cost probably around $40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| million to complete. What we were able to do with our staff here in the traffic office, we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| analyzed this carefully and went in and did a resurfacing, resigning. We actually went in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| reassigned the lanes, put a lot of markings down, and changed some things the way the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| And what we did is you see friction numbers up there, but basically we were able to reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| conflict points and actually greatly improve the functioning of that area, actually get similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| numbers of what the $40 million project would have cost. And we spent $3 million. So anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| that we can do that, we try to do that. It's looking at diverging diamonds and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| that and get really in the operational weeds there. The 407 project, I know a lot of us go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| to Dollywood and up there. And we'll talk, we got one coming to Knoxville, another one coming to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| Knoxville soon at a key area. But that particular project we were able to do inside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| right-of-way, start to finish from it being on the hood of a car at the Smokies parking lot to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| into contract in less than three years, no right-of-way. The cost ended up being $11 or $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| The other options were around $40 million and would have took us eight years to deliver because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1162)|

| 0:19:34| the things that these guys do, do a ton of safety projects. Anytime there's, and that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| things where we engage the public and our, as well as our partners at the county or wherever that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| we're working in all across the state is that people know their area better than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1184)|

| 0:20:00| these guys, they don't study it and walk away. We actually keep a database and see how well our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| improvements and safety improvements are doing. I mean, when you look at crash rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| where we have fatalities and very high crash rates and you make an adjustment and we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| want an alcohol highway and we went from a very high crash rate with fatalities in a two and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| half, three-year period, went to zero accidents. When you're able to do that, you save some people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| lives and that's what it's all about. I also work a lot with developers, providing safe and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| reasonable access. One of the things is protection of corridors. We spend a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| on corridors, sometimes with bypasses. And if we're not careful as an agency, us and our local partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| then a few years later, you can be, someone can be asking for a bypass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| I think Greenville's an example where we built a bypass and built another bypass and now we're back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1249)|

| 0:20:58| and efficiently as we do smart development at the same time. So, I mean, the big thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1258)|

| 0:21:29| or stop just in the urban areas. Actually, we do incident management all across the region. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| have a very aggressive incident management plan as far as getting roadways open and effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1295)|

| 0:21:47| and how it increases exponentially is very important to us to be able. And we have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| robust ability to go out and help law enforcement, emergency personnel. We've got a great relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1313)|

| 0:22:32| floods. You know, last February, we had 72 or 76 slides in East Tennessee alone. Many of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| were massive, you know, 200-foot fields. Roadways are gone. We're talking about 76 up in Hawkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1360)|

| 0:22:52| look at the response, we were able to do emergency contracts with our project development staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| operations staff, geotechnical, everybody together and get contracts out in a matter of days on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1378)|

| 0:23:14| We think about snow and ice and this next video is one that, it's a little bit of a picture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| what happened in Gatlinburg a few years ago. You know, most people probably didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| that the largest agency to respond to the Gatlinburg fires was CDOT. We had more personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| more people, more equipment there than any agency in the state. So, I think that what's next, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1409)|

| 0:23:50| We train for emergencies. We train for clearing roads in emergencies. We train for getting roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1430)|

| 0:24:05| the realization that, you know, you're in a real emergency and it's ongoing. This isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1445)|

| 0:24:31| trees out of people's way so they could get out of there. It was scary, but I knew it was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| that had to be done because, you know, you're dealing with people's lives up there. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| expecting the worst and when I got there, I seen some pretty, pretty bad things. Buildings, cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| ambulances, police everywhere. It was chaotic. There is fire all around us. It's hot. It's smoky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1488)|

| 0:25:01| 100 feet in front of me probably because of the smoke. That was as scared as I've ever been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| I guess, on the job at TDOT. So, you know, the firefighters are trying to cut the tree out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| the road. They get two or three chainsaws stuck in the tree because it's flexing so much because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| the way the wind's blowing. A contractor pulled up and said there was a tree down behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| So, at that point, we were blocked in, had a tree down in front, had a tree down behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| I'm trying to start my chainsaw and I hear a horn blow or I saw flashing lights or something. I turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1528)|

| 0:25:37| I said, you know, I don't care what happens to the truck, to their plow, get the tree out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| the road. We've got to get all these folks to Gatlinburg. That was a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| that was a scary moment. There was an oak tree probably four or five foot around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| and I had to use my plow as a weapon to move the tree. You know, chainsaws was hung up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| There was no other way to get around it but to use a plow truck and it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| in my eyes, it was scary. I was scared just like everybody else but I done what the duty calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| Bradley had to hit the truck or the tree three times with the truck to get it to move. He hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| it from about, he backed up about 10 feet and pushed it and it wouldn't move and about 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| and pushed it wouldn't move. The last time he backed up and got a little run and go and hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| the tree, broke the snow plow, broke at least the hydraulic lines on the snow plow. The plow was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| actually dragging after he pushed the tree out of the road and then there were sparks flying from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| the from the plow. It was dragging the road all the way to Gatlinburg but we made it. I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| on 42 years with TDOT. I've never been through nothing like this before. I mean I've been where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| houses are burned or building burned but now not where it's burning on both sides of you and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| can feel the heat inside a piece of equipment and you can feel the heat off of it and you so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| from it you know it's it's not in the road where you were at but it's it's so close you can feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| the heat. You just you know hoping that your equipment don't tire up on you because if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| equipment tires up on you, you got to get out on foot. You know you were rescuing folks but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| were also rescuing rescuers. You know they needed us to be able to get in and out. They needed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| to be able to keep the roadways clear to evacuate. They needed us to be able to clear roadways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| gain access to to get to where they needed to fight a fire or to rescue a group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| that were stranded. Yeah when you look at that you know that didn't happen by chance. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1650)|
| 0:27:39| something that we prepared for for years. We actually have what we call a strike force. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| put it together years ago. It's interesting. It was after Katrina when we wanted to go help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| Louisiana and we couldn't. We wanted to go but our equipment wasn't good. We didn't have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| You never want to go into an emergency situation and and you have to depend on anybody else. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| have to be self-sufficient or you're just a drain on everything that's there. So we went in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| started to develop equipment and training and each year we trained for different incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| Matter of fact the year that the Gatlinburg fires happened our scenario was a fire. Now we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| know we were going to have a fire later but that's what it was. But when you look at that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| in that instance we were fueling all the agencies. All the fire trucks they couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| fuel themselves. There was no power. We were the ones that were mobile full fueling. So we're able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| to go into areas and completely be self-sustaining and that came to fruition this year. It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| Lake Charles, Louisiana. Earlier this year when the first hurricane came through Lake Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| it was in such bad shape that Louisiana called for aid. We were able to answer. Matter of fact we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| sent crews down there and worked for over a week and it was amazing what we were able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| The thing was we fed ourselves. We took fuel ourselves. We went in and we were able to clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| a ton of roadways and debris to be able to get access for a lot of communities that were locked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| down and couldn't get in or out. You know that's what that is. It's part of our strike force and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| it's amazing the men and women that do this to see them answer a call at any time. Like I said we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| there were many times that we went in to rescue people. We had a condo condominium complex or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| chalets in the last place that wasn't burned. All that was left was a clubhouse and the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| that everything was burning around. The first people they saw were TDOG guys in a truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| and we got them out of there. So you know that's some things that a lot of times people don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| about. We're going to talk a lot about roads and bridges and everything else that we do but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| interesting that you quietly go about your business and those are some things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| I think we're gonna move on to project development. So this is a real detailed crazy thing. All these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| are steps to try to build a project. As you can see that's a really complicated development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| Lots of decision trees. A lot of different milestones in there. We'll go to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| slide. It makes it a little easier. Basically how it works right Dexter. You know you have a needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| assessment. I'll let Dexter kind of walk you through this. Yeah so like Steve said however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| it comes to be a transportation need is recognized by a community member, a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| public, a legislator, a mayor, a county commissioner, you name it. Projects come to be in a lot of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| ways. There are traffic studies through RPOs or our rural planning folks and our MPOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1835)|
| 0:30:45| metropolitan planning organizations. All those folks are doing traffic studies. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| once a project is identified as a need that's kind of the beginning of the project development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| And then we have three distinct phases here that get you to the leading. So the first phase is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| your preliminary engineering and that's all the engineering work from environmental documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| utility contacts, contracts, selecting alternatives, working through our environmental folks in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| NEPA process to identify how we are going to address the identified need. So that's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| engineering stage right. So you're saying this is how we're going to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| Once we have the problem identified and the need has been addressed with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1885)|
| 0:31:34| we'll move into the next stage which is acquiring the property needed to develop this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| whether it be a widening a brand new road or just new this new facility has to have space to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| on. That's when we move into the right-of-way phase. Right-of-way is not only buying property it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| dealing with our utility companies because as most of you probably know most utilities live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| within the public right-of-ways. It's a brief place for them to be so we have to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| with them every step of the way. How is our new improvement to a facility going to impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| utilities that are out there? How do we need to consider those utilities sometimes in the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| So that's one part of the right-of-way process but the most glaring issue in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| isn't again buying the property. So we start contracting with appraisers. We go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| negotiate with property owners to acquire the property and occasionally that is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1949)|

| 0:32:42| for the development of the project is moving into construction. So I guess what I'd like to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| across here is we fund projects in three phases. We fund preliminary engineering first and once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| moved our way through that part we start funding the right-of-way. After we work through right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| then we fund construction last. So what's important there is you don't want to lose the power of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| dollar. If we funded the entire project on the front end and it takes six to eight years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| develop a big project sometimes you lose the power of your spending dollar on construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| when you put that money in a bank account eight years earlier. So we try to spend all our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| on an annual basis but then when it's time for construction we'll take the power of the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| from that day to fund the construction. Do you, is there a mechanism in which you don't, like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2002)|
| 0:33:33| fund the person and they're doesn't, funding for the other, you have a concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:45| Sorry, go ahead, go ahead, try again. Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| It's true. Do you get the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2032)|
| 0:34:07| Yeah, we do fund each phase individually. I think that's what you're asking and we do that for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| reason obviously like you just don't want to tie that up. So we identify the project and say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| preliminary engineering needs assessment, NEPA, you know a big project that could be a full-blown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2057)|

| 0:34:29| categorical exclusion be shorter but we'll fund that section so if it takes two years to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| we'll fund that section. We typically won't consider the next phase in the same three-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| plan to make sure we, we don't want to have put a slot for funding this section and not be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| And then we'll come back and fund the right-of-way portion of it and if it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| 36 months to get right-of-way then we allow for that as we're looking at a 10-year plan to drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| construction in somewhere. Once that we have that right-of-way acquired, we have to certify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| with Federal Highway and if that's not certified, we don't have all of it, then that delays us being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| able to go to construction. We don't want to do that, we don't want to have a, we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| identify funding to get authorized and not actually be able to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| Yeah, is that, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| Yeah, I'll second. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| So go ahead and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| So now we'll get into investments that have been made. The first, first one there, a map we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2131)|

| 0:36:38| Hardin Valley Road interchange. That project's moving along at a good pace and anticipated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| the summer of 2021 completion. Stagger Out 62, that's a grain-grain project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| that Jones Brothers has. I think it's pretty much completed at this point. We're doing a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| of an intersection modification, so we're still hanging on to that job on Longwestern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| And the next one is Stagger Out 33, the Broadway viaduct bridge replacement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:13| We're well on in that project. It's been a long time coming. It was a very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| development project, getting the railroad satisfied with the designs and taking care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| all their needs. That completion date currently says in late 2022. So we'll get around to talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| about the construction projects on Alcoa Highway a little bit further. Steve, you want to take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| research and information? Sure. This gives you a map, and this is some of the resurfacing projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| around the Knoxville, Knox County area that you'll see here. If you look over to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| you get an idea of what we spend in a period of time. Now, what we do under resurfacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| and we'll get into a little bit later, but we do a three-year plan. But if you look at the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| investments, you get an idea of what we spend. Each year, state routes are resurfacing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| $17 million over that three-year period. The next section down, you're looking around $53 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2288)|

| 0:38:40| scheduled to be paved. As you can see there, we do have a portion of I-640 that's set to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| this year, this spring. We're having to do some railroad coordination that's going to push that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2328)|

| 0:39:00| Can you talk about the issue of the railroads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| Talk about the issue of the railroads? Is that what you asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| On I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Yes. Basically, what happened was, and I think I'm right, Dexter. We built those a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| We probably have agreements somewhere, but when Federal Highway came in and audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| they said, we can't find your agreement, essentially. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| It's agreement and rights to be there. Historically, we used to get agreements with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| the railroad to allow us to build a bridge inside their right-of-way, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| That's the case with I-640, is we've built a lot of bridges on railroad right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2375)|

| 0:39:46| you have to have an easement to be there. As part of any project, we have to certify the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| that we own it and have the right to be there. Obviously, we use Federal dollars on interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| resurfacing. To certify the right-of-way on this corridor, we have to prove and show where we own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2401)|
| 0:40:09| that either right-of-way or an easement that allows us to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| makes a right to be there on that property. We have to deal with this on every route that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| have. It's something that's come up in the past three years. As I'm sure most of you don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| dealing with the railroad is a very time-consuming prospect. It's not something where you just show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| up and say, hey, we've got this issue, we'd like to get it taken care of. It's a very iterative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| process to get ownership of an easement for them. We are working through that process with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| and it's just the way it delays projects quite frequently. It's something that's having an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| impact on us statewide. Each railroad is different as well internally on how they work through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| easement or access process. We're having to work through each of them differently as their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| internal regulations or requirements are there. It's a priority for us. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| you look at that 640 is the number one priority we have, but we're going to get one piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| and we'll probably the next year before we get them in 22, before we get the next piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| That being said, we're going to move out on I-40 and capture some of that on the west end that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| needs to be done in the interim. It was not originally in our plan for this year. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2487)|

| 0:41:49| painting, but there's a whole lot more that goes into that. It's asset management, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| did the same thing with our bridges as far as documenting. You look at total number of lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| miles and what we're looking at. This gives you an idea of what we have in each of our regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| across the state. There are four of them. When you think of it, you're looking at from region one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2527)|

| 0:42:22| that area, that quadrant is region four. That gives you an idea of the total number of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| that you have to take care of. This doesn't include the bridges, which we find to do as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| part of the resurfacing project as well. About what we do every year, we get about $235 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2552)|

| 0:43:02| on the assets themselves. It's broken down percentage-wise, budget-wise by how much we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| in each region. We do that on a smaller plane. When you look down inside of our sub-districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| inside the region that we work with, each of them have their own program to prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=2594)|

| 0:53:51| design phases of that project. We do have a planning report already in hand, so we kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3231)|

| 0:55:03| Drive, so we'll get that traffic separated out. Folks will already have made their decision prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| to going through the 640, 75, 275 interchange, and you'll be lined up to make this movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| a lot better, a lot smoother without having to weave traffic back and forth. Like I say, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| a lot to talk about here, a lot more than this meeting will handle. I just want everybody to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3321)|

| 0:55:38| working on this one at a pretty good pace. The next quadrant of projects is, I guess, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| first green project of this conversation is number five. This is the completion of a corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| an important corridor, coming down to Knox County. A lot of folks from north of us travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3354)|

| 0:56:05| Knoxville, where we've had three, I think, three phases. We had one in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| from the northern part of Knox County. This is the missing link, and we've done the one up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3371)|

| 0:56:23| to construction in the third quarter of the year, probably late summer, would be the best bet for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| that one. We are widening an existing two lane to a five lane, straighten out some curves and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| that kind of thing, but it'll greatly improve capacity through there and finish an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| corridor for growth in the northern part of the county and on up in the Union County as well for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3402)|

| 0:56:57| this is the eastern edge of Emory Road, heading out towards Corridor. It starts there, State Route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| 33 and ends at State Route 331. This also is a widening project going from an existing two lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| to a five lane, and we are really early in this one as well. We're in surveying. We have a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3431)|

| 0:58:08| approaching the mall. We're adding an additional right turn lane on this section and widening the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| ramp all the way back toward the interstate. We'll have a lot more storage capacity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| and improving some radiuses and adding an additional three lane through the next intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| up there. I think that's McDonald's at that intersection, and then it carries on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| through to the next intersection towards Food City and all those good things. On the other end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| that's 640 westbound exit. Yeah, right there, Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3523)|
| 0:58:53| Here we are adding an additional left turn lane. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| Yeah, that's the wrong approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3538)|

| 0:59:17| In reference to $200,000 per lane mile, does that mean if a road is four lanes wide, it's four times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3557)|
| 0:59:28| $200,000? Yes, and then let me give you a breakdown on that. That is for an interstate where I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| putting in a binder course or a structural two-inch layer plus an inch and a quarter. If you do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| regular just inch and a quarter D, you're looking at about $90,000 a lane mile. If you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3580)|
| 0:59:52| mill it, and a lot of times we have curb and gutter, that'll add another $10,000 to get you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| to about $100,000. We do thin lifts, two different sizes. One of them is 85 pounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| a square yard. For instance, a regular D of inch and quarter is 132.5 pounds per square yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| The thin lift is less than that. It's a three-quarter inch roughly lift. It's about $70,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| per lane mile. If our road's in pretty good place, we don't want to always do worse first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Part of increasing the pavement life is to try to get the right fix at the right time. I can do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| thin lift early on and extend the life of that thing 14 or 15 years versus letting it deteriorate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| for two more years and going in and spending $100,000 a lane mile rather than $50,000 a lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| mile. That gives you that. It is per lane. If you have a four-lane highway and you were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| an overlay of D only, that's $100,000 per mile per lane. It'd be $400,000 for one-mile four-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3651)|
| 1:01:00| roadway. Thank you. All right. Back on this westbound 640 exit to Washington Pike, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3660)|
| 1:01:13| see there in the light gray color, that's the existing pavement width. We're adding pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| width to the... It's not really to add an additional left-turn lane. I think we're adding an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| additional three-lane maybe. It won't be a shared left-through. It will be a dedicated left-turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3682)|

| 1:01:37| that intersection there for capacity and safety as well. Like I said, that project is set to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3697)|

| 1:02:17| there on the west end of town as you approach the paper mill exit. We're expanding the limits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| what we want to study there and what kind of improvements we want to make. We don't have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3743)|

| 1:02:32| towards. Next phase of projects here is project number nine. What we talk about is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3752)|

| 1:02:54| trying to figure out how we want to address the needs there. There are a lot. This project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| really looked at as a safety project, so our first priority would probably be to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| centered left turn lane all the way through this corridor. Then we will go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| there to see what other needs we can address. Kind of in that same vein, we have two more projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| there. The next one's on the list. Number 10 is just a little bit within the limits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| the number nine. It's two projects we already had going. Number 10 is from Evans to Burnett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| This project's already been laid to contract, so we're adding that centered left turn lane on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3809)|

| 1:04:09| with no center left turn lane. Just get that separation of traffic. Of course, it gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| people an opportunity to get out of traffic to make those left turns, so it's a two-phase approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3856)|

| 1:05:09| the COVID area that we're living in right now, so that's kind of put a pause button on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| this project in the sense that the next thing that we have to do is check that mark that we presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=3915)|

| 1:18:03| we do the brown one and we get it done, then traffic on Alcoa Highway would have to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| navigate the Pellissippi Parkway Interchange to get them back up on the existing Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| So, we made the decision to develop these two together, which leads to a two-phase construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| The seventh project on the list is there, I guess the teal-colored section. It's under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| construction now. It builds the interchange for Hall Road and State Route 335 along the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4708)|
| 1:18:44| and ties it back into the existing Alcoa Highway. So, that will receive the new relocated Alcoa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| Highway when we get there. Overall, we'll go into a bit of a timeline for this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| You see the first, we are already headed towards construction for the orange layer thing, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| behind that, the green, the teal, and the blue are already under construction. We're headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| toward construction pretty quick for orange. The two relocated Alcoa Highways, we're looking at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| 22 for phase one, and then we'll have to follow up with a phase two, probably in the 26 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| And then, about the same time, we'll go into the construction for the red section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| once we get right-of-way acquisitions finished. So, that's kind of the time frame and schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| for the Alcoa Highway corridor and most of the projects that are in the Knox County or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| greater Knox County area. I'm open to any questions you may have about any of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4777)|
| 1:19:45| We do have a couple questions. The first one is from Commissioner Sussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| On the Emory Road 75 North project, what's going to happen to the curb cuts that cause much of the problems there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4789)|
| 1:20:00| And that'd be the Emory Road interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| They're all wrapped. You have strong locks. You're going back to the diverging diamond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| Well, you know, the presentation may be regarding this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4808)|
| 1:20:23| Yes, we can send you this presentation. It doesn't look exactly like this. This crazy stuff doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| print out page by page, kind of like what you'd like for it to, but we can get you most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Yeah, we get this to you. But you can see some of the changes there where you're changing access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| there at Starbucks. I think that may be what you're asking. What you see is we're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| roads along the back to funnel people out to the intersection that has a signalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| there where the Kroger's is. So, when you're coming out of Crystal and McDonald's and all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| if you want to go out and turn left, then you'll come out to the intersection of their Connor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| If not, then you're going to be funneled to a right-in, right-out in front of those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| That cleans that up. You see the same thing at the pilot as well with the backage road there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| for a marathon, buddy's barbecue there, as well as the commercial bank. That'll help facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4873)|
| 1:21:21| some of that. There's just too much going on close to the intersection for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| there and effectively get traffic through. What the beauty of this concept is, a lot of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| drive it, me included, in the afternoons or in the mornings, it's just a bear to get down Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| and this intersection. This will be able to flush the traffic, not only on the interstate where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| we're addressing the backing up of traffic on the interstate, which is a dangerous situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| but it's also going to be one to flush at the interchange as well. We're going to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| get improved capacity and throughput there without as much congestion. It's going to be a really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| really good project. What this really does for you as a user is if you're coming west on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| headed toward the interchange, if you wanted to go south on I-75 in today's configuration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| you not only have to navigate all those different businesses with curb cuts and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| they're coming in and out of there, but you also have to go through two signals to get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| the southbound ramp. By flopping in the center there, by flopping the direction, you only go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| through one signal and then you have a free flow ramp going up onto the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| You don't have to go through one set of signals or one intersection to get onto that ramp. Of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| course, it's the same way going the other way. If you're coming eastbound, you don't have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| through one signal. That's how this thing becomes efficient. It cuts down on all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| conflict points that you navigate when you go through this interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4971)|
| 1:22:59| What's the conflict reduction? We reduce it by eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| It's an eight conflict reduction when you do this versus a traditional interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| You get the same improvements when you're coming off the ramp. When you're coming off the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| if you're going west, you only have to go through one intersection, signalized intersection right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| there. If you want to go east, you go through nine. You come to a yield condition, but as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5000)|
| 1:23:29| as it's clear, you have the freedom to just move on without having to stop at times. Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5009)|
| 1:23:39| I'm not seeing any right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5019)|
| 1:23:56| Good deal. I think that wraps up what we got, doesn't it, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Yeah. I think that concludes the presentation itself. Like I said, if there's any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| you have, we'll be glad to do our best to answer them. Got one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5045)|

| 1:24:30| working on this since July of 2016, and it's my understanding this is the only interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5070)|
| 1:24:40| where two interstates connect that aren't lighted, and I understand Commissioner Bright got involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| in October of this year, and I was wondering if you had any updates for us on how you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| going to be moving forward with the lighting of the intersection there of 75 and I-140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| I'm not sure if I have you have that, Daniel. I don't. I can check on that and get back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5098)|

| 1:25:45| I don't know if you have links to the fly-throughs or how that would work, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| those in attendance would probably like it as a good reference, and then those who aren't able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| to be here to look at it. So, if you could send that to me, I'll get it out with additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| information to everybody. We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5159)|

| 1:26:13| see is how much is going on in and around Knox County. In addition to all of our engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5173)|

| 1:26:38| encouraging to see all of the projects in the works. I know that it's hard to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201207-chairmand-briefing?start=5198)|
