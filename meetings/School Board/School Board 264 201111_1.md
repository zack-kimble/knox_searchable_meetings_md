| 1:57:59| and then on our own outside of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Our director, Ms. Elizabeth Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| has proudly led the madrigals for more than 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| in concerts and competitions across the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| During the fall semester under her direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| we are charged with learning more than 30 different songs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| We spend months rehearsing and polishing our performances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| in order to uphold the outstanding reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| we have within the community, all for our madrigal season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| Madrigal season typically occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| during the first two weeks of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| The madrigals, accompanied by Ms. Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| dress in 17th century Renaissance attire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| attire that we purchase on our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| and travel across the county sharing our talents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| and spreading Christmas cheer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| through our large assortment of carols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| Unfortunately, last week we were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| that we will not be permitted to have our madrigal season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| this year due to COVID-19 guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| and restrictions that are currently placed upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| While we understand and acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| the importance of these regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| we cannot help but feel unfairly treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| and held to a standard that is not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| of other programs at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| namely those of the athletics department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| One restriction is that we cannot sing or perform indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Where is the logic in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| When sports teams can play indoors without masks in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| we cannot sing inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| even while masked and social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Each venue has specific guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| related to audience seating and spacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| which would allow our choir to safely perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| In addition, as madrigals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| we will certainly follow the five core actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| as outlined by the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| We did comply with all of the guidelines necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| in order to perform outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| on the Halls High School football field on October 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| However, madrigal season takes place in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| We should not be expected to sing outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| in potentially frigid temperatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| while our audience, including elderly grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| must also sit outside in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Secondly, it has been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| that we are unable to travel for madrigal season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| due to the current ban on field trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| Tonight, I would like to have clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| on how Knox County Schools defines a field trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Last Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| did the Halls High School football team go on a field trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| when they traveled four hours round trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| on a bus to Bristol for a playoff game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| And what about the middle and high school basketball teams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| Are they going on field trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| when they travel to their games within the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| I assume the answer to these questions is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| these are not field trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| These students are required to travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| and participate as part of a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| As madrigals, we are responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| for our own transportation to and from our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| We do not travel by bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| or any form of Knox County transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| Our parents do not fill out permission slips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| We are expected to travel and participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| as part of our group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| Sadly, the only difference we have been able to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| between the madrigal choir and student athletes is money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| You can ask any student involved in the fine arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| we are all keenly aware of the disparity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| between the value assigned to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| versus the value assigned to athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| The sports teams receive money from the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| and sell tickets and concessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| to bring revenue back into the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| but we hold fundraisers in an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| to finance our needs fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| Every performance we put on and every venue we visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| is free and done for the sole purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| of sharing our gifts and talents to give immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| Our talents may be different than the student athletes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| but we are just as accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| and should be given equal opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Tonight, I'm asking you on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| of the Hoss High School madrigals and our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| not to take our madrigal season away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| We are just as worthy and as important as the athletes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| who train and play in their designated sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| To cancel our madrigal season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| while allowing athletic season to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| would highlight the politics of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| and what drives the decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Shelby Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7277)|
| 2:01:29| Thank you, if you could just state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| and county of residence, and then you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| My name is Shelby Wright, and I'm with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| Good evening, my name is Shelby Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| and I'm a senior at Hoss High School here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| I am here today to express my disappointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| with the guidelines that currently prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| our band and choral programs from performing indoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| and traveling to other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| I have been a part of the Hoss High madrigal choir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| since my freshman year, and singing is my passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Each year, the Hoss High School madrigals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| travel around the community during holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| spreading Christmas cheer to many churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| and holiday gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Our madrigal season is something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| and the community in general looks forward to every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| While I understand that there are rules in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| to keep us safe, I feel that these rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| need to be revisited and revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| It is extremely upsetting for those of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| in the performing arts to have to sit back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| and watch athletic teams participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| in the activities they love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| while we are deprived of that experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| in the name of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| I cannot understand why sports teams can get on buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| and travel to games when bands and choirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| cannot do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| Athletes can travel, huddle together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| and have all the experiences they love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| with some limitations, but the performing arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| have been cheated of almost everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Bands cannot travel to away games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| or do their usual halftime shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| and choirs cannot perform indoors, even with masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| As a senior, I have looked forward to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| and every season of my educational and choir experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| and to potentially have that very thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| that I am most passionate about ripped away from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| my senior year is unimaginable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| I plan to major in music in college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| and I consider the arts just as important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| as academics and athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| Music offers something incredibly important, unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| Music is a universal language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| that can bring us all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| and I think we can all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| that it's something we need right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| I find it hard to comprehend the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| that we are allowed to sing in our classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| with masks on, but we're not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| to perform indoors or travel, even with masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| It logically does not make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| especially when students like me witness athletes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| doing the very things we so desperately want to do ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| After months of sitting in my home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| waiting for the world to open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| one of the things that kept me going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| was the thought of my senior medical season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| and the ability to sing and perform again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| Singing is my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| I eat, sleep, and breathe music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| so when I learned that the probability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| of there being little to no medical season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| or regular performance of any kind, it broke my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| I speak on behalf of all my classmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| and choral students across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| Music keeps us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| Performing keeps us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| You have no idea how detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| these inequitable rules to our students, like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| For those of us who are seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| we will never have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| to spread the joy of our voices with our classmates again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| and that hurts the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| I pray you will take into deep consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| everything that has been laid before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| Please let us perform, let us sing and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| for our communities, our classmates, our parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| and for the joy it brings to so many of us in the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| You have an enormous responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| to ensure that all students across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| have access to a reasonable and fair education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| and the arts are no less important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Remember, the excellence for every child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| requires that students are given opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| not denied them, and this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| will have an enormous impact on so many lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| and educational experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| Micah Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7497)|
| 2:05:18| If you could state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| and you'll have five minutes to speak, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| Yes, my name is Micah Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| I live here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| I'm a parent of two children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| single parent, single father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| I come here today not to deal with the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| that are befalling our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| but I do want to say that I'm a very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| and very proud of the work that I do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| I do not want to deal with the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| that are befalling the whole world here with the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| My plight is before COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| when my son first started school here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| the food that was given to my son as we are Jews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| was unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| The pork for breakfast, the sausage, the sausage gravy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| the things that go against the dietary laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| appointed to all Jews and Leviticus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| And I'll read some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| And it's, I'll read Isaiah here, 65 and three, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| that sanctify in gardens and burneth incense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| upon altars of brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| which remain among the graves and lodged in the monuments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| which eat swine's flesh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| and the broth of abominable things in its vessels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| So these are some of the reason why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| That's my main concern is to ask or to make a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| to eliminate pork products, pork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| anything dealing with things that go against the values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| and the beliefs of the minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| that would be including the Muslims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| As we know, there's a lot of immigrants coming from Africa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| that's here in this community now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| and they're trying to grow roots into the ground here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| and bring their children up as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| without casting aside their beliefs and core values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| and their observances of abstaining from unclean meats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7652)|
| 2:07:38| And, but this has been a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| I've been waiting to get here for almost three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Here I am, praise God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| So I would ask the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| and I wish the woman that was over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| the health department here would clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| what benefits come from serving children pork for breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7674)|
| 2:08:01| You got your sausage and biscuit for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| My kids, I have to send them to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| with little money that I have from the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| that supplies me with EBT and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| to get them Lunchables on the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| where they have only peanut butter and jelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| and my son doesn't eat peanut butter and jelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| or he only gets one cheese stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| instead of getting however many he needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| to supplement the pork butt roast pulled pork sandwiches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| that are on the display for everybody to grab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| and so this is why I'm here today to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| I don't know because my son had suffered these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| what legal steps I should take to get maybe this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| to move in the direction of banning these unclean meats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| not only for me, but for the minority of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| that we should be all inclusive to and all thoughtful about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| just because we're not all evangelical Christians here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| that think that Jesus Christ came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| and destroyed the laws of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| which we know that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| There's many subjects that I have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| and talk to this board on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| If God wills me to be here, I will be here another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| to voice many, many concerns and many ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| that would include people in the celebrations at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| There's celebrations of Halloween that I don't prescribe to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| and I'm pretty sure as many Muslims don't either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| and some Christians don't either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| but it's pushed forth in the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| The Christmas, the Xmas I call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| it's not prescribed to any Jew, nor is it many Muslims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| but they have assimilated just to be likened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| because they don't wanna go against the grain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| they don't wanna be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Me, myself, I don't care, I'm a worm, I'm dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| I'm stubble on the ground, I don't have an accolade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| I don't have a title, I didn't go to no college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| I didn't get no degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| all the knowledge I have is that book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| and that's what I'm gonna teach my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| because my salvation and everlasting life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| is more precious to me than silver or gold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| or any title ship here on earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| So yeah, I wanted to voice that concern to start off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| and introduce myself, thank you for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| and I'll be back in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| and I hope somebody will pick this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| and maybe look into it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| to see if this is something that needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| and need to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| because I don't see no health benefits in pork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you very much for coming to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| Ms. Tonya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7844)|
| 2:10:58| Tonya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| So first I would like to say happy Veterans Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| to my dad and my son and all that have served our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| because without them, we wouldn't have the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| of doing some of the things that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| so I thank them for their service today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| But I also wanna come today to say congratulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| to the tenured teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| It's really difficult if you don't know by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| to get tenured in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| you have to have a four or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| or two consecutive years after five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| and in the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| it's been really challenging to when our scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| are related to the TCAP scores or any high needs test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| and our evaluations have been irrelevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| for the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| so I'm very appreciative that the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| has taken those steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| to actually help our teachers obtain tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| But I'm also here to say that we started a process today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| for collaborative conferencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| It was a special questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| or special polling started today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| It started today at seven o'clock this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| and it's gonna end next Tuesday around noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| and there are seven things that I wanted you to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| why it's important for us to come to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| because I can't tell you thank you enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| for having the last three contracts signed by you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| that you approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| that educators of Knox County approve of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| And as Ms. Owens stated last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| we have come a long way from where we started from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| where we couldn't even talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Well, I talked to Bob maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| but it was really difficult to have a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| that was healthy for this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| and it's proved some dividends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| and I can say that through the insurance piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| you just did a great thing for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| If you can remember last month or whatever that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| it's just the reprieve that teachers know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| that they don't have to pay for the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| because that collaborative conferencing team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| that worked on that, we agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| and we want to do what's best for everyone in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| When we talk about fringe benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| I can remember when I was about 25 plus years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| I know y'all still think I look like I'm 25, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| But I know 25 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| we used to get paid $25 for our sick days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| when we got ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| And now we're to the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| through collaborative conferencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| that we actually have an incentive program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| through fringe benefits to actually have $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| that we can buy up to a year of your salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| So don't think that we're gonna pay out all you out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| that think you have over 300 some days of sick days saved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| It's only up to your salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| The grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| We actually are able to have representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| anytime somebody feels like they are in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8038)|
| 2:14:03| Typically, they're not in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| but can you imagine if you were ever called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| to the principal's office or called by the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| and you think, what did I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| I mean, you start, you lose your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| So by having representation through the grievance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| this allows people to have comfortable, feel comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| have somebody else sit there that it's not against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| I mean, I can go sit with Ms. Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| and I can listen for Ms. Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| and she doesn't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| So that's the grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| Working conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| The state of Tennessee passed two and a half hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| of planned time on contract time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| And we haven't had any challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| but it actually helps us to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| and make sure we're sticking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| In regards to salaries, I don't know if you knew this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| almost in our last three contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| but we were 37th in the state overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| in regards to our salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| in which we pay our employees here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| But because of our memorandum understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| that we've had with our professional educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| we went from 37th to now we've moved up on that scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| And when you look at like districts as ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| we went from being number five to number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| and we want to be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| The only way that we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| is continue to have those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| with the educators at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| In regards to leave, we appreciate you giving us leave time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| As part of that leave is that you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| about three years ago, you added bereavement leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| We used to have to use our sick days for bereavement leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| If our grandparents passed away, a parent passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| So we don't have to do that because you made a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| to add that to a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| And last, we'd like to be able to have payroll deduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| I can't imagine having to write a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| to my insurance company, to my eye doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| and all these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| So all I can say on behalf of the educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| thank you for allowing us the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| And the process is gonna end next Tuesday, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| Thank you, we would like to thank everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| who has come out for public forum today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| and for the students that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| to speak about performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| We look forward to hearing the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| from our executive team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| I think you said by next week, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| So anyway, we appreciate everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| for coming out tonight and taking part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| Thank you, Ms. Fabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| Do we have anyone who would like to make comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| during board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| I do, but I just wanted to just share out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| with my community and Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| we've had a high number of violent crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| and a high number of our students being shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| And so our schools and our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| and our communities are dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| And so I just want to lift that up publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| to bring attention to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| because there's no reason that you have to go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| and educate and then talk to the classmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| about why your classmate has just been shot as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| And so just want to bring that to the radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| to give it public notice and let my community know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| that that is not something that we are taking lightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| and we're doing what we can to curb the amount of violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| but prayers and thoughts to definitely the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| who are affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| Thank you for bringing that to the board, Ms. Tatterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Okay, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=8256)|
