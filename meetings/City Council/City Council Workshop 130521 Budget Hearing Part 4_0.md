| 0:00:21| Okay, are we ready to resume here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=21)|
| 0:00:43| I'm going to ask that if we've got questions, let's keep these questions pertaining to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| We've kind of gotten off on some sidebar things here, and consequently, we're running way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| behind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| So ask questions, but please, this is about budget, so let's try to keep it to that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| we can honor everyone's time commitment here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| So with that, Mr. Haggard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| If you'll turn to page eight in the handout, that's where engineering's departmental budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| And their capital projects are page four of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| Probably the high points for engineering budget is the capital stuff, which varies a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| lot from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| This year, we've added $150,000 to new sidewalk construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| We have $1.2 million for processor road construction for that project that's been in the works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=97)|
| 0:01:48| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| We have $500,000 match money for our comprehensive traffic signal system upgrade that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=110)|
| 0:02:01| be able to get that rolling this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| We have $200,000 for design of the Merchant Drive at Clinton Highway intersection, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| that one was actually, unlike most intersection projects, this one was originated by request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| for making it more pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| And once, when we took a quick look at it, we realized that there would have to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| major changes, and we thought, what the heck, let's make it better for cars while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| at it, which is sort of backwards from the way we usually go with these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| We have a small amount, $60,000, for bicycle infrastructure improvement, a special sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=160)|
| 0:02:50| new sidewalk project on Pleasant Ridge, $420,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| And we're getting substantial benefits from the Public Works Project, the Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| Facilities Project, and the IS Work Order Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| We're going to see some real efficiency improvements, I expect, from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| Our overall capital budget is significantly smaller than last year by about $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| The only significant operational change that we have coming up is we are proposing a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| position as an alternative transportation engineer who will go in the transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| I mean, in the traffic engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| So I'm sure you're all aware of a whole lot of other projects going on out there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| I might remind you that we do have a blog that we keep updated on progress of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| and construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| KnoxvilleDepartmentofEngineering.blogspot.com, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| So, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Thank you, Mr. Agerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| My main question is about the Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| One is that the $1.2 million, how did we come to that number, and how assured are you or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| the city that with that amount of money that it will solve that problem that's been with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| us for so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| We came up with that because we've already done most of the design work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| We have a very good idea of what we plan to do with it and a pretty good idea of how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| The design process isn't finished, but I don't remember when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| I think it was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| There was half a million dollars that went into the budget for the design and research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| We did DICE studies to look at how the underground system is connected, and that ended up being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=293)|
| 0:05:04| enough money to do the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Can't be totally assured that it will totally solve the problem, but we can be very confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| that it's going to reduce the severity, both the duration and the frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| There is a lot of study that's gone into it as far as where the water goes, how high it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| goes, how often it goes that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| If we can get it above those statistically determined levels, then it will be wet less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=332)|
| 0:05:41| often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| I think the public, if we're going to spend this kind of money, is going to have a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| high expectation that this is what we say is going to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| We've taken a long time to get here because we wanted to be assured that it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| We have done all of the footwork, all of the background studies to be confident that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| going to get where we need to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Mr. Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Tell us, the new position, the alternate traffic engineer, the bicycle guy, or whatever you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| want to call him, is that a full-time position, or would that person be used for other engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| tasks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| In other words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| It is a full-time position in order for that person to develop, it's sort of an entry-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| engineering position, for that individual to develop as a fully rounded traffic engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=398)|
| 0:06:47| he or she will be expected to do some other tasks and get trained on a full range of engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=407)|
| 0:06:58| tasks, but the focus will be on bike, pedestrian, maybe some interactions with mass transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=418)|
| 0:07:09| as necessary, and that will be the main focus, looking for opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| Is that especially because of the number of regulations and oversight, or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| Well, it's mostly because it's just not something we focused on in the past, and traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| engineering in the last 50 or 60 years has been so focused on getting cars around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=446)|
| 0:07:35| we haven't designed in many options for anything but cars, and if we start looking for opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=455)|
| 0:07:44| to squeeze some other modes in there, if we don't start looking for them, then we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| not going to have those opportunities available, and having somebody who is really focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| on that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Someone's going to fly-spec the plans and help you make them better by getting that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| A big opportunity that we're missing right now is somebody just going over the resurfacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| plans and looking for places where we got room to fit in a bike lane, or look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| signalization, that sort of thing that would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Some of that stuff doesn't cost anything, and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| If you plan ahead, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| If we plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Any other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Mr. Hagman, if the budget is approved and implemented, as far as process of road, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| kind of time frame are you looking at in terms of actually completing that if it's started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| My recollection is that the project will actually take six months, and we're planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| to start in the spring, probably, I'm guessing, March, so, I mean, working in some place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| floods routinely, you kind of want to wait until the time of the year where floods always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| happen is over, so it'll probably be next spring, and then it'll take about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Hopefully, within, either within the next fiscal year, or not much into the next fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Mr. Hagman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Next up is the Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=562)|
| 0:09:32| The Fire Department is on pages 14 and 15 in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=572)|
| 0:10:02| Is it really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I thought this next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| I thought it was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| It must be contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| There's also some capital projects on page 13 of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Chief Sharp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| All yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor Padless, and thank you, members of the Council, for this chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=611)|
| 0:10:22| talk about the Fire Department and also our budget request for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| As all of you are aware, we have a very good core of dedicated, well-trained firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=632)|
| 0:10:40| who do a lot of things for this city, provide a lot of the emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| The most obvious one is fire suppression, but we do a whole lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| We also provide technical rescue, and we have a technical rescue team, which responds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| everything from building collapse, trench collapse, to just vehicle extrication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| We also provide hazardous materials response, both for the city and also for our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| We do fire code inspections, and that's through the Fire Prevention Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| We also investigate fires through our Arson Investigation Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| We provide fire safety education to our local schools and just really any place that requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| And one of our major tasks is that we also have a first responder program, which responds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| to all emergency medical service calls or EMS calls, we call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| We answer approximately 22,000 calls for service each year, and about 60% of those calls are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| for EMS response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| As far as our budget, this next year, our proposed budget is $36.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| This is an increase of approximately $1 million, or 2.95% over our current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| Salaries and benefits account for 69% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| The remaining 31% is for all other expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| We currently have an authorized staff of 327 firefighters, and we are down seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| We have 320 actually on staff right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| I'd like to take just a minute to talk about our capital requests and concentrate on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| virtually, or really all of them, but focus on their technology improvements for the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| The first one is really the second half of a capital project started last year, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| our fire station alerting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| We're requesting $180,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Last year, we were granted $200,000, and this will allow us to fully implement a fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| alerting system, a new fire station alerting system at all the fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Again, I talked about this last year, but I'll just briefly remind you what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| This is what our 911 center uses to notify our firefighters at the fire station that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| they're about to receive a run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| It's basically a system of speakers and lights that come on and give the firefighters information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| about their run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Our current system was first installed in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| It was upgraded in 2002, and it's seen its useful life, so it's time to get it replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=805)|
| 0:13:35| Our second request is what we refer to as a CAD system upgrade, and it's for $359,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=815)|
| 0:13:45| What this is, the 911 center currently has purchased a new computer-aided dispatch or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| CAD system, and they have started working on that as far as the cabling and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| that goes with the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| This new system will make several improvements over the current dispatch system, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| having all of the agencies on the same computer system, so we'll actually finally have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| ambulance service and the fire department on the same computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| We'll be able to see the same information that the ambulance service has on their computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| It's also going to have improved mapping capabilities, and we'll be able to see hydrant locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| on those maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| We'll be able to see electronic pre-fire plans shot to us from the CAD system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| So what we're requesting on this is for us to be able to purchase the hardware and software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| that we need to put on the fire department apparatus to take advantage of that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| There will be automatic location devices on the fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| There'll be basically MDTs or computers on the fire trucks, which will provide the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| our pre-fire plans, all the dispatch information on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| We've worked closely with IS over the last year to come up with our plans for that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| they've provided a lot of the technical expertise that we need to come up with what exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| we need for this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| And our last request is basically a firehouse web upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| And what that is, firehouse is the incident reporting software that we use to compile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| all of our data on our runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| We have to report to the Tennessee Fire Incident Reporting System all the information on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| runs, the type of runs, the number of runs, our response times, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| And this is the software that we use to be able to electronically store all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| It is time for an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| The system that we have was initially started approximately 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| IS is on board with this, and it's going to make things easier for them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| We'll basically be going to a web-based information system, and it's going to help them be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| to manage it a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And I think that's where I'll stop and take your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| You said, Chief, that you had, what was it, 327 authorized, but you only had 320 on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| Are you going to train the new ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Or are you just staffing at the current level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| What's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| We will train new ones, but it's not cost-effective to train just seven at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| We normally don't even consider it until we're down about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Fifteen is about the minimal size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| What's your turnover on an annual basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We lose two or three per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| We do have some retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| We have two or three that just move on to other jobs per year, and then we also have some retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| We have some retiring at the end of this year, so we would probably look at beginning the process sometime next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| But at seven, that's just not cost-effective to have ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| What's the per head cost for training one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| It depends greatly on the size of the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I assume it's 15 to 20 or some optimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| We've estimated like $50,000 to $60,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| and that doesn't really include like the overhead for the training center, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| That's really just their salaries and the direct costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Chief Roush, I see you in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| I apologize for being a little tardy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| Police department starts on page 11 on the handout, and they also have some capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| I'll try to find that and tell you what page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1102)|
| 0:18:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Capital for police department starts on page 11 and goes through page 12 and on to page 13 on the capital handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1119)|
| 0:18:52| Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| Well, we are here to present the proposal for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| Of course, the police department is responsible for the safety of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and we have authorized to us 416 sworn officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Currently, we have 401 of those positions full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| We have 114 authorized civilian positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| 112 of those are filled at this time, and then 32 crossing guards, and those are all filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| Total authorized strength is 562 in terms of both sworn and non-sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| Our operating budget is $50,527,510.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| It's a little over a million-dollar increase from last year, and most of that accounts because of personnel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1184)|
| 0:19:53| Obviously, we are the largest department in the city because we provide the everyday security service for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1193)|
| 0:20:04| We're about 35 percent of the city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| In the budget, our request in terms of – I'm sorry, let me give you a couple of things on numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| Last year, we answered over 335,000 calls for police services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| That was up about almost 4 percent from 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| We filed over 37,700 crime reports, and basically breaking that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| 5,170 persons' crimes, 15,212 property crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| We made over 15,000 arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Those were arrests that we initiated, plus took into custody another 7,000 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1243)|
| 0:20:53| Crashes, we worked 7,376 property crashes and 1,876 injury crashes with 24 fatals last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1253)|
| 0:21:04| Those are the numbers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| To talk about our capital budget requests, we have police facility improvements at 400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1266)|
| 0:21:18| OCU vehicles, that's our organized crime unit, those vehicles are undercover cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| We purchase those every year, obviously, to keep those vehicles from being recognized by those who we are investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1283)|
| 0:21:32| The training academy multi-purpose building, that request is because we have been advised by the Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| where we're currently located at the Moses Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| They are attempting to sell that building, and so we have a need to build a new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| And it was actually a phase three that we had already in our plans out at our training facility off of Cement Plant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| IAPRO data integration, and that is to integrate our internal affairs computer information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1318)|
| 0:22:08| E-citation printers, that request is as we move in technology, as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| we will have in our police vehicles printers to be able to print out citations that will be written electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| instead of the paper sites that we currently use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| And so the officers will have a tablet, they'll write the information in the tablet, it will print from the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Online reporting, that is to open up a reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Currently, that's not something we provide as a service to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| but this will allow the community to be able to go online and make a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| and then that report will be reviewed by a supervisor instead of the person having to call in to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| We've done reports where there's property taken or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| that there's no evidence for an officer to come out and collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| Safety City, the gate needs to be upgraded for security at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| And then the last in the capital is our target upgrades at our firearms facility out at Cement Plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1388)|
| 0:23:18| I did want to mention, I did, of course, have my senior staff here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| and I do want to recognize the newest member of that staff, Deputy Chief Monty Halp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| who took over the Criminal Investigation Division on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| And so he has joined us as well as the rest of our staff, who you all are very familiar with, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1413)|
| 0:23:42| Open it up to any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Chief, I guess we all read the paper a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and there were talk of 40 new officers or whatever and $4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and what is that about and where is that in the scheme of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| I heard you speak about the Berkeley study that talked about staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| based on some survey they had done around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Could you just give us a little background on where that is in terms of this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| or any other budget we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Yeah, and what we've done is obviously we've made a request for additional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| And as all of us are given the responsibility in our departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| we're supposed to be looking at what the future needs for this city are and for each of our departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| And I thought it was important that we point out that we do have a need that does exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| and should eventually be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| So obviously the mayor and I have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| and I realize that it was an aggressive ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| and I understand that with the funds that come in that we're limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| But I wanted to make sure we put it on the radar that we do have a need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| as we go forward in policing our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| to look at that possibility of increasing our staffing so that as crime changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| as trends change, as we try to adapt to address those things, that we consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| I did find the UC study, the University of California Berkeley study, an interesting study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| It talked about the most, as they called it, under-policed cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| and we were ranked 27 in the under-policed cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| And they talked about a lot of different factors, including economic factors, crime factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| There were a lot of things they looked at in that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| So, of course, we looked at that, and we look at other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| So obviously we expressed our need as we look into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| and I think it's an ongoing conversation that the mayor has agreed to have with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| In terms of technology and special training, we have, at least the special training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| we have some good news on that front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| How does that make up in part for sheer numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| In other words, how does that balance out the wish list versus the skill list kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| We're very fortunate in that our officers are very well trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and we continue to be able to provide them training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| And that does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| And technology, obviously, is a force multiplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| And as we get more technology, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| there are things that we can do with that technology that we can look at numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| And, you know, one of them is this request to do online reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| That's going to assist us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| And so we constantly look for the different ways that we can economically do the job that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| More efficiency, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Further questions of the chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| I guess I should have asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| We have a training session this year or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| We have another block of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Yeah, we will, as you approve, we will be able to fill our vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| Right now we're at about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| We anticipate we'll be at about 25 is our anticipation with retirements and normal attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| And that academy wouldn't start, as we're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| it wouldn't start until January of next year because of the process that it takes to do hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| No other thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| We're to other agencies, beginning with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| MPC is shown on page 16 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1676)|
| 0:28:09| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Move down here where I'm comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| You're out of position, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Mike Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you, Vice Mayor Favelis and Council, for the opportunity to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| For the fifth year in a row, we have requested the same amount from the city at $905,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1706)|
| 0:28:35| Those five years follow the high point in our funding from the city in 2009, which was $913,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1715)|
| 0:28:48| We have a total operating budget of about 3.4 million 36 full-time employees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1728)|
| 0:28:59| We have two key positions that are vacant that we need to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| We needed to fill them a year ago when the county cut our funding further and were unable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1746)|
| 0:29:15| The county has increased their funding to us this year so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| adding another $100,000 back to what they had reduced it over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| Our hopes are to fill a position in addressing and a position in our GIS staff to get back to where we really need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1767)|
| 0:29:38| We are down to a single person in addressing that has experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| With our last ice storm of the season, she broke her leg and literally was out of the office for two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| and things were piling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| We all pitched in and helped as well as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| but we really need to fill an addressing position to provide her for backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| If the budget holds as it's been submitted, we will be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| One of our biggest efforts this year will be the completion of our five-county regional planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| by the end of the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| When we have our weekly staff meetings for that Plan East Tennessee project, half of our staff is in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| So on any one day, we may have 10 to 15 of our staff people doing something related to that regional planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1830)|
| 0:30:39| with several of us kind of adding a second full-time job for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| We're excited about how it's been going so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| and excited about completing the project on time and on budget by the end of the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| That is probably the most significant chunk of our budget other than the city's contribution this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1858)|
| 0:31:08| It is grant-funded and will be going away come January of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| When we compare our annual operating costs to the contributions that we get from the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| the fees that we collect, and the reimbursements that we normally get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| through our regional transportation planning projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| there will likely be a $300,000 to $400,000 gap next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| We will be forced out into the grants market in order to keep the budget balanced again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| It is time to think about moving off of the $905,000 number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1906)|
| 0:31:54| and pressuring the county to get back to where they were four or five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| when they contributed a comparable number in terms of cash and in-kind services to close that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1920)|
| 0:32:15| This coming year, we will be completing East City sector plan update and Central City sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1935)|
| 0:32:26| You will be seeing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| We hope to be having completion of the sign code task force work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| and get that in front of you in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| Last month, the MPC recommended approval of enabling legislation for the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| to create corridor overlay zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| If that's implemented, we expect to complete design guidelines for a couple of corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1971)|
| 0:33:00| The most likely would be Washington Pike and Asheville Highway have come to the fore so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| We've also looked at the possibility of doing that sort of thing along Clinton Highway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1987)|
| 0:33:16| Those may come up over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| We have in the pipeline a new residential zone district that we have drafted for the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| that we would like to bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| In doing so, it could replace what we call the infill housing overlay zone district with a new base district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2011)|
| 0:33:41| One of the barriers to its implementation had always been that city permits and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| did not review residential house plans because the new zone district has some design standards built into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| that need review during the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Now that they're doing residential design review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| that removes one of those barriers to implementing that new zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| Questions of Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Councilman DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Part of your funding traditionally has been fees that you get for review of plans and proposals and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2062)|
| 0:34:30| Is that picking up at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Do you see any growth in that area as you try to make up the slack when you run out of grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Where do you see the money coming from other than asking for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| The activity that we see is very definitely picking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| We had three residential concept plans on our agenda last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| They were the first new residential subdivisions that we'd seen in about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And our fees for this fiscal year are running about 10% ahead of what we had budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| So we are seeing a very definite uptick in development-related activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| We're budgeting about $408,000 in fees for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Is that kind of a break-even or is there a net to the pot, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| It's nowhere near break-even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Our target is to cover about half of the cost of the development services review through the fee with the policy that the review really is for the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2127)|
| 0:35:55| And the community as a whole should pay their fair share for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| And as I recall, you also had some contract work you were doing for some other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Is that still ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| We do a little bit of contract work within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| For a period of time, we were doing some work for school districts outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| That's been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| And we have a couple of very small maintenance contracts with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| So that's not going to be a major source of revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Any further questions, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Knoxville Zoo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| The zoo is scheduled at the top of page 17 and then also the last page of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2200)|
| 0:36:55| So the operating portion is up $50,000 from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Thank God, more to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| Yeah, we need a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Boy, it's warm, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Ooh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Okay, animal tabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| I got a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I'm Lisa New, the Executive Director of Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| And I'd like to thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis and members of capital, for letting me be here today to talk about how the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| Knoxville's investment in Knoxville Zoo allows us to remain a valued resource in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| I've given you a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I heard you say more stuff to read, but there's not a whole lot of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| A lot of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Ooh, we like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| And we'll go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I did tab our recent openings and planned openings toward the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| Knoxville Zoo serves the City of Knoxville in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| By attracting tourists to impact Knoxville's economy and by ensuring we remain a treasured community resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| We bring tourists to Knoxville in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| I'm sorry, we bring tourists to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| And we do that because we're a top 20 attraction in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| We're the City of Knoxville's anchor tourist attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| We're the city's most visited year-round attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| And we're a key economic driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| In 2012, we welcomed over 400,000 guests through our gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| 36% of those were Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| And 57% or 228,000 people were tourists visiting Knoxville from greater than 50 miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| That translates into $23 million of local economic impact for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| And that number comes from the Tennessee Department of Tourism Development that values tourist spending at $100 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| That's 423 local jobs that are supported by Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| 160 of those are Knoxville Zoo's annual full-time equivalents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| And 263 additional local jobs are supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| Our goal is to drive tourism traffic to Knoxville by giving guests what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| partnering with Visit Knoxville, and advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| In 2012, we spent $317,000 on advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| 49% of that went to tourism marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Through visitor guides, rack cards, billboards, and online advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| we reach millions of potential tourists and visitors every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| A recent nationwide study showed that seeing animals, experiencing something educational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| new exhibits, having fun, and being together were among the top ten priorities for families choosing a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| Knoxville Zoo is able to provide all of those by giving interactive experiences, getting close to animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| having something new to see, and in a pleasant and beautiful environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| Knoxville Zoo enhances guest experience by creating increasingly dynamic animal habitats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| and constantly improving amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Outdated facilities are coming down, and new gold standard experiences are replacing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| The city of Knoxville's support ensures that the zoo remains highly competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| as a major tourist draw and economic driver for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| If you'll look at those tabs, I've highlighted our planned and recent openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| And I'll go quickly through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| In 2012, we opened Clayton Safari Splash, which is a public-private partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| with the city of Knoxville and the Clayton family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| It has one-of-a-kind interactive spouting giraffes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| It's 5,000 square feet, and it's a wet, wild way to enjoy the hot summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| This year, we've added new restrooms and changing cabanas to that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Last year, we also opened the Valley of the Kings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| another public-private partnership with the city of Knoxville and the Ann and John Schad family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| This is a $2.1 million habitat, and it features animal demonstration stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| that we will promote further this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| So a door will drop down, revealing a platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| The keeper is able to work the animals through impressive behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| and show our guests up close what it takes to take care of these fascinating animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| In 2013, in March, we opened Lego Play Lodge in Clayton Family Kids' Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| It's an indoor play experience and a year-round venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| In 2013, we've also, in March, opened Budgie Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| which is a walk-through aviary with hundreds of parakeets and a feeding opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| In July, we will open the Williams Family Giraffe Encounter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| which will allow guests to be eye-to-eye with giraffe and also have the opportunity to feed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| So our capital plans after this year will truly make Knoxville even more competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| It will increase our tourism potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| and we're grateful for the city's investment of $10 million to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| As with all of our improvements over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| these projects use the city of Knoxville's investment to leverage private support and contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Public-private partnerships are what continue to make our zoo successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| So the next three projects after this year, the first will be Tiger Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| and that's Knoxville Zoo's largest capital project since Clayton Family Kids' Cove opened in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| and it will be the zoo's most sustainable to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| It will transform one of the zoo's oldest areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| the caging back there has already come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| into while immersing visitors in a Malayan rainforest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| it will have multiple opportunities for play, education, and interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| and it will greatly elevate guest experience and extend their length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Following that, another key experience in the zoo's future is further enhancements to Clayton Family Kids' Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| including replacing substandard housing for our animal ambassadors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| those that we take into schools and out to community events and that greet guests on the pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| A new amphitheater, play and education spaces, as well as permanent bathrooms and event space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| And then the grandest project in zoo's history will be the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Center, or the ARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| This will be the zoo's first totally indoor year-round venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| It will feature gallery-style atmosphere and showcase the ninth largest reptile collection in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| We're currently only a tenth are on display in facilities built over 40 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| The ARC will feature guest viewing into laboratories where significant conservation work is truly saving some of the world's most endangered animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2628)|
| 0:43:57| The ARC will be on a lead track and will allow people to experience the zoo in all kinds of weather, day or night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| and will be a beautiful work of art in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I've also included in your handouts the many ways that the Knoxville Zoo gives back to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| and how we strive to remain a treasured community resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| I won't go through all of those for the sake of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| but suffice to say that being a valued community neighbor and resource is a critical part of our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| and we strive to do that through our membership program, our school field trips and outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| and partnerships with other area nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| So to finish, I'd just say that our aggressive tourism marketing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| paired with new animals, interactive experiences, up-close opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| and our beautiful grounds continually improving amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| all of these will help ensure the zoo remains highly competitive as a major tourist draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| and economic driver for the city, as well as a treasure for the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| So that's my handout, and I'll be happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Thank you, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| That was very interesting, and the information is very useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Tell us, because this capital budget plan, the $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| is a big chunk of at least proposed, what, bond financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| what's the total cost of those three projects, the Tiger Forest, the Kids' Cove upgrade, and the ARC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| In other words, how much are we putting in, and how much is the total project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| The city's contribution would be nearly half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| And how would you get the rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| That would be through fundraising and private contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Okay, and is there any way of estimating sort of the return on that investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| In other words, can you project more visits or just being competitive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| I mean, how do you look at that as a revenue generator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Well, we do anticipate that each of these new habitats will elevate guest experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| They'll make people stay longer, and then obviously when they stay longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| we'll spend more while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| But also it's able to help people stop off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| We are a key attraction right on I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and 228,000 guests come to the zoo from places outside 50 miles now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| So being able to increase the value of the zoo and those experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| will increase the number of attendants that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| And it also will prevent our facilities from just continuing to wear down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| and getting less competitive and below the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| What time frame do you foresee building these over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| Well, we've already begun demolition for Tiger Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| That has about a two-and-a-half-year timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Just across from the Lions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| It's all gone now, green space, as we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| And then we anticipate that the project timeline will begin this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| and can run around five years, five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| The completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| So the tigers will be wherever they are now for the next five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| No, the tiger facility itself would start this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| It has a two-and-a-half-year timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| But for all three of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Oh, I see, all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Dr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I'm a little bit confused on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| So we're asking for $10 million now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| and then how long will it take you to spend that $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Well, that $10 million would be allocated over the course of the next ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| and we would use that to leverage our private dollars in building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| So it would start now, and Tiger Forest, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| all of those projects are scheduled for completion at around the five- to seven-year timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| So at that point we would be finished with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| And how critical is it that you get $10 million right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| And then make that passionate point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| Well, having the $10 million, like I mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| that would be allocated every year over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| And that is just a more fiscally responsible way for us to fund these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| instead of with loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And that will also then allow us to have the spending in place, make the changes quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| get the designs in process, and be able to complete that timeline as we project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| Otherwise, the money wouldn't necessarily be in hand to meet that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| I think there's a little confusion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Jim, if you would address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| When we talk about doing a $10 million bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| and we're still looking at lots of ways to finance it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| we are probably not going to go to the market and borrow $31.4 million all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| because we recognize that there is an extensive period of time to fund these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| What we're asking for is authorization here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| In terms of the actual financing that takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| and, again, we're looking at several ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| One of them is what we call a capital outlay note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| And I use that term because that's the legal definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| We commonly refer to that as a line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| And one of those things would be sort of like a construction loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| where we enter into a line of credit with some bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| and draw down on that line of credit as we need those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| And that's a way to save interest costs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| We may do what we call a resolution of intent where we can internally finance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| and then we repay ourselves back with bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| But, again, as we get closer and tie down some of those schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| that's when we'll come back with a specific financing mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| But, again, we're looking at, you know, the $31.4 million in debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| but the interim financing is still yet to be determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| and that's a long way off, and there's lots of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| So don't expect that on July 1st we're going to come here with a $31.4 million bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| because that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| You'll do that as you draw or need the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Well, again, we're looking at the best way to finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Typically, you know, if we do a capital outlay note or a line of credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| and, again, if you were going out and building a new house, think of it the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| You go to a bank and let's say you're building a $300,000 house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| you are probably not going to borrow $300,000 on day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| because interest will start accruing from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| But you'll get the authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| But you'll have the authorization to borrow up to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| You'll probably enter into some sort of line of credit agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| and draw down that as payments come due, and that's where you can minimize the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| Once you draw, you pay interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| You only start paying interest from the day you draw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| So, you know, if it's three months into the thing before you make the first draw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| you don't pay any interest, you know, for the first three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| And, again, the specific way we structure it is still yet to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| But, again, when we talk about this 31.4, you know, that's kind of like the authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| and we'll come back to you with a specific financing mechanism on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| How do you lock in low interest rates if you don't sell the bonds right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Well, again, what we – and, again, there are a variety of ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| We talked about a line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| We talked about internal financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| We may go to a bank that basically will make a commitment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| when we need the full 31.4 million, we'll basically have that agreement in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| but not draw on it for a set period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Now, again, we're going to have to evaluate all those structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| to see which is the most financially advantageous for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| But, in essence, you've got a five-year capital plan worth $31 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| that you're trying to get authorized and then you take pieces and you actually implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| We're going to take pieces of it, and there's some legal reasons why we're doing this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| And, again, something that only finance people care about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| but since these are tax-exempt bonds, we have to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| we are subject to what we call arbitrage restriction, meaning that we can't arbitrage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| Now, if I could get positive arbitrage, you ought to give me a huge raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| because in this environment, nobody can get positive arbitrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| But the computation that you have to go through to compute this for IRS purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| is very extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And so we want to make sure that we can time these expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| so we don't have anything that we even have to report for arbitrage purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| So it could be several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| I mean, it could be several years before we fully engage at 31.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| but we may draw down 2, 3 million immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| A lot of this is going to – I think you're looking at probably a good year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| to year-and-a-half construction on the public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| Lakeshore, we don't have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| They don't need that on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| No, we are not going to – again, on July 1st, we are not going to have a $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| But by July 1st, do you have to declare what all the projects are going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| Well, what you're doing as part of the passing of this budget is you're expressing your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| We may end up shuffling some of the stuff around to make sure, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| we're all in compliance for legal purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| But you're talking about intending to, at some point in the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| to issue $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| For the projects that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I'm sorry, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| I think part of what you're asking is that we're going to approve these three different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And so two years from now, you're not going to transfer that money to some other project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| It's going to go to those three projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| As we put together this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| and we'll probably have a very broad bond caption that says public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| and we'll kind of shy away from identifying specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| And there are reasons why we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| Again, to give us some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| So if we need to shift some funds around, then we'll have the ability to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| You don't want to get too specific when you do one of these bond deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| But you'll have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Yes, all bond deals have to come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| There's what we call an initial resolution period, where we'll come up with an initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| There's actually a time for what we call no process period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| And we have to wait that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| And I believe that's 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| in which case people have a right to petition to contest that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| But there's a lot of mechanical steps just in borrowing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| I mean, you know, it's just like you go down to your bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| You can't walk in and get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| There's lots of steps, and all of those have to come back and be approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| These are all general obligation bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| We're talking general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Sorry for the confusion, but I think there's a lot of things going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| We're going to hit that on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So what they're asking for is for a commitment for $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| not necessarily paid out in one lump sum of $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| So it will actually be paid out over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| They're asking the commitment for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| But it's going to take us several years to actually get the full 31 or what you've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| How does that help the zoo leverage private giving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| How does having the commitment help you leverage it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Because it shows that the city's invested in the Knoxville Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| and then it allows us to say in our fundraising efforts that we have half of this project funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| So it's giving to a program that already has municipal support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| Does any draw have to have a matching private dollar to go out the door, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| Well, again, I don't think that's the intent of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| but it depends on how we structure an agreement if we have an agreement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| But that was not the intent that we have to have a dollar-for-dollar match or some sort of, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| I'm sure that they're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| That's the hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Well, I'm sure that the zoo is not going to go out and start building these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| without making sure they have funding in place either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| I recognize Tim Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Tim Williams, who's the zoo board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Just a comment on that, Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| We have, for the tiger exhibit, we have a million dollars in private funding arranged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| and so we broke ground on that exhibit with that arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| The alternative to the city funding would have been debt at a much higher cost of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| than the bond issue is going to result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Because we have a municipal bond rating that gets the buyer of the bond some tax-free pennies, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| Some yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| So when we talk about the other two major projects, when we talk about the ARCC project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| we don't know for certain the size of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| It will largely depend on the amount of private dollars we can attract for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| We don't have a commitment on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| We've not gone out to the community to ask for that commitment yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| but we'll be doing that as we get closer to the time we want to start drafting plans for that exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| But do you feel that helps you leverage the private dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| It absolutely does, and it gives us some sense of the scale that we can build to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| Without having the city's commitment, it would be very difficult to build the exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| of the quality that we need to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| We've got a tremendous amount of species to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| What are they called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Snakes and lizards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| It's really a great exhibit, and we just don't have a way to show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| And so raising the money, getting part of it from the city, part of it from the community is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| All right, any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| The AC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| The AC is included on page 18 in the amount of $615,640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3553)|
| 0:59:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavley and council members, for this time to talk to you briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| about the Community Action Committee and the work that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| and the important partnership that we have with you to help us accomplish these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3579)|
| 0:59:48| Our annual budget is about $32 million, and we have 375 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3588)|
| 0:59:57| During the course of the year, we will serve about 11,500 unduplicated families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| and provide services to almost 35,000 different individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| I gave you a little selection of some of the outcomes that we have for our various programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3611)|
| 1:00:19| whether they're Head Start, transportation, meals for seniors, connecting people with jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| One of the updated things, I could tell you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| we had a very successful free income tax preparation this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| And as you see, in the previous year we had $904,000 in returns to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| This year it was over $2 million, $1 million in earned income tax credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| and another $1 million in returns that people were able to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| and have to help them spend in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| but also to help them do the things that they need to do for themselves and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| And, of course, we have two main purposes that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| the funds that we receive from the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| One is we use it to help us mobilize financial resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| If you look at our pie chart there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| you'll see that our primary responsibility is to fund what we do by grants from federal and state sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| And so about 70% to 73% of our budget comes from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| And the part that we're really particularly proud of is that little blue slice there which says 17.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3698)|
| 1:01:48| And that is local contributions that are from foundations, from the United Way, from Sunday school classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| but it's not in-kind contribution, it's cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| And in this report period it added up to $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| which is a significant investment on the part of the private sector to the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3725)|
| 1:02:15| We also do a lot of mobilizing human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| Almost every program that CAC operates has a volunteer component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| And you see the value there of the volunteer time that was marshaled in this particular report period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| with over 434,000 hours documented and a value of more than $3 million of that contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3752)|
| 1:02:42| And in addition to that, we receive all kinds of in-kind donations of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| and things that we're able to use for another $2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| So between the federal and state dollars that we bring into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| and the human resources that we're able to mobilize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| that is really what we use the city funds to match and to help us accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| Now, the biggest new investment that we did last year was to invest $125,000 in the CAC Case Management Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3791)|
| 1:03:21| And I'll give you a little update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| The program continues to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| If you look at some of the numbers at the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| the program's now been operating in the second report period for 44 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| We still have no evictions to the streets of people who are enrolled in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| And we have 230 residents who remain stably housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| We have some very interesting figures that are coming out of the folks that were exited during the period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| and we'll be preparing some additional information to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| But I don't think this is the time to get into that this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| But I know if you look at the budget amount there, it looks like it's a decrease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| but actually it's my understanding that the $125,000 for the Case Management Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| has been moved to the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| and that there actually is an additional $50,000 that we requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| to go towards salary increase for CAC employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| So if you have any questions about that or about anything that we do at CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| I'll be happy to try to answer it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| I know you must be awfully tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Well, of course, we appreciate what you guys do, and you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| I think what you just said was to that $615,000 we would add the $125,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| or get to $740,000 to cover the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| But in terms of budgetary management, part of that's going under a different group, the community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| And I know your guys haven't had a raise in a long time, and so it's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| That's true as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| So we do appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Dale Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Let me, before Dale Smith comes up, let me talk about things that PBA does for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| because it actually shows up in multiple places in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| and you won't be able to find something that says PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| And I'll give you some page numbers if you want to refer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| One of them is what we call Waterfront, Second Creek, the cinema,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| which is actually the plaza outside the cinema, the one that's across the street from State Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3974)|
| 1:06:22| That's actually found, the budget for that's actually found on page 30 in your budget presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| PBA manages the World's Fair Park for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| That's actually on page 91 in your budget material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| They manage the various parking facilities, including State Street, Main, Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| Jackson, and some other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| That's page 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| And, of course, the city county building, and that's actually found on page 112 of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4010)|
| 1:06:59| In addition to that, there are several other things that they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| One is a little tiny item, but that's they manage some of the security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| I'm going to call them security badges if you use your badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| The police department has the same kind of arrangement for their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| and PBA kind of manages that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| They also do facility management at the Transit Center and at Magnolia, the Magnolia Cat Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4040)|
| 1:07:29| the Crutcher Facility, I think is what that's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| And, as you well know, we occasionally bring various things up through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| and that's for project management on a variety of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| So, again, PBA flows throughout this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| and we use them kind of as a facility manager, project manager of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| So I'll address any specific questions you might have, but, again, perhaps Dale's better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Good afternoon, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| First, I wanted to introduce the two folks to my right, to my far right, Robin Smith, no relation, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| is our finance director, and to my immediate right, Jeff Gallion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| who is our property development manager as well as our telecommunications system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| The only thing Jim left off was that we do manage the cities, the counties, and the school boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| the school districts' telephone systems, the hard line systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| I'll also make an offer for any of you that are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Just call me, e-mail me, or ask Jim to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| And that is we put together a budget, and then Jim carves it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| and spreads it throughout the city's budget appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| But in one sheet that's sitting in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| you can see everything we do for the city in fairly simple, straightforward terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| I happen to have a copy that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I don't, but I could e-mail you one tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| To summarize our budget, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| Could you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| I mean, we would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I think that would be a great thing for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| I'll send you this sheet that shows the consolidated, and there's layers of detail below that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| and I'll be glad to send any of that if you have any questions about any portion of that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| It's easier to get your arms around it than to see it in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| I wouldn't want to have to find it in your budget or the county's, and that's why I made that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| Mr. Smith, sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| If you were to send it to Ms. Mitchell and then she can distribute it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| I sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Our budget proposal this year is right at $200,000 increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4187)|
| 1:09:58| and that's against a $4.2 million total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| A little over half of that is that we recommended mirroring the county's 2% wage increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| We generally mirror the cheaper of the city or the county's wage increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| and almost always the cheaper is the county's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| So we have a 2% salary increase built in, and that represents, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| a little over half of that $200,000 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| A couple of things that I wanted to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| First, I wanted to sincerely compliment Mr. Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| It's been a pleasure for us to get to know Eddie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| and Eddie's consumer business background causes him to be very focused on, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4241)|
| 1:10:51| in his terms, the customer experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| And I mean that is where we're concerned in relationship to experience within the parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| experiences at World's Fair Park, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| And Eddie has been great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| I'm sorry to see him leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| And we've benefited greatly from him working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| and challenging us to make those experiences better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Having said that, I will tell you that we are painfully aware of some problems in the parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4278)|
| 1:11:26| particularly kind of being a victim of our own collective success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| with the amount of people coming downtown on nights and on weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| when the garages are not manned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| We have some flaws in our computer systems, in our technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| that we are very aggressively trying to shop and fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| In fact, my property management director, Jane Bird, is at a national parking conference, as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| doing exactly that, looking at the kinds of technologies that will be both cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| but will also improve the customer experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| An example of something that Councilman Saunders and I were talking about yesterday is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| our current systems only count vehicles if we have the gates down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| Well, putting the gates down on nights and weekends is kind of counterintuitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| and counterproductive for easy flows of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| It slows everything down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| But what that also means is that you can drive into a garage that's full without knowing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| until you get to the top, which is really annoying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| And we know that there are technologies to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| In fact, we've been in discussions that are not conclusive about extending some of those matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4363)|
| 1:12:51| to your own street parking potentially, and that's an area that no decisions have been ultimately made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4371)|
| 1:13:00| But there is logic in managing all of your parking assets, both your own street and your garage assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| and making sure that, for instance, people that are trying to park downtown all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| we should try to migrate them into the garages where we can accommodate all-day parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| and let our on-street parking be more available for those people that are transients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| that are coming in to have lunch, that are coming in to shop for an hour or two and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| And so we're putting a lot of effort into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it because you haven't seen many changes yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| But I think you will see those over the next three to six months, some significant improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| in how the garages certainly function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| And depending on the city's decision, potential improvements on the on-street side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| I'm going to stop with that and just take questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| Well, Councilman Del Voco, he has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you. It's unusual, but I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| I can picture where you have, like, the old rubber hose counter or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| or a weighted thing in the floor, and there's a display as you enter saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| 10 spaces left or it lights up, try the Smith Street Garage or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| In other words, it tells you not to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| I don't know if that technology is around, but it would be helpful if you were just coming in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| nah, go someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Well, the simple counters are fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| But when you've got multiple entrances and exits and such, it does get more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| And to be honest, I'm thinking a little maybe beyond that in that there are already cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| that the commercial private sector have apps where you can get on your phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| and it will tell you not only where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Most of the apps right now that even have Knoxville on them will tell you where the garage is, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| It doesn't tell you if it's full or empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| It doesn't tell you what it costs, whereas in larger metro areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| there are already free available apps that will not only tell you where parking is actually available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4512)|
| 1:15:20| it will tell you exactly what it will cost you per hour or per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| And so my goal, frankly, is to get us all the way until 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| not stuck back in the early 90s with the technology we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| And it will take a while to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Obviously, there's some expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| But there are already a number of cities that have sensors on their parking meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| or on the pavement for every on-street lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| You can pull an app up that will show you exactly what parking spots are available on Union Avenue like right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| And so I would like to see us, on your behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| migrate to that kind of system where people stop talking about there's no parking in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| because there almost always is, but you have to know the town to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| The second question or last question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| is there any way you could squeeze into your budget some kind of a shade that covers those skylights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| when we have a midday meeting and someone tries to project on the screen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| all you see is white reflection and no visibility from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| And I don't know how you do that, but, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Grandma would have lowered the shades or something, but maybe that's something you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| Actually, I've asked my folks to look at tinting, some type of tinting that we could put on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| because you probably won't remember, but if you looked straight up behind you three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| you would have seen that cheesy corrugated fiberglass that was being used for exactly that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| And when we re-lit the room, we got rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| But for daytime meetings, it is a little bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| That kind of blinds out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| And the county commission has the same issue because they typically meet in the afternoon, not night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| When was the last time a comprehensive parking study of downtown was conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| Including all the garages and parking on the street and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Has that been done recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| It's my understanding that there's one in process, but I would defer to Jim or Eddie on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4641)|
| 1:17:31| We did ask MTAS to do a parking study for us, and we just finished the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| They presented it to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Well, they have not been presented to the mayor yet, but they have presented it to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| and they will present it to the mayor probably within the next couple of weeks, so we will have that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| That's garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| It's not garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| I think it's primarily on-street parking, metered and free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Dale, do you have in the budget monies for inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| or does somebody look at the stairwells like in the Market Square garage as far as the upkeep of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| Because I park there quite often, and it looks a little shoddy from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| and we have visitors from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| How often is that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Is there money in the budget to keep those stairwells looking a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| Well, it's not necessarily a money issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| and it's something that I guess the best response, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| is that currently the cleanliness of the garages is the responsibility of our contractor, Republic Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4723)|
| 1:18:52| We are very, very seriously looking at bringing that in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4732)|
| 1:19:00| and having it be our responsibility and allocating more resources to exactly that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4740)|
| 1:19:08| because we're paying a company a substantial amount of funds to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| as well as man the booths and take care of the equipment to some degree and do other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| That is an area that I am not happy with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| and it's frankly one of the primary reasons that we're looking at making that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| And what we tried a year or two ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| was we tried separating the toll booth attendance and the parking piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| and separately bid the custodial piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| but the numbers came back so prohibitively high that we simply couldn't afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| We think by bringing it in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| we'll be able to work in a way that we can get the numbers where they make sense in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| All, frankly, not just the stairwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| The common areas in general are beneath the standards that I'm interested in meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Anything else for Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Mr. Nance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| I assume we've saved the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| I wouldn't even give a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| He's just giving me the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| I'll make you a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| I saw Judge Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Well, listen, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Counsel, I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| What page are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| I stand before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Oh, I'm not certain what page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| As far as I know, it's the capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| The allocation, what we're going to call to KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| this is I think the fifth year of a $100 million commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| That's the $80,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| $800,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| I think it's the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| It is $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| It is actually part of community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| If you look at it, it's in the capital budget, and that's the only thing we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| It's below 14 in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| As Jim said, our request is part of the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| We're here to request a continuing support of the capital request that KCDC made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| As Jim said, we're into our fifth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| We started out as a project to address the Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Teller and the Five Points community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| We are moving forward with that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| We have built to date 105 new units that have been occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| We're currently in the process of building 17 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| Some of those have been occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| We had a ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday to acknowledge the street naming for former Commissioner Juanita Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| You can see some of the construction on the six plexes that have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| We are also in the process of, through some funding that KCDC had available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| we are now looking to select a master planner to come in and assist us with master planning the site where Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| Teller sits at today to break that down into phases for us so we can begin to identify our funding need as we move forward into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4944)|
| 1:22:32| We anticipate maybe going before our board in June to get that approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| so that's another step in the process of moving the Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Teller project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| Right now we're operating off a continuing resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| so I can't give you a lot of answers on what the future funding looks like for capital with this side of the HUD budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| because right now there is a budget approved by Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| We just don't know what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| We are preparing, though, for next year to put in a tax credit application to the THDA, to the State Housing Finance Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4978)|
| 1:23:07| That round will appear in February of 2014, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| So we will apply at that time for another round of building in the five-force community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| We would utilize some of that money that is being asked for this year to be as part of that budget piece for the next round of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=4997)|
| 1:23:27| Question to Mr. Nance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| He does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| Here comes the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Standing in the public assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5026)|
| 1:23:55| That was Laugh-In, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| Here comes the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Laugh-In?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Was it Laugh-In?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Some of us are old enough, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| No, I saw those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Laugh-In.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| It's good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I want to thank this Honorable City Council for having us over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| This is Valerie Coleman, for those who may not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| She's the Municipal Court Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| And we also brought Ann Bateman, who is number two in command over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| And we thank you for letting us come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| And we submitted our budget, and we hope it meets with your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| And we ask you to consider it and approve it if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| And we'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| Melissa, which magic page am I on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| I was reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| How much money comes from the red lights, cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Less and less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| She can probably give you a figure, but I can tell you it's way, way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| Is that because they're no longer turning on red?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| No, they're not turning on red anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| I was told some number of months ago it knocked about 70% of it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| And it was a little over a million dollars a year, I think, at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| It was two, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| It was roughly 1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Now I think we're talking something more on the order of less than 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| That much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Worse than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| So most people were turning right on red, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Well, again, it's a combination of a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| One is the right turn on red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| And then we expect at some drop-off as people get used to the lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| because that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| You want to do some, I guess, operant conditioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| or whatever you want to call it, behavior modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| so that people aren't running those red lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| So we did expect a drop-off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| And then the right turn on red has probably had a more significant impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| So the budget's on page 21 in the middle of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| And according to this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| there's a 3.2 excess fees collected that's transferred to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| which is $291,000 more than last year, which is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5173)|
| 1:26:23| If I can say something about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| we would like to thank the information systems for helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| I think one of the things we did to help raise that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| was suspend more driver's licenses electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| They came up with a formula that was doing it a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| for people that were not paying or not showing up in cohorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I really appreciate the information systems, Janet, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| That's a big help for the general operating fund to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| It's about $0.08 on the current tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| And that along with the we now have online payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| so people can go online and make their payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| and not have to actually come to the building to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| So that's a big plus as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| So you're talking about what you implemented last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| to go after folks who hadn't paid their court costs and the fines and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Got their attention by taking their license away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| That was always going on to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| It's just going on more efficiently now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Do we still have an issue with people who have had their license suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| but continue to have a need to drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| The new set, you probably saw it, it's been a year or two ago now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| I think they reported that 24% of all Tennesseans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| I don't know what the percentage is for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| but 24% of all Tennesseans are driving without license and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| And that's a significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Any other questions of Joe Drossen or his staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you very much for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Let's go ahead and break to be here at the 5 o'clock public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| Yeah, I just wanted to say I wanted to thank Melissa again for the outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| It's made, I know for the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| it's made it so much simpler to not only understand the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| but also where to find everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Melissa, I guess on behalf of all of us, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=5311)|

| 1:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| My concern is in the capital improvements for the bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| for the $31 million capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| And my question is whether that's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| and whether that's the right projects to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| And I'm not saying it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| but I just think we need to think about some other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| And I've talked a little bit about parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| and those are an economic developer for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| We've proven that with Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| You're spending a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| You're getting ready to spend a lot of money in Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| Parking is a problem down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| You're getting ready to add a whole bunch of new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| more new to the market residential units in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| and it's going to continue to put pressure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| So I would propose that we postpone the vote on the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| and give us some time to meet with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| and talk about what opportunities are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| and make sure that if $31 is enough or if it's the right $31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| and give us some time to, you know, really kind of delve into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| So the rest of the budget is pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Not too much whistles and bells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| But this is a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| You don't do bond issues, but the last one you did was eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| And for the mayor and for many of us sitting on council, this is your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| And I would question whether those are the right ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| I think we need to vet that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| These are the right projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| And these are the projects you're going to be your time on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| And for her, this is what you're going to be known for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| It's what these improvements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| And in public service, that may be the best thing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| But I think that's going to go down as your project in the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| Is that the place you want to spend $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| It sounds like to me that you almost made cash flow that deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| I mean, they're only going to need it for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| I mean, so some of those things you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| I don't know how much leeway we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| And, Gene, I don't know whether you can substitute things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| There seems to be a lot around the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| But these are your big projects for our term and for our mayor's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| And I think we want to make sure that those are the right projects long term for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| I think the other thing is about the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| I mean, there's money being flowed into the Coliseum in a building that is way outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| You know, it needs a lot of money spent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| And Chill Highway Park is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| And we don't do bond issues very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| I think we need to make sure we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Before I comment on what George just said, I want to thank Cindy and Melissa for the incredible job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| and kind of keeping track of us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| This has made the day a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| George, I understand what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| And I do think that amount of borrowing certainly needs to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| I would ask Rob, though, to opine on kind of what we can do relative to this budget that's been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6486)|
| 1:48:14| I know going forward we can have a lot of input and will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| And I suspect we have had to this particular process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Council doesn't have line item say-so in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| You can make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| I'm sure, you know, particularly if there are five or more of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| recommendations would be strongly listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| I mean, I'm not speaking for the administration, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| But you might want, you know, if people have concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| you might want to individually take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| I don't know if you can speak with the mayor or Jim or Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| And, you know, maybe some issues can be addressed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| But we can't go through and say, you know, out of fund whatever, I want to increase this or decrease that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| But, you know, maybe something cooperatively can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| I think, given George's scenario, that you could amend, you know, you could add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| or take away from the bond issuance, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Yeah, I think capital, you know, you could suggest that not doing specific projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| and having a different capital total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| We have authority to do departmental total and to give that back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| And you could make the amendment that you take if you wanted to take all five of those projects out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| and not do the bond issue this year and just leave capital the same other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| I think bonds are voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| And I'll say, too, I mean, I think we know we have to approve a budget before July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| So, I mean, if we were going to go down that path and so what would happen that the, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6594)|
| 1:50:02| the previous budget would go in place if we didn't have a budget in place by the July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6602)|
| 1:50:08| Is there a distinction between the annual budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Okay, my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| The annual budget, which is the one that Rob was talking to about line item changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| and the capital budget, which is more or less sort of a part of a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| I'm not sure what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| I mean, obviously, we do things in year one, two, three, and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| But it seems to me that that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| That you could amend that document and take that segment of the projects out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| and not pass the part that's related to the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| You could make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| I mean, you could pass a part that's smaller than 31 million, without the 31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| Yeah, adjust it how you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| But now they wouldn't have to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| But you're basically giving them the authorization to go to the bond market, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| is what he was saying, that you're just authorizing that to occur in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| But if you took those five things off the plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| then the capital would stand as it is without those five items and the related bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6665)|
| 1:51:15| I thought George's question was broader, and that is, he was looking at future planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6675)|
| 1:51:23| where's the best place to put our bucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| Can you get a better return on investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| This stuff's all going to happen somewhat slowly over time, but it's determining our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| I thought that was the thrust of where you were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Let's talk about the philosophy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| It's how I was reading you without looking at the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| I mean, do you want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| I mean, is it a bond issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| I mean, is it enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| And what projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| And the timing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Anyway, it's wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| Of course, Jim was saying he's not running to the bond market tomorrow anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| and he would bring a bond issue to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| He's looking to see if he's got the categories and what they are and the amounts kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6729)|
| 1:52:17| But that's somewhat fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| Maybe Jim could tell us a little bit more about that and that capital budget aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| Because it seems to me like the annual operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| we're trying to pay our employees to do the job that we all need them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| and most of those costs are predetermined by the numbers of people we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| I mean, they're running the system with the costs that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6756)|
| 1:52:43| Jim, can you enlighten us a little bit more about this capital side of the story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| and the funding of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| I'm going to try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| The budget as presented includes a capital, what we call a capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| It's a one-year budget allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| And so if you were to pass this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| we are basically allocating $10 million to the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| $5.2 million to Lakeshore Park, so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| In terms of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| we have recommended that we go to the bond market to fund five separate projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6809)|
| 1:53:38| And again, as I indicated, we will not be coming forward on July 1st with a proposed bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| We want to take a look at all our options and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| I think it was indicated today that we're looking at multiyear funding on the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6828)|
| 1:53:56| We will probably be looking at next spring before we do Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6836)|
| 1:54:05| Likewise, we're going to get, I'm not an engineer, but I'm guessing it's going to be kind of an 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6845)|
| 1:54:12| and Council Member Grieve may actually have a better idea on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| but you're probably looking at 12 to 18 months on the public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| And then Lakeshore, I just don't have a good feel on that one because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| how quickly we can get underway because we may be able to move that one along fairly quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| once we get possession of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| Now, but in terms of cash flow, you're not going to have $31.4 million in cash flow over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6880)|
| 1:54:51| I mean, that's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| So we want to time that so we can minimize our interest, our borrowing cost and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| And as I indicated, any, I'll tell you up front, if I bring a bond proposal to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6899)|
| 1:55:06| it's going to be fairly broadly written so that we have some flexibility in terms of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| And it will probably say that we may do this project and this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| and various other public improvements because, again, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| I personally like to have very broad authority in case so it gives us some flexibility to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| if we run a foul of funding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| So, for example, let's say that we thought we could do the public works complex over the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6934)|
| 1:55:41| You know, that's a fairly sizable piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| We could come to the market and borrow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| Well, let's say all of a sudden we, you know, we start doing it and we run a foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| We hit something, you know, bad soil or something like that in delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| You know, well, if the bond resolution is written broadly enough, that gives us some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| Okay, well, we do have this one ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| We can fund that with bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| And then what we were, say we're going to fund project X with other funds, we'll just shift those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| And that's one of the things that you want to do as part of this bond issuance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| Again, I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| I'm not sure if I'm answering Council Member Dillon's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| No, I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| You're just helping us understand what we're, in essence, authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| and what you see as the logical horizon as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| But, again, if you adopt the budget as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| and we are recommending that you adopt the budget as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| you're committing to $31.2 million in projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| The specific funding arrangement, we've talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| We've identified bond proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| But, you know, that money may shift around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| So, for example, as long as it's not earmarked, for example, gas tax money, we can only, it's restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7016)|
| 1:57:03| But some of the other funds, we can, okay, it's like taking it out of one pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| and move it to the other pocket, and we will, you know, maintain that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| You could go to the market more than once, too, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| We can stagger this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| That may be part of the strategy we'll look at, and we'll stagger part this year and part next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| But, again, we're trying to present a package of improvements that we think are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7042)|
| 1:57:32| And, again, I'll be working with administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| and we'll try and come up with a good financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| And let's hear from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| I'd like to address what Councilman Wallace raised, and maybe to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| In preparing this budget, these capital items we look at as all things we are already committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| and already doing, and any of the opportunity costs that may be out there, let's say a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| and we don't have a garage project or a garage located at this point that we would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| that's why when there are other potential uses of capital dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| But the decision to go to the market is a financing decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| We are, over years, bought the land for public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| spent money, appropriated money for the planning and the design of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| Once in with that, once pregnant with that, you know, once you get going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| you're either talking about building part of it and stopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| and then waiting for another year and building part of it, or waiting and holding your fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| Otherwise, I think Jim was saying, alternatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| by waiting until you appropriate year after year enough money in getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| It seemed as a financing method, given the interest and giving everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| that made a lot more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Same with Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| This was something that came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| We're obligated under contract to knock down these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| We have to do that in getting these from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| The zoo, I think as you heard, we were already spending X amount of money a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| this certainty that this money will be forthcoming allows them to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| and allows them to go to the markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Not to get into all the substantive arguments about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| but I think there was one principle that I want to underscore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| that none of these are new projects that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| and administration has picked out to go and go to the market for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| They are financing for projects already underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| And I think that's an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| And once you start looking into other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| you're really getting into new projects, which I think is philosophically a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| I would also point out, and this has to do with the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| and trust me, I may be a year off on this arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| We have a five-year management agreement with Knoxville Zoological Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| And as part of that, we have made a commitment for $5 million worth of capital funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7186)|
| 1:59:54| And I think this is year two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| So, last year we committed $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| You basically are committed to $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Now, that's $4.5 million, again, spread over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| I will admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| And what the zoo has requested is kind of to not only commit to that $4.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| but basically operate under the assumption that a second contract four years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| would have a similar kind of arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| And that's what we're doing is we're just kind of making a commitment at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| that we'll fund up to $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| And it enables them to go out to donors and try and solicit other funds to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7233)|
| 2:00:40| That's an extension of what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| Well, again, the $4.5 million, you're committed to the $4.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| because we have a contract that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| Four and a half over five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7250)|
