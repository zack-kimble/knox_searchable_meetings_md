| 0:04:32| So it's 11H is being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=275)|

| 0:05:39| We'll move on to item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| My report to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Good to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| I just wanted to start this evening with something that has been on so many of our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| I have a new trick I learned from some teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Raise your hand if you, anyone you know or in your household or close to you started school virtually or in person sometime in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=354)|
| 0:06:05| Or sometimes that's our last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Yep, we have a lot of people in this community, including our own children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| Who started back or and friends who teach and work and at UT and at Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| So, including my own family members teaching and going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| So, just wanted to congratulate everybody for the decisions that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| I know that there have been some tough decisions made by the school system, but also for individual parents on whether to go virtual or in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| So, I have great respect for everybody walking the path that's the right and best path for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| And I encourage everybody to be gracious and patient as we work together to try to keep our schools open and keep everyone as safe and healthy as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=406)|
| 0:06:57| So, the trick I learned, it wasn't really a trick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| It's just when you're teaching virtually, doing lots of stuff by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| It helps every once in a while to ask people to raise their hands or something to, you know, encourage engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| I'm sure our professional teachers will be really good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| But every little tip helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| It helps our council meetings too, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Anyhow, so to make virtual learning an option for everyone, I'm really grateful that the school system moved forward to invest in Chromebooks for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| Every single Knox County student has a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And while the right device is critical, so is access to the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| And unfortunately, there are close to 7,000 Knox County schools families with school-age children who do not have access to high-quality Internet at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=456)|
| 0:07:46| So that's why I, along with all of you, am pleased to support the Knox Education Foundation's eKnox initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| And we have pledged $100,000 to help ensure that every student can get online this year and have full access to virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=473)|
| 0:08:02| So even as eKnox is filling an immediate gap, the initiative will also help our community gather data that can inform longer-term efforts to secure high-quality Internet for all families, such as the public broadband feasibility assessment currently led by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=482)|
| 0:08:17| Council members, thank you for your enthusiastic pledge of support for this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| I'll be coming back to you with a budget amendment in the coming weeks to formalize the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And thank you to the Knox Education Foundation as well as the chamber and our partners at Knox County who have also pledged their support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| Supporting eKnox is one way my administration is helping link families to technology and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| Looking ahead, tonight's agenda includes more than $130,000 for local partners who support education and workforce development for young people as well as adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=520)|
| 0:08:51| Workforce development is a big part of my administration's efforts to promote thriving businesses and good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| By connecting residents with opportunities to learn a trade and connect with careers, we not only support the employment needs of our local businesses, we also create pathways for families to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=538)|
| 0:09:08| And one important opportunity that the city is pleased to support, and it's already available in our community, is the TCAT Fast Path initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=548)|
| 0:09:17| Earlier today, the city of Knoxville hosted an information session about new Fast Path training programs offered by the Tennessee College of Applied Technology, which most of us know as TCAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=557)|
| 0:09:29| Fast Path puts students on a path toward pre-tuition for industry-certified training programs designed to help students unlock new careers in healthcare, which we obviously need lots of people in that field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=569)|
| 0:09:41| but also important fields such as plumbing, pipe fitting, welding, industrial electricity, and HVAC installation and repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=581)|
| 0:09:51| These programs are tailored to meet the needs of those in our community who may be experiencing unemployment or underemployment due to shifts in the service economy on account of COVID or who are ready to transition into a career in those skilled trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=591)|
| 0:10:04| So even while this is not an easy time for our economy, I know you'll help me in spreading the word about ways families can receive help right now to build a better future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=604)|
| 0:10:13| So speaking of COVID-19, I do want to take a quick moment to address the latest numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Today, I'm pleased to report that we are seeing a glimmer of hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Today's active case count is actually lower than two weeks ago at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| Today we have 2,160 active cases, and two weeks ago we had 2,261.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| So I would love, as I know we all would love to see those numbers be much, much lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| Health experts are saying that the mask mandate is working, and we are putting the brakes on what had been a rapidly escalating situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=639)|
| 0:10:47| So big thanks for the continued effort that everyone is making in the name of public health, and keep practicing those five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| Finally, I just wanted to announce and invite all council members to join me this Thursday at 10 a.m. for an official opening celebration at the Baker Creek Bike Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=655)|
| 0:11:05| This is yet another milestone as we seek to grow and enhance the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| It's a one-of-a-kind facility popular with bikers of all ages and skill levels, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| I gave the bike park pump track a try the other day, and I'm here to tell the tale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| So it's something for everybody, and I enjoyed doing it, and hopefully you and other people you know will give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| The track has been complete for some time, but we are pleased to finally be able to come together safely to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| Just to give you an idea of how popular the spot is becoming, this past Saturday, volunteers with Appalachian Mountain Bike Club counted more than 800 laps on the tracks at Baker Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=697)|
| 0:11:47| So hopefully the weather will cooperate, and I will see you all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Of course, please, if you come, remember to wear your mask and practice physical distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| And that is all for my report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=717)|

| 0:36:15| happy to, um. Council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| writer. Look into what the what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| the change was, and I can share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| that with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you. Council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Singh. Thank you, Mayor. Um I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| just when I first heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| this. I felt very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| uncomfortable, which is why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| went out to meet Mr Bridges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Mr Lovin just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| That it was something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| won't be changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| neighborhood or disturbing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| neighborhood. It's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| within the cemetery. Um. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| much as I can. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| it's going to affect. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| residential area. I was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| concerned about that. Um. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I just wanted to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| I do think it's a good idea to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| get the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| involved because I'm sure if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| had that feeling. A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| people may and then Mr Levin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Are you still on the call? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| am. Yes. And I'm hoping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Mr Bridges will still try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| um. Get the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| involved. They're all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| behind it. We had talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| that when I was out there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| I'm hoping something happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| there. Yes and they have, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| many years of expertise and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| they're, um they're willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| to, um, advise and guide, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| And I think it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| to get the community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Good. It's very beautiful and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| needs to be taken care of, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| it is and we we've been looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| at this for quite some time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| and going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| regulations and making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| that everything is exactly by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| the book like it's supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| be. We wanted to be. Um the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| minimum distance from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| bridge. Um, the minimum distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| and, um. So the structure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| going to be very tasteful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Everything that the bridges do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| on their their. Their sites, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| are very nice, very well done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| and they have an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| reputation throughout their, um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Their expertise and they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| a very good place. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| it's going to be a top notch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| facility, and that's the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| The community will be proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| it. Thank you, Mr Levin. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| you, Miss Singh. Thank you, Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Lovin. Any other questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| comments? Seeing none. Oh, go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| ahead. Yeah I do have one. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I do have one more and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| one. I'm going to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| move on to the next item. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| I'm going to move on because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| know we have two items, uh, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| the agenda related to this. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| the event that we go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| we approve both of these. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| and I'm not saying that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| community is not going to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| favor or embrace it. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| it's just a matter that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| need to know. I'd have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| myself if it were in proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| to my community, and I had not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| heard from the community. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| don't know if they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| felt that way, but I'm definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| involved to, uh, make me feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| more assured about the purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and, um, exactly where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| going to be located. So in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| event that we were to pass both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| of these, um. Would we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Let's say in the event that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| there were some some major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| concerns in the community would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| be able to, uh, make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| about whether to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| with the legislation or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| change something if we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| and pass both of these today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Well, uh, Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| uh, passing these today would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| put this plan project further on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| down the road hearing, um. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| know, well, having been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| this, um. Four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| ago. Um uh, you know, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| an issue back then about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| community input. Uh I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| think if council wanted to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| an opportunity for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| input, it might be better to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| have it sooner versus later. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| don't know how to do that. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| I don't know how to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| something together. Uh but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| you go ahead and approve, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| the rezoning Council has more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| discretion. And approving or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| disapproving a rezoning. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| might be better to, um. Think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Okay, I would have to probably defer to Councilmember Singh for additional guidance since she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2488)|
| 0:41:41| actually been on site and maybe get, ask for your, I guess your thought process on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2501)|
| 0:41:50| Councilmember Singh, knowing that the community has not had an opportunity to have any input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| or conversations, and I just happened to be out there and was asked that, those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| and I did not have specific answers at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| And again, I can absolutely understand the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| This is a new concept for that community and probably for a lot of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| I know it would be, if it were to be put in my community as well, I'd have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| So I'm going to defer to Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| As I said, I felt very uncomfortable when I first saw it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| So I do understand that feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| I also, I've gone out there, but I know the community hasn't been involved, but in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| going out there, I feel comfortable that they are being respectful to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| and won't be a disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| But I would like a commitment, Mr. Levin, what can you do to plan ahead to have a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2577)|
| 0:43:06| meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| What kind of plans can we make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| I think we can plan to meet with the community within the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| That's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| And we still have the special use that we've applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| And so that's the ultimate at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| I mean, rezoning doesn't really, I mean, it's general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| There's no difference in putting an office in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| But we really want to meet with the community and alleviate any questions that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2618)|
| 0:43:48| has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| And because the technology that goes into these facilities now, I believe, would ease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2629)|
| 0:43:57| anybody's mind on the questions that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| When is the special use vote coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| I'm sorry, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| When will that be coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| In a couple of weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Yeah, September 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| And if we, if Council voted no on that, they wouldn't be able to go move on with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Vice Mayor, do you feel comfortable, I would organize with you and Mr. Levin to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| speak to community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| I feel comfortable going on to the next step if there's an issue to vote no the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| or the next reason we get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| And special use that date was September 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| That really doesn't, that doesn't allow for a lot of time to pull a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| And then that's also, we've got a holiday there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I mean, you'd have to move expeditiously to be able to have a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| And I would be happy to eat and meet with individuals one on one if they want, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Isn't that the next council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| Question mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Yes, I just had a question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| What opportunity is there for public input that the use on review the special use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| review level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Well, Mr. Thomas, I mean, there would be the opportunity for public input at the at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| special use level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| When you come in, you look at criteria for determining more about what's the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| does it meet the requirements of giving a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| And that becomes a little bit, a little more formal than a simple rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| So I mean, I note that if the special use is coming on September 10th, and there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| meeting that is also planned between now and then, that, you know, there is the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| if Council desired and, you know, Councilmember seeing who represents the district that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| items could all be taken up at that one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2794)|
| 0:46:44| I think I hearing all the discussion, I would probably defer a lot to what Councilperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| Singh thinks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| She's been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| She's talked to the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| It's her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| It's a close call for me, but I would probably defer to Councilperson Singh's thoughts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Thank you, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| It's right across the street from your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| So I am concerned about the community not feeling that this was pushed upon them because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| it is sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| So I'm wondering if we can postpone this vote for two weeks, and then we'll still have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2841)|
| 0:47:30| special use in two more weeks after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| So it's really giving us a month to get things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| That sounds reasonable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Mr. Levin thinks that he can pull the community together a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| I think it would be prudent for us maybe to just push the pause button just for a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| and give the community a chance to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| There may not be as much resistance, or there could be a lot, but I can feel a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| uncomfortable going forward without us knowing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| So I would second such a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| I don't know if Mayor Kincaid can see me wave, but I'm going to jump in here briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| Thanks to Councilmember Roberto and Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| I do not have a calendar in front of me, and they pointed out that September 10th is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Thursday, which I greatly appreciate, so that sounds more like a planning meeting and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| a city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| So I apologize for inadvertently throwing out a wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2914)|
| 0:48:46| So Mayor, I would also support Councilwoman Singh's postponement, seconded by Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| But I think that we already have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| I'm not certain how we need to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Well, you can withdraw your first motion, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| The motion to postpone has higher rank, so you would hear it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| If it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| I'd like to make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Okay, motion by Councilmember Singh to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| But I think Councilmember Thomas needs further discussion to postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=2986)|

| 0:50:05| Okay, motion to postpone passes 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| That is the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Okay, we'll move on to the next item, which is related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3009)|
| 0:50:22| 9-N is an ordinance approving the request of Wade Lovin for Alliance Funeral Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3022)|

| 0:50:43| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200825?start=3043)|
