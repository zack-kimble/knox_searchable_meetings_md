| 0:15:10| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I have a lengthy list of questions, but I'm not going to go through all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| because I think the more I look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| the more it comes back to what really bothers me most about the timeliness of this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| is that this charter administration, who is supposed to be a partner working with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=934)|
| 0:15:45| knowing full well that it was well past the deadline for our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| and being advised that it was well past the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| wanted to push forward and give it to us after our agenda had even been published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| I think that shows just an amount of disrespect for the chartering authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| that we shouldn't allow to go on because we are expected to have some kind of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=973)|
| 0:16:28| And if we continue to just let them do whatever they want to, especially this early in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=988)|
| 0:16:40| I think it sets us up for a very bad relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| I think we need to stick to our deadline, and we need to not approve this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1004)|
| 0:16:54| I'm not going to vote for this tonight because I don't feel that it was timely filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I would just like to ask Ms. Nixon, I know she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Just ask her a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| I know on Monday you said that as far as oversight goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| there's not really a whole lot you can do until this agreement is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Did I understand you correctly when you said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Well, and that is my understanding because I am working on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| The board is the chartering authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| And since I am working on behalf of you all, until an agreement is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I don't feel like I can have the same kind of oversight and authority to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| But they are still continuing with their processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| So they will continue on regardless of whether we have given you the official okay or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| Because we have approved their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| they have the opportunity to continue on with enrollment, recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| They have jobs posted for teachers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I had the same clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| So thank you, Ms. Nixon, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| And I want to thank Ms. Nixon and Gary Dupler and everyone who worked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| all the hard work that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| I do still have a problem or concern about the timeliness in which we received this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| and have an opportunity fully to vet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| But I do want to thank them for their work because I know work went into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and the time frame that they had was limited, but they did the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| So I want to thank them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| First, I want to thank Steve for recommending an app| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| that made me able to completely go through this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| because otherwise that wouldn't have been possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| He read it to me while I was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And I echo Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Thank you, Ms. Nixon and Gary, for all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| It does seem like this is a very legalese procedural by the law and stuff like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| but I also echo the concerns of Reverend Butler and Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| I would have loved to have had this on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| I do think it sets a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| and I hope that that's something that Ms. Nixon and the people involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| can really keep an eye on as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Ms. Cooney, will you do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Ms. Owens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Dr. Butler, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| Ms. Byke, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| That's four yes, one no, and two pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| So that doesn't make quorum motion fail since quorum was not made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Do they need to bring it back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Mr. Triplett, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| So the question is, you know, do we need to have a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| And the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| So the board is going to have to have a contract with the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| So something, either this or if the board desires, you know, some tweaks or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| that it will need to be brought back in December for the board to vote on the contract of some type with the chartering school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1251)|
| 0:21:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you, Mr. Deepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Mr. Triplett, I think we have some public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you, Madam Chair, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Tiffany Matthews is our first speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| Hi, Tiffany.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| If you'll state your name and county of residence and then you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Tiffany Matthews, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I would like to address comments made by Mr. Myers in the Knox News Q&A regarding his response to the culture of resistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1293)|
| 0:21:42| identified by the Special Education Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Mr. Myers described his understanding of special education within the public education system as possessing a distinct status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| one in which the disconnect between what the school district's recommendations are and what the parents' desires are can become legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1313)|
| 0:22:04| The TGS, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| This is correct, as it is a parent's right to dispute a school's decision through several avenues, one of which is to request a due process hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1326)|
| 0:22:16| However, as a parent who has gone beyond my own children's programs to advocate for drastic improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| I know with certainty that parents' desires are for KCS to simply follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| I myself was once unaware of my child's rights, in a large part because I believed what KCS was telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| I figured it was my job to be the best parent I could be and provide that expertise to the IEP team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| and it was their job to provide expertise about my child's program in accordance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| I have found over and over parents don't even know what has gone wrong with their children's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| Now that I am helping other parents in IEP meetings, they have been told the wrong thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| and they don't even know it until another parent opens their eyes, just as mine were open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| A lot of focus has been on lawsuits, generally portrayed as one-off cases by overly demanding parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| This representation is grossly incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| The KCS cases that go to due process and are settled or lost in court are the very tip of the iceberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| often representing hundreds and even thousands of students with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| whose basic rights under IDEA and ADA have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| Those rights include appropriate placement in general education classrooms with support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| receipt of related services like music therapy or specialized instruction through effectively prepared modified content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1424)|
| 0:23:53| It is time for KCS to recognize federal law is not being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and the solution to get us back on track is straightforward and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| Follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Our trust as parents will naturally follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| Thank you, Tiffany.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Up next is Kim Kredich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Kim, I think you know the routine, but if you'll state your name and county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Kim Kredich, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I wanted to follow up on what Tiffany said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| First of all, I want to say again how excited I am about the task force recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| and the school's commitment to implementing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| But I will tell you that when that new Sentinel article came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| my phone blew up with what in the world, parent desires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| It seemed to place this once again as an us versus them, parents versus the school system and special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| And I want to be very clear that when it's thought it sounded like at first it seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| did a wonderful thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| I came up to her after years of advocating in front of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| and I said, Is anything going to get done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| And she said, I'm going to be honest with you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| It just looks like there's one person complaining, and that's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| And I couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| I couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I thought, What do you think I've been doing full time for I think over 900 families at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| full time as a volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| So I called on people to e-mail and say, Hey, she helped us, and she's representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| So then luckily a bunch of board members reached out to me and said, Okay, so it's not just you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| We were told it was just you wanting having an agenda to lawsuit the district or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| Then it became, Oh, all these parents, overly demanding parents suing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| And it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| That's the tip of the tip of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| That's the very tippy top because most parents will not go to litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| They will homeschool, do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| And now with the task forces shining a light on, Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| This actually is happening, and let's solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| That felt great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| But then to see it was sort of like now it's before it was overly demanding parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| and now it's back to we just need to close a communication gap like Sped's playing it for these parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| And that feels very patronizing and somewhat insulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And I want to make sure we shine a light on the communication gap is between the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| and what Knox County Schools Sped has been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Take the parents out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| Take me out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I'm ready to go, and I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| I just want to make sure we're not going down that same path of us versus them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Just follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| There are three magic words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It's called follow the law, and that's all parents are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And I really hope that when we get those outside organization eyes on it, that's what they'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| But please make no mistake, this is not the parents fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| This is the parents trying to support this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| It always has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I hope it always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Up next is Sherry Super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Sherry, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| I'm Sherry Super from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| I'm the chair of the Moms for Liberty Knox County chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| And over the last two months, I've been communicating with the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| the assistant superintendent, Mr. Dupler, and one very supportive member of this board about the explicit books in our school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1658)|
| 0:27:50| This is from a book called Perks of Being a Wallflower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| And the boy kept working up the girl's shirt, and as much as she said no, he kept working it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| After a few minutes, she stopped protesting, and he pulled off her shirt, and she had a white bra on with lace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| I honestly don't know what to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Pretty soon, he took off her bra and started to kiss her breasts, and then he put his hand down her pants, and she started moaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| I think they were very drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| He reached to take off her pants, but she started crying really hard, so he reached for his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| He pulled his pants and underwear down to his knees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Please, Dave, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| But the boy just talked soft to her and told her how good she looked and things like that, and she grabbed his penis with his hands and started moving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| I wish I could describe this a little more nicely without using words like penis, but this is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| After a few minutes, the boy pushed the girl's head down, and she started to kiss his penis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| She was still crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Finally, she stopped crying because he put his penis in her mouth, and I don't think you can cry in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| I had to stop watching at this point because I started to feel sick, but it kept going on, and they kept doing other things, and she kept saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| There are books like this in multiple libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| It's very difficult to find what book, where it's located, and cross-reference and research to make sure that the books that we're talking about are actually this explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1746)|
| 0:29:22| We are not book banners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| We just want to have some kind of policy that can either label these books, segregate these books, have parental opt-out options, or in the event that some of these are too graphic, be removed from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1765)|
| 0:29:40| This board says that there is a review policy, and I appreciate it, but asking parents and students to do this, put them in the firing line, and a lot of them don't want to report it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1780)|
| 0:29:52| The other part of your policy also says that that is not the only procedure that you can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| It does not preclude the Board of Education and the Director of Schools from developing other policies or procedures for the removal of materials from a library collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1800)|
| 0:30:09| I just ask that this board would consider reviewing their policy and perhaps making it more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you, Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| And up next, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| And Donna, I'm going to apologize for the last name, but Trapasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Is that close enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Thank you, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And Donna, if you'll say your name, county of residence, and then you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| Donna Trapasse from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| I'd like to thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I'm here with the Moms for Liberty Knoxville chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| At this point, I'd like to specifically address certain literature in our school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| As of this afternoon, we have verified that a book titled Crank by Ellen Hopkins is carried by Bearden Middle School Library and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1850)|
| 0:31:01| The sixth, seventh, and eighth graders of Bearden Middle School have unfettered access to this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| Parents and educators in this room may not be fully aware of the sexually explicit, erotic content of this book, but the kids have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1869)|
| 0:31:18| They've heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| As this book is currently out on loan to one of the 1,277 11-, 12-, or 13-year-old students of Bearden Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1880)|
| 0:31:32| I'd like to read you an excerpt of this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| We drove back off the highway and into a grove of fresh-scented evergreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| He pulled out a bindle, which looked a bit short, and a six-pack of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| For the next 20 minutes, we snorted and drank, climbing to a very tall buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| It started with a kiss-cranked, revved pistons firing full bore, passion fire crackered in tiny bursts from thigh to belly button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1912)|
| 0:32:01| Oh, baby, I want you so bad, b-b-b-bad to the bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| We laughed, but it wasn't all right, not for long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| My shirt tore open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Wait, I've waited for weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Put up and shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Kissed segued to bites, bruises, pain rippled through my body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| Brendan, please stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| No, you promised, you damn little tease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Off came my shorts, down went his zipper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| I realized I was in serious trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I'll scream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| No one can hear but skunks and coyotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Still, as I opened my mouth, his hand slapped down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Those sublime muscles hardened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Just relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| You'll love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| My brand-new Victoria's Secrets shredded, and I felt the worst of Brendan, pause, savoring my terror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| They all love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Had he gone in a different way, I might have responded with excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| Instead, I froze as he pushed inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Oh, God, there it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| I went all right with an audible tear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Pain mushroomed into agony, and all I could do was go stiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| You weren't lying, you little bitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| I laid there sobbing as he worked and sweated over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Stroked by the monster, it took him a long time to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| Give me a line, I'll give you an encore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231109?start=1996)|
