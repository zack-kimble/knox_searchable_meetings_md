| 0:07:45| And I hadn't seen an application, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=465)|

| 0:08:29| Because that person has to be sworn also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=509)|

| 0:12:54| Have we got anybody here from Big D's Market yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| I'm not seeing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Perhaps we can start with 5A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| All right, let's proceed with Mr. Armstrong first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| If you want to stand up to the podium, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| You've already stated your name and your business address at Quick Stop, Service Mart, 8756 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=795)|

| 0:13:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| What procedures are today is that the sheriff's office will give testimony as to the facts of the offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=806)|
| 0:13:35| the allegation of the offense from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| He states what he or she believes to be the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| After that, you may either affirm it or deny it or make any statement that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Okay, let's proceed then with Brian from the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| If you could testify with regard to the Quick Stop, Service Mart at 8756 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Pulled into the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| The undercover went inside and purchased one alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| The young lady working at the cash register looked at her ID and still sold the alcoholic beverage to her anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=852)|
| 0:14:24| Okay, Mr. Armstrong, do you admit or deny those allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Yes, she said she looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| She made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| I'll turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Thank you, Mr. Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| I will look to the District 8 Commissioner for a recommendation per the Beer Board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=879)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Mr. Armstrong, I'm going to assume this employee has been through the server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I couldn't understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| I said I'm going to assume that this employee has been through the server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| And this was just a one-time mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Well, Mr. Chairman, this is the first offense, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| And we want to be consistent with what the commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| And so I'll move that we will impose a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension of the license of whichever the applicant chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=915)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| There's a motion on the floor, Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| I believe Commissioner Smith has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Yeah, I've got to have a first and a second rehearse before I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Are there questions on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Brian, with the Sheriff's Department, Mr. Armstrong has testified that his employee checked the ID but read it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| Is that the observation that was correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| I do believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| The undercover, her birthday was in, I think it was August of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| And looking at the ID, I'm guessing she just overlooked what year it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=969)|
| 0:16:18| Mr. Armstrong, there are electronic devices that you can buy that your employees can use as a backup second check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| As well as the visual, you can run IDs through this and that will give them confirmation of the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| I think they're very good purchases for people in the retail business of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=994)|
| 0:16:45| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1009)|

| 0:16:55| Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I don't know how much the machine costs to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1017)|

| 0:17:09| You've got to look at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Make sure you've got the right date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Whether or not I can afford a machine, I don't know what they cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| So I can tell you if I can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Mr. Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Are you also aware that on the driver's license there is the red strip across so the clerk didn't pay attention to the red strip then apparently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1045)|
| 0:17:35| They were changing the shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| She's a very good employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| She doesn't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Shows up every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| She checked the ID and she told me she absolutely made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| And she apologized for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| But hard to find really good employees working these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| And she's a real good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| So I stand behind her 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| And obviously the whole ID was red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Make it a little easier on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Commissioner Smith, did you have a further question or did you just have your hand still up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| I still had it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| But it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| You know, we haven't had one of these meetings in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| And I was wondering, I remember Senator Massey was working on a state law that would make the directions of the IDs different from those under age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1097)|
| 0:18:29| Do we know if that's when it does have been issued yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Director Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| But it's got to be, you've got to wait until it's renewal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Yeah, I'm not sure what's in front of the legislature, but anything's got to be at a renewal at the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| Commissioner, my 17-year-old grandson has one that is oblong, but he's only had it a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1135)|
| 0:19:10| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Seeing none, we have a first from Commissioner Beeler, second from Commissioner Hill to approve either a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension, depending on which the applicant would like to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1157)|

| 0:19:57| Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| I've got a clarification before I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Do we give the person a chance to either the $1,000 fine or a 30-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Yes, they have the choice once the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| Okay, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1213)|

| 0:20:27| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Commissioner Jay votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1232)|

| 0:20:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Commissioner Durant votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Ten-aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Mr. Armstrong, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Biggs is in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| The vote is 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Mr. Armstrong, would you like to take the fine or the 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| I thought she was already paying a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| She said she'd been paying on a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Is there another $1,000 that I have to pay, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Is there two fines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| If you could provide some clarification from the clerk's office or Director Boak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| I don't think anything's been paid at the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Is that true, Ms. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Nothing has been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| She may have been paying something if they arrested her under a separate statute for violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| We don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| She told me she was paying on a $1,000 already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| She's paying $100 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Do I have to pay $1,000, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Is there two fines on it or just the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Well, we don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| She said she went to court and they charged her $1,000 and she's been paying $100 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| Mr. Armstrong, this board determines the violation from a permit perspective, which is your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1320)|
| 0:22:11| So this is a $1,000 fine against the business that had the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| So I pay a $1,000 fine, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Is that what I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| It's not a two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| You're here only on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| If they took her to court on a misdemeanor, that's separate from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| So as far as your license is concerned, you have a choice of a suspension of 30 days, as they've set out, or you can pay the clerk $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| Chairman Jay, is that something perhaps the Sheriff's Department could clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| Brian, did you have any further clarification for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Each individual that did commit the violation of selling the alcohol to the underage person was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| They were misdemeanor cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| And as far as I know, they have already had their initial appearance, and I'm not sure what the court did from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| But each person was misdemeanor cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| So it seems that that is a separate issue from this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| This beer board only looks at determinations of the beer license holder as the responsible party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| So the clerk's office, Mr. Armstrong, will be in touch with you about the $1,000 fine or the 30-day suspension, whichever you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1401)|
| 0:23:30| I don't want 30 days getting forwarded out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| They won't be in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| The clerk's office will be in touch with you regarding the fine and how to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Director Book, if you would, please move to item number 5B, Ellistown Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| And that's Mr. Doshi, who's already put in appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1439)|

| 0:24:07| My name is Niraj Doshi, and address of the business is 8001 Millertown Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1447)|

| 0:24:26| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| She is my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| You've got your name for the record in your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Procedures here, if you've been listening, are that when there is a fact of an offense or an allegation, which there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| the officer from the sheriff's office will testify under oath what he believes to be the facts regarding the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1482)|
| 0:24:53| After that, you can either admit or deny the facts as he's stated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| And if you have any other testimony you'd like to give, you are certainly free to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| You understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Brian, could I ask you to testify exactly the facts regarding Ellistown Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Again, we pulled into the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| There was a gentleman working behind the counter that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| and he also looked at the ID when the young lady approached to purchase the alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| Sold it to her, and she walked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| When I went in, he stated the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| He looked at the ID and was thinking that she was 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Did you hear that testimony, Mr. Dolce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| Yes, I did, and I agreed the same thing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Our employee looked at the ID, but, again, miscalculated it and sold the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| So you agree with the testimony he gave, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| I turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1560)|
| 0:26:12| I believe you're muted, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you, Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| I'll look to the commissioner in the 8th District for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Well, I believe this is a second offense for Ellestown Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And, you know, I really like your store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| I mean, you guys have done a good job with your store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| and I love to come in here and visit from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and sometimes buy some things on the way to county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| But, gosh, a second offense in an awfully short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| I want to ask the law director, or maybe some of my more experienced colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| is there a particular standard that we have used for second offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Commissioner Schoenmaker, you got your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Well, I was wondering if we could have some discussion prior to making the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| We have to have a motion and a second before discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Well, I could just tell you that we did ask for –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| I did ask the clerk's office for some previous precedents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Most precedents on first offenses has been $1,000 a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| In the rare cases we've had a second one, it's been $2,500 or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| To answer the commissioner Beeler's question, the tradition has been on a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1646)|
| 0:27:35| we say they have the option of a 60-day suspension or a $2,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| This one happened over a period of about 19 months, so there can be no revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| because there has to be, in order to revoke, has to be two offenses within a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| So this was 19 months, but precedent is 60 days or $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1678)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you, Mr. Law Director and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Yeah, I mean, as much as I don't like to impose exorbitant fines at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| you know, a serious offense, selling alcohol to minors is a serious offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| And as a member of this body, I feel like we bear a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| to the constituents in our district to steward these things well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| And so, consistent with what we've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I will offer a motion that we impose a $2,500 fine or 60-day suspension as the applicant chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1723)|
| 0:28:52| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Commissioner Hill on the second, Commissioner Beeler on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I'll open it up to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| For the record, on February 25, 2019, is when this body issued the beer permit to this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1742)|
| 0:29:11| Within less than 30 days, they were back before us because they had sold beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| I couldn't get any information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| I don't know if the Sheriff's Department has it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| but if that was the owner of the business at the time that was first cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| Because now we have them coming before us again, as the law director said, in less than 19 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| they're back before us again saying, you know, on a beer violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| And, you know, there's a new state law that takes effect in January of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| which the people are supposed to be checking the IDs for sale of tobacco to underage individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1793)|
| 0:30:03| because the new age is 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| So, pursuant to our beer code, Section 4, let's see, it's Section 4, Chapter 8, Subsection G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1805)|
| 0:30:19| the Knox County Commission has the option to suspend the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| And so I'd like to make a substitute motion that we suspend this license for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| And I'd be glad if anybody's interested to read the chapter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| but it has to do with if they've acted detrimental to the public health and safety of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1834)|
| 0:30:42| So, I'd like to make that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| So, we have a substitute motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker to suspend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1847)|
| 0:30:57| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Open up for discussion on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Quick question for Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Did you confirm that it's the same ownership as 19 months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Second, this body has...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| And just so you know, I did verify this with the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| and we do have that option to do what I've just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| And I'm sure we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I'm sure that the law director and you have researched this very thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| I would like to say that as far as precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| I don't believe in my time on this body that we've ever suspended somebody's license until third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1914)|
| 0:32:03| Now, if we want to change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| this would be as good a time as any if you all wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| I wanted to point out, again, since this is the second person in a row that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| that has said that their employee looked at the ID and read it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| I looked up on Amazon these scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| They're anywhere from $50 to $1,000, depending on what you get and what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| I, again, say these are wise investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| and I know when our family ran our business, which we sold about 11 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| they were a lot more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| and we always thought of them as a great second line of defense against human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1967)|
| 0:32:58| Additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| This is my first time seeing this kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| so excuse my ignorance if I ask a dumb question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| but do we have the ability or is there any precedence that we can do a fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| and also require that they buy one of these machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| or is that not something that we're allowed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| Director Booth, do you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| I don't believe you can compel somebody to buy a piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| The authority given this board is very limited by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| and the answer to your question is no, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| It does, the section 4.8 under penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| under basically breaks it down into first offense, second offense, third offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| and then section G, which Commissioner Schoonmaker outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Well, short of being able to actually compel the owner to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I would like to strongly encourage the owner to purchase a machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| I mean, you're already looking at way more in fines than the top-end machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| so I would strongly encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| Commissioner Smith, you still had your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Did you want to chime back in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| Okay, hand is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Is there additional discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Okay, right now the substitute motion is to suspend for 60 days with no fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| From Commissioner Schoonmaker with first, Commissioner Biggs for second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| This is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Madam Clerk, please call the roll on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2108)|

| 0:41:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Some of these commissioners may have a question to ask you, so I will turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you, Mr. Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| I'll look to the commissioner in the 7th District for a motion to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Let me ask you a question about the sale of this, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| Did you say that the employee had been working there for two weeks and was selling beer without the training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| Yeah, he was, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| He just joined with our business, like, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| He was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| When he got the ticket, he was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Was he in the process of training at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Usually we, whenever we hire somebody, we give the, within a month, you know, I mean, I send them to the training, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| or they can do the online training, but at this time, he was, I mean, he didn't do it yet at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| But there is one telling story of the red mark on the driver's license, or it's in a different, the way you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| instead of a regular adult license, it's at a different angle that you would look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| Do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I don't know that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Well, I'll make a motion that we have a $1,500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| Motion for a $1,500 fine or 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| Commissioner Bussler, our precedence has been $1,000 fine or 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| Is there a reason for the increased amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| Well, the questioning was, I can lower it to $1,000, but you hire an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| and you know that they're supposed to have training, and they weren't training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| and they shouldn't be selling beer at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| And I think that that's something that we really got to take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| instead of saying, well, they didn't know any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| But they do know when they get their beer license that all employees that sell beer must be in the training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| or have the training program completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| So I was kind of taken aback with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| And maybe it's wrong, but these people that run this, they run their stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| they ought to know the law, and that was my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| You can lower it if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Well, it's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| It's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| It's your prerogative to put whatever motion you want up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| I was just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Brian, did you testify that the clerk did or did not look at any kind of identification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2648)|
| 0:44:17| On this one, I think he looked at it, but I think he still sold it to her anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Commissioner, I have one more point to make in a second, but Commissioner Hill, I want to call on you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| I just would like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I think it's disturbing that the owner, not only the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| but the owner was not even aware of the markings on a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| I'm thinking that's not being very in touch with the sale of alcoholic beverages on your premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2688)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Director Book, I just – thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Director Book, I just – under Section 4A as a responsible vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| I believe it says on first offense, civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2707)|
| 0:45:17| So I don't believe that we would have the ability to go above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| There's no proof that he's in that category of what's called responsible vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| but what you state is what we have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Commissioner Bussler, would you – I just believe that we ought to treat everybody the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and people, you know, make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Would you take $1,000 as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| After questioning him and asking him if he knew and he didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and he was supposed to have taken the training and these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| you know, selling beer to a minor is nothing to just look lightly at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| because with the second offense, it goes up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| But for the owner to be a responsible person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| shouldn't have known what a driver's license looked like for an underage person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| and they should have known that the person that's selling the beer should be training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| or have their license to sell the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| So, to me, it's – if that's what you want to do by precedent instead of by the action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2789)|
| 0:46:40| then I'm going to hear the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| It's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| I'm not changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| So, the motion on the floor is $1,500 a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Is there any additional discussion by commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| I guess I have a question for Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| Are we, in fact, free to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| And can we do – require both instead of one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| I'm just asking how much flexibility this beer board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Flexibility under state law and under your ordinance is that you can set any fine up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2833)|
| 0:47:23| You can suspend and then that fine, if you give them the option of a civil penalty of paying the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| instead of the suspension period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| But you can go up to any amount that you want up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2852)|
| 0:47:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Go ahead, Commissioner Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Is another friendly amendment appropriate at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| Yeah, I just have one clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| What's the difference between a responsible vendor and a nonresponsible vendor, Director Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| There is a training thing for what they call responsible vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| and I know of none of them that have come forth with us that have gone through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| They've gone through the server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| That's required by our statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| But it's a separate category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| It's like those that also sell wine and spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| They're under a different statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| Point of clarification, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| I'm sorry, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| So this applicant or this owner would be a nonresponsible vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| Unless there's proof that he's a responsible vendor, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| So in our rules under first offense, it actually says 30-day suspension or $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| Second offense is 60-day or $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| Third is, I'm on page, well, it doesn't have page numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| but I'm under section 4.8 of the beer board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Third offense is 90 days or $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| And then fourth is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| So I'm just trying to double check why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| making sure we're doing what we're supposed to be doing according to the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| But Commissioner Smith, I'll yield to you for a second just to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| First, Commissioner Jay, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| I believe state statutes hold precedent over our rules on the amount of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| I believe we've had that discussion before at the beer board many, many moons ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| I wanted to clarify what Commissioner Bussler's motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| Was it $1,500 fine or suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| Because from Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I kind of got the impression that it was a fine and a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| No, it was $1,500 or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| And the only reason why was is the applicant said that he didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| and he's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| So it behooves me that we're going to put him back in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| and make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| well, I want to put it back to where he learns to train the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| what responsibility it is that they have by selling the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Could the law director weigh in on the chairman's question about our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| and the amount of fines that are set in our rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| What you stated is correct, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| This board, going back, I've been on here eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| and I think that had been debated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| and it was agreed by prior law directors and prior beer boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| that state law prevailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| and state law says that it's in the discretion of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| to do a suspension or pay a fine in lieu of a suspension up to the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| but not to increase over $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| I did want to have a question after we resolve this issue of the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| on a case that we had before us earlier, but I will wait until after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| I just wanted to let you know not to dismiss the board before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| we're taking a vote on the motion to fine Big D's market and its owners $1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3110)|

| 0:53:20| Or, excuse me, would you like to have the fine or the 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| She will be in touch with you about paying that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3210)|

| 0:53:34| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Commissioner Smith, I'll turn the floor back over to you before we adjourn very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| No, I've got a 30-minute lecture here for you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| I have to delay the commission meeting in seven minutes, so your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| I just quickly wanted to go back to the first case we saw today with the quick stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| The owner had said that his employee had been fined $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Mr. Law Director, I believe in the past we've had this discussion, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| as we wanted to try to do something to punish the people who actually make the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| because owners are responsible for training people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| but they can't always make sure everybody does the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| But I think it was my understanding from back then that that was a misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| and the fine was actually $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| So are they talking about $950 in court costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| I have no idea because I haven't been in that court record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| I don't even know what her name is to even find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| So I've got to say I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| But is the fine for actually selling the beer for an employee only about $50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| I don't recall because I don't recall whether it's a Class C misdemeanor or a D or an E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I can look it up and let you know, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| If you would, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| I'm wondering if our Sheriff's deputy would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| I'm not sure what the fine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| I know the court costs and fines, they vary for different offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| so I'm not sure if it's because it was a sale to a minor or what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| I can't advise on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| So, Director Book, if you could maybe find out some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| and bring it to the next beer board so we're clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| I'll begin to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Is there any more business to come before this beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| If not, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| Motion to adjourn, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3345)|

| 0:59:18| It's Reverend Calvin Taylor Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| He's a close friend of mine, very passionate about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| He's the founder of One Knox Legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3564)|

| 1:00:06| How are you doing, Mr. Skinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| I'm doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3607)|

| 1:00:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3609)|

| 1:00:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Well, first of all, let me share my appreciation to our Commissioner of the First District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3615)|
| 1:00:26| Commissioner Dr. Daysha Lundy, for this invitation, and to the County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3626)|
| 1:00:36| to the other County Commissioners, to my fellow residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| Again, I am grateful to share in this conversation a moment of reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3643)|
| 1:00:52| and being intentional to focus on what is driving me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| and what is helping me through this season in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| As we recognize, this is the winter solstice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| and also this aligns with the great conjunction where Saturn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3668)|
| 1:01:17| and Jupiter are closer than they've ever been since 1623.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3677)|
| 1:01:27| There is a particular alignment that is not lost on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| In recognizing this opportunity to recognize this alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| I want us to really focus on what we can anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| and what we can embrace in this coming season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| It is in my faith tradition we recognize the Advent season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| This Advent season celebrates the manifestation of God with us, Emmanuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3719)|
| 1:02:11| We also celebrate within the Black community, after Christmas, Kwanzaa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| Kwanzaa expresses within our tradition, in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| the ability to be creative in creating more traditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| as we, as a Black community, seek to rediscover those traditions that have been lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3752)|
| 1:02:40| We also, in the Black community, recognize New Year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| Of course, for many, New Year's, January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| is a time where folks gather together and celebrate with libations or house parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| But within the Black church tradition, we gather on New Year's Eve, going into New Year's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3775)|
| 1:03:05| what we call Watch Night, which commemorates and celebrates the anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| of the Emancipation Proclamation going into full effect, which was January 1, 1863.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3793)|
| 1:03:23| All of this to say that for me and this time and season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| I recognize the alignment especially expressed through the legacy of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3810)|
| 1:03:42| I have the great opportunity to serve with, along with my father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Reverend Johnny William Skinner, Sr., at Mount Zion Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| where we are celebrating 160 years of this church and this institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3832)|
| 1:04:02| 1860 was the year that this church was founded, before the Emancipation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3842)|
| 1:04:11| We are grateful to celebrate those ancestors who did not wait for an invitation to be free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3851)|
| 1:04:24| but they found that it was necessary to create their own agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| and own way of establishing this institution to express their faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| This is helpful as, again, we seek to embrace the alignment coming to the Season 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| My church family, Mount Zion, demonstrates a legacy of embracing the justice mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3888)|
| 1:04:58| which is important for us to think about even in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| The legacy of those people that I even come to know to embrace the justice mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| came out of Mount Zion, such as Mr. Mark Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| who was the first Black vice mayor of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| and Ms. Sarah Moore Green, who served on the county school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| as the first Black woman to serve in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| These folks, and also I must share Ms. Lois White,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| who became the first Black national president of the Parent Teacher's Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| These persons embraced the justice mandate necessary to embrace in this season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3945)|
| 1:05:56| to really bring about the necessary shift that is needed to bring healing and wholeness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3956)|
| 1:06:07| Our legacy also speaks to those ancestors who were able to embrace who they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3967)|
| 1:06:18| and how they should move even in this nation, when even on the Emancipation Proclamation Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| they didn't even get a care package to go about and move successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| But nevertheless, this justice mandate that those trailblazers embraced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=3993)|
| 1:06:41| really speaks to how we can continue to show resiliency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| and how we can align to what God desires of us as elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| as community leaders, and as fellow residents of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4016)|
| 1:07:05| I will also say that I'm proud of Mount Zion, and even in the midst of urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4025)|
| 1:07:15| which has headlines recently through the vice mayor of the city, Gwen McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| as urban removal, Mount Zion, in the previous location, in the center of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4041)|
| 1:07:32| still lays a vacant lot, which for me represents even still now the empty promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| But yet, if we embrace the justice mandate, we know that there are promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| that can even be fulfilled in this season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| For scripture points that we are even co-facilitators in the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4075)|
| 1:08:04| to embrace this justice mandate that uplifts those who have been pushed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4084)|
| 1:08:13| to empower those who feel disempowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| And this text found in Isaiah 40 speaks to a voice calling out in the willingness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4097)|
| 1:08:28| and in the willingness to prepare the way of the Lord, Isaiah shares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| make straight in the desert a highway for our God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| The rough ground shall become level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| The rugged places a plain, and the glory of the Lord will be revealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| and all people will see it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| So this is our opportunity as elected officials, as community leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4140)|
| 1:09:09| to embrace the justice mandate that calls us to be co-facilitators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4149)|
| 1:09:16| in embracing this alignment and shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| And there are those who even now demonstrate, those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| and those organizations, if we need one or any examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| these organizations such as Sleeves for Knees and Black Coffee Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| the Alliance House, the East Tennessee Community Defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| the Women LLC in which our commissioner, Dr. Daisha Lundy, also serves with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4183)|
| 1:09:51| These are examples of those who embrace the justice mandate in this season of alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4191)|
| 1:10:00| And I pray now as you all go forth that you will continue to walk in wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4200)|
| 1:10:08| even in the midst of those issues and matters that are presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| I pray now as our elected officials that you go forth in power and in truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| I pray now that you all go forth, understanding that you all are empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| to help make straight the path as we need to become the model city for this nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4231)|
| 1:10:40| and this world are desperately looking for those leaders who understand this justice mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| and understand that Knox County can be the model county for this nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4247)|

| 1:12:16| so this meeting would recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4336)|

| 1:12:20| we'd reconvene this meeting and continue with the county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4340)|

| 1:15:23| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| I was wondering to speed things along tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4525)|
| 1:15:38| I believe our rules allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| If people who wish to speak at public forum, speak before the item is heard from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4540)|
| 1:15:48| Since a lot of these relate to the Board of Health, we could get to a lot of these items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| before we get to that particular resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| So you're suggesting that everybody that is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| for public forum related to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| I think it's item number 40 would talk closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| to when we talk about item 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Okay, well, I don't think that's anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| that we've conveyed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| And I guess I'm hesitant because we told them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| to be ready at five, not to be ready at eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| or 8.30, because the county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| will take up a better portion than we've got zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| So I just assume do it at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| Good, Chair, just throwing out a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| I appreciate what you both have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| Were we to do that, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| I'm wondering how that would fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| with the total one hour before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| I'm afraid that we might become very skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| But I support your thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| Yeah, and we haven't set an hour before, hour after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| I mean, I just set it as we would go through public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and that would take us right up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| So let me just announce the vote on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| Passes is set at 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| And thank you for the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| I think given that there's so many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| that are on and ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| I'm going to proceed as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| The first part of our agenda is the honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| And I want to thank you all for signing on to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| This is one that I appreciate everybody jumping on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| And regardless of where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Somebody's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4671)|

| 1:18:01| Okay, I think everybody on the Zoom call can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| But if people in the room of the main assembly can't hear me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| I can't do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| We have several commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| who don't have their mics on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| I hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4694)|
| 1:18:14| I mean, you were really low, but I can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Rob, do you have any issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Do you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4702)|

| 1:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4711)|

| 1:19:34| defining credible elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4774)|

| 1:22:56| for voting that honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Chris Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| our Administrator of Elections for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| with our appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| First off, on behalf of all of the nearly 1,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| that work for the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| in some form or fashion for early voting for election day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| for absentee voting, for provisional ballot counting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| for the myriad number of duties that we had to undertake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5004)|
| 1:23:31| I wanna thank Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| and Chairman Jay for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| This has been a very tough year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| And despite that, despite being in the middle of a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| despite having to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| a brand new paper-based voting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| and despite probably the most contentious election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| certainly that I've been a part of in my adult life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| we still were able to not only conduct a safe election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| but break records, and break records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| with regard to total number of voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| and early voting, far and away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| the most absentee ballots we've ever had in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| not even a close second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| And it was, you know, with all of that said, it was tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| And I think there are four things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| I just wanna touch on real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| that I think made it a successful year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Number one, we needed a plan, and we put a plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| And I am not exaggerating when I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| we spent hundreds of hours working on a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| to not only make sure that folks got voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| but that we implemented this new voting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| making sure that everybody had adequate time to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| and space to vote and room to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| but also that we did so safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| and that we kept our workers safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| which was, we wanted to keep voters safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| we wanted to keep workers safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| particularly in these pandemic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Number two, after having a plan, we needed a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| We have a fantastic team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| And on behalf of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| I wanna thank all of those people who are watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| who are members of those teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| I know there are a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| all of them obviously are constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| of one or more of y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| I wanna thank them for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| They did an amazing job under really tough circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| To be blunt, we got very lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| Just in the last week and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| I've had five cases of COVID in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| I did not have a single case from June 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| through Thanksgiving, not a single one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| We kept our distance, we kept our masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| We used the hand sanitizer the whole nine yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| to do everything we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| And then, in early voting, 14 days of early voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| and any of you who know me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| that I preach early voting for every election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| We had one day of rain out of 14 days of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| So we were blessed with good weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| And so we got a little bit lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| But the last thing I wanna touch on besides having a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| having a great team and having a little bit of luck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| is having community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| And the last part of that resolution that Ms. Ellis read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| really touched on it for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| because I think a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| someone goes in to cast his or her ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| they think, okay, it's these sweet old folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| who work the polls at the election place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| And it is the folks who work the polls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| at the election place, but it's so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| It's Knox County's IT department who did a fantastic job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| of making sure that all voter registration information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| stayed safe and that we were able to get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| and get everything running on time and safely every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| It was the Sheriff's Department making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| that we could transport things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| to and from polling places safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| It was a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| As you know, we have 53, 54 different facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| that we vote in on election day that are schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| Being able to work with Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| they're really, really great to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| helping us figure out all the logistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| of making sure that we were able to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| while we're still able to keep the school activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| at arm's length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| The public building authority was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| in helping us get absentee ballot space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| As you know, I've talked about this many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| in a typical presidential election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| we'd have about 6,000 people, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| that voted absentee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| We had almost 21,000 in this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| So we needed more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| We needed more materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| PVA was really great in helping us to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| And then, you know, certainly not least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| but I'll just mention these last in closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| is the health department on very short notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| with the thousands of other things they have going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| helped us set up a COVID-19 voting site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| to help folks be able to vote on election day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| that otherwise would have either been quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| or tested positive and would not have had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| to exercise their right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| And last thing I just wanted to touch on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| is obviously we voted 222,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| I just found this out yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| over 40,000 of those folks were first-time voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| And obviously that lends a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| to the election itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| but I think that's really exciting for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| as an administrator to be able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| that we have 40,000 folks in this election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| who voted for the first time in this election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| and they were able to, by and large, do so safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| So once again, in closing, I want to thank commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| number one, for what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5279)|

| 1:28:32| All right, moving on to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| We have one presentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| This is item number three on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| This is a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| regarding the Knox County Rescue Funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5320)|

| 1:28:47| We're going to start with Mr. Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Then we'll go to Mr. Wayne Wagner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5330)|

| 1:29:10| My name is Jeff Bagwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Public Information Officer for Rural Metro Fire 160,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| North Campbell Station Road in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Just given our monthly report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| for the Rural Metro Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Our engine companies responded in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| to 902 medical first responder calls, 86 car crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| 81 residential structure fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| 10 commercial structure fires or alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| nine hazard material incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| 212 special duty assignments that your lift assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| of your invalid care people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| and smoke investigations and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| 282 still assignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| which is your car fires for a total of 1,582.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| With regards to residential fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| we responded to properties valued at over $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| and had a loss of only 186,585.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| So when you calculate that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| that means that we saved approximately 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| of the structure value that we responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| If you've ever wondered what the busiest fire station is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5414)|

| 1:30:33| from midnight until 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| From the fire prevention side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| with our partnership with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| we added three new educational videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| on our YouTube media library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| We had a little over 11,000 views for the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| representing 1,243 hours of program time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| logging 80,000 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| We eventually had six in-person events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| that had approximately 1,600 contact hours in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| And we also conducted six virtual programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| utilizing Skype or Zoom platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| Total contacts via all the conduits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| was approximately 13,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| Support across Knox County remains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| at about the same average as far as 47 to 48%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| With it being December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5478)|

| 1:31:21| as well as fire season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| we thought it might be appropriate to share some fire facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| for the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| The U.S. Fire Departments respond to an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| of 770 home structure fires per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| that began with decorations, excluding Christmas trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| These fires cause an annual average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| of two civilian fire deaths, 30 civilian fire injuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| and $11 million in direct property loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| which affects the taxable property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Electrical distribution or lighting equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5512)|

| 1:32:03| when something that could burn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| such as furniture, bedding, curtains or decorations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| were too close to the candle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Candle fires peak in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| with 12% of all home fires starting from candles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| And lastly, for those candle lovers out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Christmas Day is the peak day for candle fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| with almost three times the daily average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Don't want to be gloom and doom during this holiday season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| but please urge your folks to very simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| be careful and be smart with those decorations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Lastly, please remember that our doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5557)|

| 1:32:52| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| We will turn it over now to Mr. Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Mr. Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you, Noss County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| for allowing us some time to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| funding for Noss County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Most of these, though, within the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| there was an MOU signed by Noss County Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| and Noss County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| approved funding from July 1 of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| to December 31st of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| And on the 14th of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| I had the honor of speaking to Noss County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| at the workshop and was asked about the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| and we have asked that the MOU be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| and extended for at least 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| instead of what the committee's recommendation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| six months on the renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| After reviewing the document that Dwight VandeVeet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| has sent out from the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| it seems that Noss County Rescue, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| is looking at a six-month renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| instead of a 12-month renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| And I have one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| since Dwight's gonna be on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| one of the questions that I've been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| by the officers of the rescue squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| is why in the Fire and Rescue Technical Committee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| committee recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| that there is a committee that's being set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| but there's no rules for that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| and we would like to see rules for that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| before the MOU is ever signed to develop that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| So I hope that someone will consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| before they put the whole committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| And a memo from Dwight to the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and Mayor Jacobson states that the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| does recommend renewing all first responders MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| for the balance of FY21 and at the current funding levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| Assuming commission approves this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| all the agencies will be funded June 30th through June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| and funding will be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| for the three emergency agencies listed in MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| First, I wanna thank you all for the six-month renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| That's very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| but it's very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| for the Knox County Rescue Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| to be able to put together a functioning budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| on a six-month basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| And again, we would ask that consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| be given to 12-month funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| We hope you give consideration to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| and right into December 31st of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| And again, at the 14th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Knox County Rescue was asked to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| commission with a 90-day total expenditure sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| which we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| And at the conclusion of my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| I will be happy to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| And I also like to remind you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| that under the advisory memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| on identification of essential critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| infrastructure workers during COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| and under the heading of law enforcement, public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| and other first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| bullet number one states fire and rescue services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| search and rescue personnel are listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| as essential critical infrastructure workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| during COVID-19 response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Our folks have been working very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| along with the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| to protect our folks in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| that has to deal with COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| The Knox County Rescue has continued to provide service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| without interruption, despite the looming lack of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| The men and women of Knox County Rescue remain here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| The vast majority of Knox County Rescue members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| volunteer their time, skills, and service to Knox Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| We're just now asking for some reciprocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| of that service and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Thank you for your time to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| in support of Knox County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you, Mr. Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| I'm not seeing-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5827)|
| 1:37:07| So I'm gonna ask Dwight Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| Actually, Mr. Wagner, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| just state your address for the record as well, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| Okay, 7804 Grace Mott Boulevard, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5842)|
| 1:37:22| Mr. Vandervate, if you would, join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| And you have the virtual podium, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| on behalf of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| If I could just confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I hope that all members of commission have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| and had a chance to review the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| of the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| And what I might do is go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| some of the highlights of that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| And in doing so, I'll address some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| of Mr. Wagner's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| and then we'll be glad to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| that commission might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And if you would, just both of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| state your name and address for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| or just name and department for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| You don't need-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Dwight Vandervate, I'm chief operating officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| for Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| Jenny Holden, director of Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Go ahead, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| I hope all of you have had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| to review the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| The Fire and Technical Rescue Committee was formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| in March of 2020 for the purpose of providing guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| to the mayor for his budget proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| to commission for FY21, for the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| and we were unable to meet as a group more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| and begin the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So we recommended to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| and commission approved six-month memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| of understanding to keep the agencies funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| at 100% of their requested level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| for the first half of the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| and give the committee the opportunity to do its work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| That has worked out fine for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| And the committee was able to meet on a number of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| The committee was able to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| all of the first responder chiefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| including Knox County Rescue, Karnes Volunteer Fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| excuse me, Karnes Fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| and had some additional time for internal meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| and conversations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And out of that came this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| and the recommendations that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| You've seen the background research and the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| I'm not gonna review those for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| You've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| We'll be glad to answer any questions at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| I'd rather focus on what I see are the key components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| which are the recommendations of the committee to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| First and foremost, we recommend full funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| for the balance of FY21 for all of the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| at the same level at which they're presently funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| and that does include Knox County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| And we plan to have those memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| before commission at the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Would remind commission that these are reimbursable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| They are reimbursable on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| So the agencies, even if we had them before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| at this month, they actually would not submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| requests for reimbursement until April 1st of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| So they are all required to pre-fund their year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| So they'll request reimbursement on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| but they do report data to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| that we share with commission on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| So first and foremost, everyone's funding is recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| uninterrupted for the balance of FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| Two is a procedural change that would clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| some verbiage in the MOU that helps coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| a more effective response within the fire service districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| that are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Number three, which is I think the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| we'd really like to talk about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| is to take the concept that we've worked under this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| expand it and make it a permanent standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| committee of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| We propose expanding the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| One of the things we learned is we really cannot do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| without having our partners in emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| So we propose to have not just those three that we fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| but also rural metro, a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| because obviously a county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| is a key partner in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| representatives from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| health department, finance, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| And you can see the composition of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| as we propose it in the findings of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| We really feel very strongly that that is a great direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| These things have been dealt with on an informal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| or an ad hoc basis over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| And we think that it is time to deal with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| in a more formal and structured way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| And then fourth, and I'll come back to number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| in a minute, but fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| what we propose is under our current model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| these agencies individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Carnes, Seymour, and the Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| come to the mayor's office and lobby for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| These are separate one-off conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| that they will have in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| I suppose, with commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| In other cases, they'll come to finance and mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| and they'll make their case for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| and stipulated request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| And those requests have typically been granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| as you see in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| One of the things that we found is a great need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| to change that model and actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| a collective conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| of all the emergency service providers at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| so that we can identify gaps in emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| so that we can get a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| of the capacities and capabilities of these agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Under our previous model, Rural Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| who answers 87% of the calls for service in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| wasn't even at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| You only had those agencies who were requesting funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| So a key component of these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| and the committee as we propose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| is it brings everybody to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| for an ongoing conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| about the state of emergency services in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| And we can bring to commission and to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| a set of funding recommendations that is better informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| that has been collectively made and considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| and has all the stakeholders in the room at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| understanding their relationship with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| The sort of ad hoc and one-off model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| that we've been using just isn't effective anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| That does bring me, I wanted to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| one of my friend, Mr. Wagner's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| I will tell you that when Wayne Wagner speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| in emergency services, he is an EF Hutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| He is an old and dear friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| He was Knox County's first fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| There aren't many of us in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| that are old enough to know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| but he was Knox County's first fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| His is an opinion that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| So we did a little bit more research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| after Wayne spoke last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| To the subject of rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| we propose this as a standing committee of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| So it would be a very different environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| It would be as all your other committees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| subject to the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| We would observe Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| And then I would assume we would reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| to the clerk's office to take minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| We would probably ask the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| to staff these meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| So this would be a formal functioning committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| or subcommittee of commission authorized by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| And so it has all the structure and framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| that any other subcommittee of commission might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| In terms of concern over funding, while we share that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| I am not sure that it is viable for us to enter an MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| that extends past the end of the 2021 fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| You would be extending into a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| that does not yet exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| We would recommend against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| I would want everybody to know these are all good agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| We will, as the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| on behalf of the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| and on behalf of the former committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| and I would hope a reconstituted committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| we will look after the interests of these agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| and we will not let them find themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| in an unmanageable or an untenable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| I do think some difficult decisions may have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| If you look at the history of rescue squads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| what might've made sense in the 1950s and 1960s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| may or may not make sense in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| That is a conversation that we, as the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| are not equipped to have on our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| but we certainly think that in this larger committee context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| with your major fire providers and the rescue squad there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| that is the place to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| And again, as we mentioned in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| one of the key takeaways was just the level of commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| that all of these agencies have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Each and every one of them is committed to their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Each and every one of them is committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| to the same goal we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| that's to make Knox County as safe as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| but we cannot continue with everybody existing in a vacuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| and not together on the overall mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| of public safety in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| So I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| I think that sort of hits the highlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| but certainly be glad to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| the commission may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| Thank you, Mr. VandeVeet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Open the floor to questions if you'd like to enter in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| or raise your hand in the participation section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Dwight, I commend your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| I know this has not been an easy task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| and I do absolutely support that it's a step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Probably my one concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| and I'm certain that your group must have talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| is the idea of having all these entities come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| basically competing for the same dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| because the ultimate goal is to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| of all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| no matter which end of the county you're living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| and recognizing that we have so many different models here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| from a rescue squad that is a rescue team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| to a rescue squad that services the entire county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| to a small volunteer fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| that has its little corner of our community also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| And having all this at the same table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| without entering into an extremely competitive system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| in the spirit of everybody wanting to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| they get their piece of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| I'm certain your committee must have kind of discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| what this dynamic could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Yes, ma'am, we certainly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| and we don't underestimate the complexity of the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| Just a couple of considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| This recommendation is driven in part by the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| that this is the model that we have used for 15 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| for the Homeland Security District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| And it is, while it may seem a little counterintuitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| it is surprisingly effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| when the subject matter experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| and all of these agencies are the subject matter experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| come together and explain what they propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| where they see their gaps in capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| where they see areas that they would like to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| in a meeting of their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| who will sometimes offer contradictory ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| who will sometimes offer complimentary ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| who will sometimes offer opportunities for partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| And it is a model that has served us well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| in Homeland Security for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| And frankly, it has a certain element of candor and honesty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6580)|
| 1:49:49| that you appreciate when the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| as opposed to the individual meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| where people will come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| and just talk strictly about their own agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| when everybody is there together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| and all cards are on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| and all the subject matter experts are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| there is a level of candor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| and there is a level of directness and expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| that really, it brings value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| I'm assuming that my partner, Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| is on the line somewhere too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| One of the other things I would mention is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| when we come in, we know in any given year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| about what we are spending globally on emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| So we will start the agencies with an explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| that these are the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| that we think we can recommend to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| for the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| How can we distribute these dollars most effectively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| How can we maintain your viability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| How can we maintain your viability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| How can we make sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| is able to continue to operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| And at the same time, recognize the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| that there is a limited amount of money available to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| And they're tough conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| I don't mean to indicate that is not the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| but particularly in an open meeting context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| as opposed to individual meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| coming into the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| it's a surprisingly productive model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6677)|
| 1:51:17| I appreciate that feedback very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| I see a hands up from Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| and Schoonmaker, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| When will this be meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Is this a quarterly meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| And when do you need our person that we'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| serve on this board through commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Commissioner, I am looking to you guys for direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| If this is our recommendation and the mayor does support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| if it's the will of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| if I get the sense that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| supports this direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| we'll have a resolution to you in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| And obviously, the fourth Monday in January approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| we'd probably start in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| And then I would think we would meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| probably monthly initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| But I mean, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| this committee is going to have to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| They'll elect a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| They'll get guidance from the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| on Open Meetings Act notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| I'll have to confer with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| But if we sense that commission supports this approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| I'll have a resolution to you in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| And we'd like to have our first meeting in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| Mr. Vandervee, great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Did you say you were recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| that this be a standing committee of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| I would recommend, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| the report suggests the composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Pretty straightforward and it just guarantees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| that all the agencies are represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| and that we have the staff support that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| The mayor would, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| those nominations for the most part are pro forma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| because the chiefs are the chiefs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| And the director of the Emergency Communications District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| is the director of the Emergency Communications District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Really, frankly, it would be his staff representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| and his representative from Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| would be the only sort of discretionary nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| And then we would just assume commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| would select their own designate to serve on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| So other than that, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| they're all just agency representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Well, typically a standing committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| is just members of commissioners only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| that serve on the standing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| but we could certainly do it as a regular boarding committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| That's my error in the term of art, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Yeah, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| Yes, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| Dwight, I want to address one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| that Mr. Wagner spoke of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| And I understand the need to do the six month funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| while you're doing the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| But, and if you said this, I'm sorry, I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| But starting with next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| will we go back to a yearly funding cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| to help them with their planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| That was our intent this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| The mandate of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| was to have a set of recommendations for all of FY21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| and COVID happened and 2020 happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| And so we were just scrambling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| and the best option seemed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| just to grab continuity for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| and give the committee a chance to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| And now we're trying to grab a little bit more continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| We actually would probably take these out of MOUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| and go back to defined service contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| and their 12 month contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Wagner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| did you get your questions answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Did you have any suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| Yes, ma'am, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| because I did get an email from your chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| and I just want to make sure that you're okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| with what is being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Yeah, do I give the answers I want to hear on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| And I will carry it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| I don't think I addressed who I represent when I opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| but I am the vice chair of the Noss County Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| and have been at now for about six months and enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| Again, I've been around emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| in Noss County since 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| I know I don't look at them, but it's been a fun ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| and what you're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| is something we tried back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| And so I have a little bit of knowledge about all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| and I'm glad Dwight and them are working on it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Thank you all for listening to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| Yeah, thank you for your service also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Commissioner Smith and Lundy, if you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Okay, you're all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| All right, seeing no hands further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| We don't have anything to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| but I would like to sort of push if there's any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| if anybody has any objection to Mr. VandeVate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| proceeding with the formation of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| bringing a resolution in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| and then us going through the motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| I would say speak your objection now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Otherwise, we've all got the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| and I believe we should let them continue on with their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| to a long-term resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| So, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| I do have a question about how we go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| Do we, does this need to come from the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| or just from the full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| I think that, I'm pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| that we could just bring this directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| I don't think this has to go to rules first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| but I could double check that offline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| and it'll either, we could either go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| if we needed to, we could go through rules first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| before coming here, but we could check that offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| Regardless, we wouldn't vote on anything until January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| so we'll bring it in proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| I can work with Mr. VandeVate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| Any other thoughts on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair, thank you for your permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| Mr. Daly, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| Yeah, I don't think it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| would have to come to the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| because a resolution that Dwight would bring forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| would be in there that it would be a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| So we'll double check, but I wouldn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| Okay, all right, thank you, Mr. VandeVate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| and thank you very much for bringing this good work to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| And please proceed, we will talk offline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| on how to bring it best before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| It is now finished on our presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| and we will move into the first segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| I want to remind everybody who is about to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| that you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Please keep an eye on the clock to respect everybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Once the clock hits, I will jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| and please wrap up your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| I really do not want to get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| where we have to mute somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| but please focus your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| so we can get everybody an opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| I'm going to walk down the list of who I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| in the first sort of block order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| The first few would be Richard Cunningham, Casey Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| Mary Linda Schwartzbart, Charles Albawi, Ashley Capps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| and Janet, it says Alisa G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| I'm not exactly sure if that's two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| or if that's the last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| but those of you who've heard your name kind of be ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| please be in the on-deck circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| And our IT department will bring you in as in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| So we will start with Mr. Richard Cunningham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| Mr. Cunningham, if you would please turn your camera on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| Please state your name and your county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| and you have three minutes to address commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| Thank you, Richard Cunningham, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| I first of all, I'd like to thank county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| for this opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| The public forum is certainly well appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| First, I'd like to express my support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| for the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| This would be a wonderful addition to our city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| and something all citizens could rally around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| It's truly a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| After 2020, that'd be a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| This segues nicely into my next topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| On the other hand, our Knox Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| has recommended canceling spring sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| This would be two springs in a row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| that our children have been denied the opportunity to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| How much more are we going to put our kids through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| when they have little to no risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| This is simply unconscionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| Our Board of Health continues to double down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| on mandates and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| that have no basis or data to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| In fact, at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| they were seeking mandate authority for surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| and requesting yet another failed lockdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| They have continued to restrict restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| yet they have no data showing any viral contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| For five months, this board has pushed mandates and actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| and they have clearly failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| They have spread fear and panic among our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| This fear has a direct effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| on the health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| Despite your best efforts, this is a virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| and it will spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| Some very prominent people, including in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| who all follow the five core actions have become infected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| It's no one's fault it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| It is detrimental to blame the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| for the failure of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| yet that is what we constantly hear from the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| despite them not following their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| This hypocrisy is rampant at all levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| from our Board of Health upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| Just yesterday, we learned that Dr. Deborah Burks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| of the White House Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| who is often cited by our own Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| implored us to stay home and away from our family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| over Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| Yet now we find that she traveled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| to one of her vacation homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| with four generations present outside her household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| Our own Board of Health had a similar situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| over Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| It is long past time for a new direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| We need new leadership from the newly established committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| to provide transparency and reassure our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| that we can care for them COVID or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Too many have missed appointments, screenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| and health maintenance, resulting in a sicker population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| not due to COVID itself, but COVID fear and panic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| Knox County deserves better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| Yes, our hospitals are busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| as they always are at this time of year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| but the capacity is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| No one has been or will be turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| Our citizens need to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| instead of a panic-induced message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| we are constantly hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| We can do better, we must do better, and we will do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| Dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| Thank you, Mr. Cunningham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Next up to speak at public forum is Kasey Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| Kasey Field, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| You have three minutes to address County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| Hi, my name is Kasey Field, and I'm here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| Thank you for letting me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| I would like to speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| the County Commission's current proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| to strip the Board of Health of its ability to set policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| and mitigating rules around public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| I'd like to encourage you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| to continue to make measured and thoughtful decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| as we continue as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| to walk through this very difficult time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| Given the current state of the health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| even if we feel there may be some positive changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| that could be made to the public health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| when the crisis is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| it seems to me that the best place to focus our energy now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| is on working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| And that includes, I would hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| our County Commission working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| with our Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| I'd like to take a moment to remind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| that one of the reasons our American system of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| has worked so well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| is because of various built-in checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| One important check exists in the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| of appointed professional bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| that provide a counterbalance to our elected bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| The architects of our American government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| knew that during times of crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| when it's absolutely understandable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| that everyday people like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| will have increased fear and anxiety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| we need our well-established institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| to act as a backstop against some of our worst impulses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| and to guide us in a way that is level-headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| and insulated from shifting political winds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| Right now, we need our Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| that was appointed by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| to shepherd us through this public health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| They're experts in their field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| and they're bound by high ethical and professional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| to protect the health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| I don't know what it's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| to have had to make the difficult decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| that you all have had to make over the last 10 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| and will have to continue making for the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| but I would like to encourage you as our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| to set our dear community on a bit of a course corruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| towards unity over division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| towards working together for good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| instead of attacking each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| and towards supporting our Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| I want to assure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| that as our elected officials right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| although you may most often hear from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| who are at far ends of the political spectrum, who are angry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| there are many of us in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| who believe that deep down we know how to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| despite our perceived differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| and that there's a way through this crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| where at the end we can be proud of ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| and know that we did the best we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| to take care of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7521)|

| 2:05:35| your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7535)|

| 2:05:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7539)|

| 2:05:42| I'm a lifelong Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| I vote in every election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| I live in Commissioner Kyle Ward's fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| Thank you to commissioners and to Chair Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| for providing a safe opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| to the commissioners who took time to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| and respond to my emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| and to the staff of our Knox County Health Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Health Department and Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| Tennessee has become the nation's leader in new COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| This is not a number one status that I'm proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| Relying on personal responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| evidently doesn't seem to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| You have heard from those who support the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| from those who do not support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| and from outsiders who oppose any restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| I will not repeat anything you've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| You see the Knox County COVID numbers increase daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| More deaths, new cases, active cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| more Knox County residents in our hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| Another number you may not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| Do you know that Mask Up Knoxville Facebook group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| has more than 9,300 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| who support businesses that require masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| When I have a medical issue, I take my doctor's advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| not that of my best friend or casual acquaintance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| or someone with no medical background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| We have great medical professionals in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| I am sure you have access to the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Whose medical advice do you follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| Do you think as elected commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| that you should follow the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| of our medical team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| They see the daily impact of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| has on our residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| How many times did you beg to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| your parents considered harmful for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| Did they let you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Yes, you can cripple the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| but how will dissolving it help our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| to stay as healthy as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Will it diminish the daily numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| lessen the impact on small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| frontline workers, hospitals, and the rest of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| What other tools do you have in your toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| to help those affected by this pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| What resources do you have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| to help folks who live in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| You have been elected to make good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| on behalf of all Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| That's what good leaders do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| Or will you continue to watch more of our friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| your constituents whom you were elected to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| experience the impact of COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| It is your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| My friends and I support local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| mass-compliant businesses and the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| Please do not support Commissioner Kyle Ward's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| to change the Board of Health to an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| Last week, this relevant Merle Haggard classic came to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| If we make it through December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| everything's gonna be all right, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| We will need to make it through a few more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| I want to make it through these next months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| without experiencing COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| Thank you, Ms. Schwartzbart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Our next block of speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| just to get ready in the on-deck circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Charles Albawi, Ashley Capps, Janet, Elisa Gee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| Again, I'm not exactly sure if that's a last name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| or two different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| Rebecca Saldivar and Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| We'll next go to Mr. Charles Albawi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| Mr. Albawi, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| My name is Charles Albawi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| I would like to thank the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| This is an opportunity for the residents of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| to get more involved in how our budget is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| So let's talk about the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| It seems as if you all are just going through the motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| that you have been talking offline about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| and that you really don't want the people's involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| But this has united both conservatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| and progressives alike to speak out against the waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| We have rights over you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| The public has rights over our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| We have rights over how our money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| So in the event that you think it is a foregone conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| that taxpayer dollars will be spent on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| we have organized and we have demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| One of those potential demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| is that we own the land of which the stadium is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| and that Mr. Boyd and the Smokies will pay rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| and property tax value to us to be put in a fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| for free afterschool and summer school programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| for all children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| We also have other strict conditions and quotas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| for any contracts that are entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| in regards to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| That's in the event that you assume taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| will just be given to the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| We have demands and we are organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| On a second issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| we have the health board advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| Let's talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| You're talking about making a Smokies task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| but you're going to make the health board advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| So when the people start making demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| about the task force, will you make it advisory as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| and take away the rights that you claim you're giving us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| And let's talk about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| 10% of people who get it die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| 20% of the people who survive it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| get a mental illness within three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| The more people that get sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| the more people in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| the more they're overwhelmed, the more people die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| the more those numbers go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| Let's talk about what your priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| Is our priority baseball or is it helping the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| The public debt you want to issue for the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| can be issued for programs for small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| the middle class, the poor and the working class alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| But instead you want to give it to one team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| and one set of developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| But we're not going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| We will have a say in how our money is spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| and how our contracts are divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| So thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7900)|

| 2:11:51| Mr. Capps, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| You have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| Okay, I'm unmuted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| My name is Ashley Capps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| I'm an Oswell native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| I've been a businessman here for the last 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| best known as a concert promoter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| but I'm also an investor in some other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| including a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| I'm talking tonight in support of no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| to the Board of Health's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| It's the wrong time, the wrong move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| Three days ago, I don't know if you noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| but Forbes Magazine, the esteemed business magazine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| just cited Tennessee as the number one riskiest state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| to visit during Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| I don't know if you saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| You ought to go look for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| The reason is because of the failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| of our state's leaders to lead during this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| I'm asking all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| especially all of the members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| but really everyone listening to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| to think for a moment about your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| about your friends, your neighbors, your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| Most of them have to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| And I want you to think about their freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| in going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| The freedom that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| they have to go to work to support their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| to support themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| And they deserve to have the freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| not to be carelessly exposed to the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| while they are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Their families need to have the confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| that they're working in an environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| where they are not going to be needlessly put in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| You know, this is a pretty common thing in our society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| because, you know, if you think about the freedom you expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| when you say, get on the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| you expect that nobody's going to be coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| the same side of the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| that you're going down in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| There are laws against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| It makes the interstate free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| and it gives you the freedom to have the confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| that you can drive on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| Sometimes people break the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| but the reality is the law serves as an effective deterrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| and makes the entire system work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| Let's talk a minute about our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| Everyone wants to see our businesses stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| I don't know anyone that supports a lockdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| And there is now plenty of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| that consistent protective measures such as mass mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| are actually good for the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| that the communities in which there are mass mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| and protective measures in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| their economies are thriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| much beyond other communities in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| There's research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| It's easily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| I strongly suggest that you research it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| It's very important information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| So, you know, the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| I can't imagine the pressure these folks have been under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| They've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| And am I running out of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| You're out of time, Mr. Capps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| I don't have a counter for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8110)|

| 2:15:52| I support all businesses that enforce mask wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| and social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| All of these people are doing their very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| to help us live the principles of the volunteer spirit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| which has always been about doing right by each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| by our state, by this great country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| Here are stories of three small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8170)|

| 2:16:15| and enforce proper masking to serve customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| First, PokéWorks in Western Plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| has only been open a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| and they're going strong today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| Business is so good that they're opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8186)|

| 2:16:39| Who doesn't know Gus's Good Times Deli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| a Knoxville institution for 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| It's a destination that locals and out-of-towners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| return to during UT sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| and really for any excuse to stop in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8209)|

| 2:17:05| They need our support with full masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| to keep their employees safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| and to serve their signature sandwiches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| to future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8232)|

| 2:17:17| serving locals and visitors from across this nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| in two locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8240)|

| 2:17:29| they require 100% masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| As a recently naturalized American and Tennessean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| and as a local leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Yasin embodies what we, as Tennessee volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| are called to do, that's to care for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| Each customer generates vital economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| for our county, which then creates new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| I believe that COVID-compliant businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| who value safety first will do just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| but only if we all help them serve us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8276)|
