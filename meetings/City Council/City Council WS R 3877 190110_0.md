| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=30)|
| 0:00:50| Going on to the private market, but doing so in a controlled way that reflects community needs and works in a way to be beneficial to Oakwood-Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=50)|
| 0:01:00| and to the general area as well, and work well to not only keep that on the tax rolls, but do it in a way that's really beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=60)|
| 0:01:11| And that provides terrific opportunities. So that is what our vision is on the redevelopment piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you, Dr. Lyons. I think one of the first things that we needed to do when this site became available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| again, it had been looked at a couple of years ago prior to my time in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| And at the time, I think Tenova was not ready. They were still working through some of their business plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| When it came back to the city as an opportunity, one of the first things we needed to do was to do a full assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| And so Glenn is going to come up, talk about that assessment, talk about costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| I would say that Chief Thomas and Chief Sharp and Dr. Lyons and I have worked on a number of sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| I think one guiding principle is that if we are going to invest $40 million into a location for KPD, KFD, court, and the pension offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=111)|
| 0:02:02| it needs to benefit those users. But ideally, we can also address a disinvestment location within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| I think many of you know that we had looked at the Knoxville College campus as one opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| and that site did not pan out. And the timing with this opportunity was very nice. It dovetailed into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=135)|
| 0:02:26| And so I'm going to turn it over to Glenn Richter, who will come up, talk about the facility assessment and where we are with numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| Good evening. As you know, we were tasked with assessing this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| specifically to see what the opportunities and the constraints that pertain to situating the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| and the fire department and the municipal court within this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| We did this in four steps. The first step was to develop a program for the police department and the court facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| the fire department, and later the pension board was added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Thanks, Glenn, real quick. Can people in the back here, Glenn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| You might want to pull that mic from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Hopefully this is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| So the second step, so that first step of programming was to develop a square foot requirement for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=197)|
| 0:03:26| And the second step was to do a facilities analysis on the existing buildings and to analyze their condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| and their quality and the opportunities and potentials that are available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| Once we had those two pieces, we were able to look at master plan concepts for the site and how it could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| We looked at a couple of different alternatives before settling on one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| And then finally, once we had that direction, we were able to come up with an opinion of probable cost for budget on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| So that first step, the programming situation, we met with the police department, with Chief Gast and Holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=237)|
| 0:04:08| and took their base program and expanded upon it and elaborated on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| looking at every single space that would be required within a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| putting a square footage requirement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| We did the same thing walking through the municipal court building facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| Then we met with the fire department and Chief Sharp and his crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| And then pension board, we actually did not program, but that number was provided to us from the pension board themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| So the end result is that we have a program of approximately 165,000 square feet requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=280)|
| 0:04:50| And I'll say two qualifications here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| One, as Dave mentioned, this is a preliminary report, so it is an ongoing, evolving report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| As you dig deeper into the process at each level, it will become more refined and more precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| Different issues will appear in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| While we were doing the programming, at the same time we did the facilities assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| We walked through the buildings, we toured the buildings, we did inspections on the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| We met with the maintenance facility people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| We reviewed the documentation on the building, the existing plans, previous reports that have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| And came up with the following key observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| The first deals with the main hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| We quickly were able to eliminate that as being a feasible opportunity to locate the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=343)|
| 0:05:55| It's a maze if you've ever been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| It's just a maze of corridors, additions that have gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| It started in 1930 and up through 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| And economically, it just would not be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| It would not provide a good facility and it would not be economically feasible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| The Magdalena Clark Tower is a little bit different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| It was built in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| It has three levels of parking garage below it and then multi-story facility above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| It's an old facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| The infrastructure would have to be replaced, all the mechanical, all the electrical systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Generally, it's structurally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| It's aged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| But the main problem with that building is it's 160,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| It's a lot of square footage and a lot of floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| The cost involved in that compared to the size of the building and the level of occupancy is not a very good return on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=416)|
| 0:07:13| So then we turn to the South Complex, what I'm calling the South Complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| which is a series of three buildings, the professional office building, what's called the Central Annex, and the Women's Pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| All those buildings were built from the 1980s on, so 1980s and 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| They're in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| The exterior envelope is pretty solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| They need new roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| They need to be new caulked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| But the essence of that envelope is pretty sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| There is also approximately 175,000 square feet of space in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| It matches up fairly well with the requirements of the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| So we focused on that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| Associated with that is the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| There are two parking decks that have 720 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| The police department requires approximately 300 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| So this is a good fit in terms of having a controlled, secure parking area for staff, employees, and the patrolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=497)|
| 0:08:29| There's lots of surface parking around the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| The lower south lot ideally has approximately 150 parking spaces and a lot of surface area to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=513)|
| 0:08:45| Then there's one additional parking area of approximately 100 spaces that's located across Huron Street from the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=525)|
| 0:08:56| So there's plenty of adequate parking, there's secure parking, and that all fits very well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| Once we did the programming and the assessment of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| we were able to then look at the potential concepts for developing the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| In looking at that, there were three key challenges, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Usually when you talk about design, you like to narrow it down to those couple of ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| couple of factors that are going to determine the course that you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| So those three challenges, the first one is the entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| The interesting thing about dealing with the police and the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| is there's a requirement for multiple types of access to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| Not the least of which is that you have a main public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| So there's a need for a public access, but there's a need for multiple access by the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| And those accesses are secure access for the patrolman to park and to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=604)|
| 0:10:13| to bring in evidence into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| You have training facility that requires both access of public and the patrolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| And as I said before, you have the main access, the main public event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| Complicating that is that you have the municipal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| the high level of security that's required in terms of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and the desire to have a single point of control for that access for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| So that means that the municipal court and the police department have a single unified access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=646)|
| 0:10:57| The second challenge is the municipal court itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| So the facilities that are there now do not fit well with the municipal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| Municipal court building has several requirements to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| One is that you have a fairly large space, sight lines throughout that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| The existing facilities all have a column network that's based on a 25, 30 foot grid, which limits your sight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| There's also a ceiling height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Most of the floors in this existing facility are relatively low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Not extraordinary low, but just not high enough to facilitate a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| And then thirdly, the loading conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| When you put an assembly together with a lot of square footage, you have a lot of people, you have a lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| The loading conditions are significantly different than an office facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| So it requires being on the ground floor of an existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| So those conditions do not exist in any of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| So the alternative there then is to look at the municipal court as a new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=722)|
| 0:12:12| And finally, the third element that thrives part of the design is storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| Of the 165,000 square feet, a considerable portion of that is storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| The police department has over 30, well, we program 35,000 square feet, but the reality is that they use much more than that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| So they're going to have to consolidate their storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| But the storage is a significant portion of their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| So how we deal with that storage is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Now there's some elements that offer some opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| The parking garage, if you notice a disparity in the numbers, there's 720 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| The department needs about 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| There's some extra room in those garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| So maybe we can utilize those garages for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| The fire department as well has storage requirements and access requirements to that storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| So that's a third portion that drives the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| But taking this, we developed multiple alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| We reviewed these with the city and focused down on one of those alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| In your packet, you have, I think, three alternatives that we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| But the one that we settled the focus on is what we call Scheme A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| And again, the driver on this design is the location of the municipal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| and the entry point for the public, that secure entry point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| So in this scheme, we moved that municipal court, a new facility, up onto the Emerald Avenue area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| and located it so that we could share a lobby and entry point with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=843)|
| 0:14:12| Part of the, that I failed to mention, one of the intricacies of this design is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| the levels of all the buildings are, there's three separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| And their levels don't necessarily all line up and they don't all meet, connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| So that lobby area that serves as the municipal building lobby and as the police department lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| would also act as the connector that would connect two of the buildings together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| So the program for the police department fits nicely within the professional office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| and the central annex building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| If we locate that lobby in such a way that it's the connector between those two buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| and then also the connector to the municipal building, municipal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Glenn says there's a few folks in the back. Will you talk a little bit about colors and shapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| where the oval is the connector and court is to the left. Will you please do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Okay. So in this diagram, we have three colors. The dark blue, four colors I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| The dark blue is the police department and the rectangle to the left is the municipal court building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=917)|
| 0:15:28| That oval that connects those three elements together which is a little lighter shade of blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| is that lobby that I've been talking about, the connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| The red building is the women's pavilion and that is for the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| The fire department stands pretty uniquely apart from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| There's minimal interaction between the two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Their entrance needs are different. They have much more access to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| and a much lower security level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| So having a separate building, having separate entrance points works very well for the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| They're also located where they have significant parking area down below them in the lower area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| which works well in terms of them being able to bring in their fire trucks when staff comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| Glenn, also in the red building, there's about 2,600 to 3,000 square feet for the pension offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| the pension board. Again, we'll be working with the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Obviously, 5th Avenue, if KPD was completely consolidated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| then the pension board leaving 5th Avenue, having a newer facility, sharing that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| There's adequate room there for both fire admin and for pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| They're also in that red area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| Generally, that's the synopsis on this outline of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| As I said earlier, we looked at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| The municipal court building location kind of keys everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| There's only a couple of locations that that really works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| One, we looked at at the south side of the women's pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| One, we looked at it up on the Huron Street where it could tie the women's pavilion and the central annex together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| None of those worked as well as this combination here that we show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| Glenn, while we have this up, this master plan, site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| I think it's important to note the large white square, that is not green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| That's part of the redevelopment side, what we're calling the north side of the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| That is a to-be-determined location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| We're not sure if that's a 70s-era building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| It's large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| What could be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| We're still exploring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| We have an estimate to do demolition of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| We also have estimates for full renovation of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| We are meeting with other partners in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| I mentioned Dr. Buchanan, Jerry Vagner, the chamber partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| We looked at this with Rhonda Rice and with Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| Could this be some type of office reuse, corporate headquarters reuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Could it be a series of reuses where different organizations take a floor and collectively renovate that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| So at this point, we're showing it as a future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| You'll also notice just below that and to the left is a very small kind of white area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| and that is the historic hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| And Dr. Lyons and I and Mayor Rojero have already had an email with Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| would like to look at that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| It has a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| And if you look at the pictures, historic pictures of the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| there was a large green lawn in front of that, and it's got some really nice features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| And so we'll need to evaluate that building for a potential reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Could it become a centerpiece for redevelopment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| There are costs to keeping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| There are costs for shoring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| But we want to explore all of those options over the next few weeks and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| Unfortunately, now gives a lot of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| That building is almost hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| A lot of people, you wouldn't even know it was there because it's been surrounded by add-on construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| But once you get to a place where you can see it, it is a beautiful structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| And you see the original pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| It provides, I think, we think, fantastic opportunities as a centerpiece of the redevelopment of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| One other part of the concept was many years ago, Emerald Avenue actually ran completely through this campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| I mean, it was a through street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| And so trying to reestablish some level of access along Emerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| and again, the private access for the police department into their parking garage on the east end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| the top of the picture there, is very beneficial where the police can pull in into the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| have their own controlled access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| In the covered parking, there is an exposed deck, have plenty of parking for equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| That's another real benefit from a sustainability standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Parking garages are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Okay, so once we have the concept, we can hone in on the probable cost of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| That is in three phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| The first phase was what we call the north site, which is demolition of the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| redressing it, grading it, doing some minimal landscaping work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| It had a price tag of just over $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| The second phase then would be site work around the new complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| And then the third phase would be renovation of the south complex itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| And that total was $31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| These cost estimates, we consulted construction contractors, we worked with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| we worked with the city engineering department to develop all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And then we ran it through Bulkert and their team and re-evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| And so we feel pretty comfortable about these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Yeah, I mean, it's a preliminary report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Actually this week, Glenn drove down to Franklin where Bulkert has a larger office facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| They spent a day reviewing Glenn's numbers and challenging some of those numbers and having dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| And one of the reasons you received this report on Wednesday was we were still working on those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| I think I feel more comfortable that these numbers are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| I mean, obviously they're still preliminary, but we feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| And we'll jump to the next slide and talk total project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| So the total project cost, we have a series of line items, land acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| which I'm sure you're going to discuss a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Design and project management costs, testing, construction, FF&E, and then the IT costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1342)|
| 0:22:33| All of this brings a total budget of $46,700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| That is for the total project site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| If you take out the north site, which was the $5 million plus the design costs on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| so it was $800,000, that brings the number that we estimate for the fire department, police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1373)|
| 0:23:03| and the court at just around $41 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| Yes, and that number, the 5.8 that you see there, that gets the redevelopment piece ready for the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1387)|
| 0:23:18| And then, of course, it will have real value, and once it gets into the request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| or however we work with the neighborhood and others to come up with a plan for that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| that will obviously be – it turns into a real asset that isn't just outgoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| that sets up for a real positive cash flow and community benefit on the other side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| which we think is a great plus for this entire package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| And to qualify these numbers just a little bit to understand, we put phase one as the north site demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1425)|
| 0:23:54| There's significant dollars to be saved in doing all of the demolition at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| If you piecemeal it, well, one, it becomes much more complicated from a construction standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| because as you remove pieces, you have to keep the other pieces stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| But you also have the whole staging and setup and mobilization costs in terms of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| So to do the entire demolition at one time is a significant saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| So that's why we broke that out as a separate phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| If at some point you determine not to do that, some demolition has to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| in order for the renovation of the fire department, police department buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| And Volkert, Leon has been working, and the Volkert team have also been looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| if we only did enough demolition to only do the KPD site right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| there's a slightly different cost number, but because of the economies we lose with doing all the demolition at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| So we're looking at it both ways, but we wanted to present the total package, the 46,731.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| And Leon or Glenn, correct me, that includes a contingency of either 5% or 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Is that a 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| That includes a 10% contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So we've not presented these numbers with zero contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| This has a 10% contingency in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| And we asked Glenn, I said, Glenn, look, when you evaluate this same message to Volkert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| be conservative in your numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| We want to make sure that this makes sense financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| And we don't come back later and need $8 million or $7 million or $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| And so we asked them to do that and to include a contingency in this estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| I also want to say that Tonova, Tony Benton, and the team at Tonova have been incredibly helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| in opening the doors, the records, the environmental documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Glenn has spent significant time over at the facility looking at old blueprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| They don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| They don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| He would wander in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| They got so comfortable with Glenn, he would come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| But they've been very good about just helping us in this assessment phase, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1568)|
| 0:26:17| We're going to transition to an investment that Tonova has a desire to make off Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| But while Glenn is here and while we have the numbers up and we have that site master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| do we want to ask questions now or talk about Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Why don't we ask a few questions now, and I'm sure there will be some additional questions along Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Okay, I'm going to get back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Councilman Wallace sent you a list of 10 questions, and I'm not going to be his voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| because my voice isn't a whole lot better than his, but he did ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| and I think you got the email sometime today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| You might run down and answer some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Some of those have already been addressed, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Yeah, and I'm going to jump into the ones I answer, which are pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Councilman Wallace asked, could we do a walkthrough of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Could City Council do a walkthrough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| And so the answer is, I mean, obviously I need to look over to Tony Benton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| I believe we would coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| I said yes before I talked to Tony, so I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Yes, we'll do a tour of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Especially it would be great for many of you, the historic hospital is hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| It's a pretty amazing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| So looking at that, we can coordinate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| It said a provision should be added to allow us to cancel at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| This is a non-binding LOI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Would that be an individual tour or a group tour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| I think it depends on schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I've helped facilitate several tours, and I don't mind being the tour guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| and we can do a group tour or individual tours, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| A group tour, you'd need to sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| If we do a group tour, we will meet the sunshine provisions and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| And then the other question was, there was a question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| have we looked at new construction versus adaptive reuse of this existing facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| I think it's difficult for us to do an assessment of new construction right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| because we're not sure what that site would be and site costs and soil conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| I think we're very happy with this estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and we're happy with the sustainability components of reusing existing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and the fact that we've got an existing parking garage that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| the average parking garage is $15,000, $25,000 of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| So we're comfortable with the estimate, but we have not done a full-blown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| If we had a green field, what would the cost be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| We've not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| There was one other, and it's not shown on this map that's right behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| and in front of me, about the other parcels that Tenova is going to retain the right to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| Do we know what disposition may be made of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Are they going to sell them, or what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| So there are, I'll let Tony Benton answer this, there are a couple of parcels that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| one, I believe they are coordinating with the Catholic Diocese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| which is a daycare and a housing facility for nuns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| And then the other is a building, or there's actually two pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| one that we have an interest in, the other we don't necessarily have an interest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| that are owned by a different health care organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And Tony and the Tenova team are working on those negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| and I think what we've, you know, right now it's a gentleman's agreement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| hey, we have an interest in one of those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| to potentially explore some health care, urgent care resources for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| or other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| We also have a schematic in the study that shows the fire department in that lower building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| And so, Tony, do you need to add more to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| No, thanks, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| I think he described quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| There's a number of, as you might guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| a number of pieces of properties and buildings and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Specifically for the daycare and what was the convent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| are no immediate plans to change anything with the daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| and that's kind of a separate lease arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| and we've not determined how the convent area would be used at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| I assume that the NHC facility will remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| That's not part of our ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| And then I believe Dr. Lyons has the balance of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| the good questions that Councilman Wallace had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Right, and I think it might be best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| these questions actually refer in Maine to the pilot that would be on the Middlebrook property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| so it might be good to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| and then engage Councilman Wallace's questions in context after we explain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| You're ready to get to that beyond this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| It's part of our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Before we move on, do you have any questions, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| On this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Is my mic on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| You're live, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| So what is the white part along Woodland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Would that just be the public parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Would that be secure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Would that be security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| I'm not a pointer, so I'm going to jump up here and kind of go old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| So this lower lot is owned by Tenova, and that would be part of the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| The lot, I'm going to jump here, is owned by a different organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| and we have a desire to potentially own that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and Tenova is at this point helping negotiate a potential acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| but that is still early in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| and so we're not sure what that corner looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| but the parcel just south of that with all the parking would be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| It could be used for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| It's good for the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Oftentimes a ladder truck or a large quint will come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| They need to meet with the chief or they need to pick up supplies or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| They can park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| The public, it's overflow parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| It's also good growth space should we have a need for additional growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| for other departments, and so it would be part of that transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| assuming this project moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| So the way this would work, if you had needed to go to municipal court or the KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| would you park down there and then walk up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| The key areas that you would park, so the plan calls for a new parking to be built here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| That would be the direct access into the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| And that would be sufficient for what we think for the municipal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| I guess, would be the busiest time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Yes, and there's also 100 spaces in this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| So you have these two, which have pretty good access here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| This can access, but there's a great change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Yeah, I think the lower lot becomes some type of overflow parking, equipment staging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| It would not be secure with fencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| No, no, not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| I mean, I think we are still early in the programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| so we're at the what are the square footage needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| what are the specialty-to-use type needs so we can get an average cost per square foot for renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| But there appears to be adequate parking with the lot across from the red building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| That is a surface lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| It has the hillopad on it, if you remember, if you've been by there recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| And the new lot, all of that flows fairly well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| and I would say that Glenn and the Volkert folks have done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| We were originally pushing for a new court building down low on that lower lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| but it was just a difficult transition and the parking was difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| That's why we prefer this concept at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Pending any agreement going forward, what's the timeline or, you know, just in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| there's some issues of safety and security that have been brought up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| vagrancy and crimes going on currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| What can be done just in the interim right now to make sure it's secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| and it's not going to spill over some problems into the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Yeah, and Tony can come up and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| We've had this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Tenova owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| They have security and facilities personnel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| There are still medical office facilities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| so there are people visiting their doctor in the complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| I've been up there several times, and I've gotten to know the facility staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| They are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Obviously, there are less eyes on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| There are less people to see if there are issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| So, one, I know that Tony and Tenova are committed to securing the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| but if members of the public see issues, we do need to have those called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| I have heard of one incident or two incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| and, again, I'll talk with Ms. Thomas after the meeting to see what other incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| have happened about perhaps someone who was homeless going into the garage to seek shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| But Tenova does have staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Mr. Brace, I think you and I had talked about this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| but I think making it part of the record is a good idea as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| Can you talk to us about how this opportunity got here, how we got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| Particularly, we're looking at, you know, this was a business decision by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| This was not something that the city sought, but I wanted you to address that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| No, that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| I have had a couple of folks say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| why is the city buying this building and closing the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| And what I've said is the city has not closed the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Tenova, over the last few years, has made the decision that due to the layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| and the age and the condition of these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| that they cannot efficiently provide health care at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| So the hospital closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| That was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| The opportunity came up because as they were deciding to expedite the closure of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| and reinvest in other parts of our community, Tenova North off of Emory Road and Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| Turkey Creek, which is in the city out west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and we'll talk about the Middlebrook investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| As they've decided to reinvest in other parts of town and divest from this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| they contacted us about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| It had been explored previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I know that Christy Branscom, who was in my role previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| and others had looked at this along with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| But at the time, I think Tenova was still in a period of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and getting their arms around this complex and their business decisions about investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| And so, again, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| The city is not closing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| The hospital is closed, and they are in a process of closing out the remaining medical office uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| So this would be, again, I think an opportunity to not have a large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| unutilized medical building in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Does that answer your question, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Just a follow-up on something you had mentioned a little bit earlier where you were talking about growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| And so I wanted to, you know, I know we're in very preliminary stages here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| but if you're thinking about the fact that we're continuing to have academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| and the potential for growth in the departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| are we taking into account what that might look like going forward with this design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Yeah, I think any time you do a large facility, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| this is an opportunity for the police department, fire admin, city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| to review all of their business processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| When you design a new building, it's the time to improve efficiencies, look at how we operate, make sure what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| And I know that Chief Thomas and I know that Chief Sharp and I've talked with the folks over at city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| This is the time to do that, communicate those desires through programming to the design team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| and just to let you know, Volkert Engineering is working with the City Purchasing Department to secure the design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| like we did on Public Works, that will live with this project to its completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Secure the design team, complete programming, do the actual work for the interior demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| do the design work for the interior build-out, and then ultimately move to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| And so getting that team on board, you know, that's not going to be decided by, you know, Dr. Lyons and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| That's going to be decided by the users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| And so I think, yes, we are looking at growth. We always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| I think one of the reasons Volkert is on board is, you know, KPD may say we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| and I'm not saying they've said this, but they need 100,000 square feet of growth space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| And Volkert may say, hey, I think we see 25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| So there's that ongoing design dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Or they may say we need 10,000 and Volkert says you need 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| So that is an ongoing process with any design project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| It's collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I think I've talked with all the chiefs and I've talked with the folks at pension and with the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| I think they're excited about that opportunity to look at their business processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| and make sure that we design something that will be quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| and really a top-notch facility for our community and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| I think to add to that, there is sufficient capacity in the structure there to allow for additional build-out later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| So I think we're well positioned that if there are needs or there are more personnel, KPD or whatever might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| we have some capacity there for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| We're not locked in right at the beginning with the capacity we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Certainly. I'd like to circle back to the safety conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| I know that recently there was, unfortunately not everyone is aware that the hospital is closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| and especially the emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| So I'd like to know what Tenova has in place currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| and what additional measures can be taken so that we don't have another incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| such as someone being dropped off thinking that the hospital is in service and it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| One part of that was the signs are now down that directed people who didn't know it was closed to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| That was unfortunate, but the actual folks who dropped them off were just friends or acquaintances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| I don't know what the relationship was, but there was a series of signs that are now down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| that indicated that a hospital was nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| So the blue hospital, the H signs that you see, those have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| That was a combination of Tenova facilities and our city sign personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| Ann Metz is here. Ann handles marketing and does communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| I think obviously Tenova has attempted to reach out and communicate the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| When you go to the facility, there are signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| There are still security personnel on the campus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| My understanding is the individual that had been shot and dropped at the close, the ER, was actually found by security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| Then an ambulance was contacted and that individual taken to the appropriate trauma center to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| So Tony, I'm not sure if you or others want to talk about your other tools that you're using to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2496)|
| 0:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| We announced the closure and the timeline for the facility on October 23rd and began communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2507)|
| 0:41:57| In as many venues as possible with press releases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| those types of things to make that clear that the facility was indeed closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| As David mentioned, a number of efforts in removing signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| announcing that the hospital, removing it from websites, from Google searches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| all of those different things were made prior to the closing of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| Then signs established that the facility is indeed closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Then I would just emphasize again coverage both in the facility and perimeters with security personnel for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2548)|
| 0:42:37| So currently there is signage there physically on the premises where the ER used to be that says that it is now closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| It is pretty big where people should be able to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Tony, just while you're up there, my understanding, and I may be incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| is that there is also some fencing being installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| As a guy that worked on an ambulance, the old ER used to pull underneath an area where people got dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| That will be fenced so it will be even more obvious over the coming weeks, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| That's going to be fenced so the old ER will even appear to be closed visually with fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| Okay, so the timeline for the fencing is a few weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| I'm not sure, Tony, on the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| As you would expect, the complexity of the building and some of the things that you've seen over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| there's a lot of different areas of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| As we did mention, there are a small number of physician offices that are still seeing patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| for probably about four to six more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| Providing access for those sites while making sure that those other areas are locked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2618)|
| 0:43:48| and locked in a safe manner where safety measures are in place to egress and meeting all of those codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| A lot of work in being able to do that and block off areas of parking so that those are secured areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| As far as completion time, I would ask, Dan, as far as getting all of that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| By the end of January, we would anticipate that all of those measures will be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Okay, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Councilwoman Reuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I guess I'll go by all of those titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| So the cost for demo, does that also include 10% contingency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| So that's not a raw cost for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| And then that includes a total scrape of everything in the green area including the tower or not including the tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| Tower is included in that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| So it would be the white square, everything ringed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| I assume those are trees in the illustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| And the illustration was, we're not sure what that'll look like, but some type of seed and straw, minimal, enough to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| Zero on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| That's what that price tag's for with a contingency of 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Yeah, and let me say this, Glenn, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| The tower building, if it stayed, there's about a half a million dollar reduction in the demo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| Now, look, there's a huge renovation cost with that, but if the tower stayed, there is a reduction of $500,000 to $700,000 in demo costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| So we're looking at and we are open to conversations, walkthrough with developers, something, RFP process for potential of somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2723)|
| 0:45:37| using the buried historic hospital, which I know is, I mean, I have some familiarity with this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| And the possibility of somebody else potentially either buying and or leasing the tower space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| I believe that is the building my husband's office was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| We are open to conversations about somebody else and us not necessarily bearing that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| I think more than being just open, that's the preferred outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| I mean, we would like, for all kinds of reasons, not only the savings of over a half billion dollars for demo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| but to have a presence there potentially corporate through working with the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| potentially having it split into many individual floors where they could be made use of by people with fewer needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2775)|
| 0:46:23| It's a terrific location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| We think it has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| It's got the parking under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| So that would be the preferred outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| So we want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| We're more than open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| We hope to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| And obviously we really hope to get there on the historic part of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| That's definitely preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| I think we're all aware that the alarm bells went off with members of the community last night in looking at the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| with a total demo of all of that historic, obviously very emotional for a lot of people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| And so we want to have all that considered before we go down that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| Our intent was that we would, especially since the demo might start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| we want to get with Knox Heritage and some developers and say what's possible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| We're pretty optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| I mean, we saw what the state of Oakwood School was prior to its being restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| But then again, we'd want to have a little bit of feedback that this was indeed going to be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| But that's definitely what we're intending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And we were very intentional in showing the Clark Tower in white, in a different shade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| and showing that section over the historic building to say, yes, these are opportunities we're very excited to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| and to look into on that master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| So we will get with Knox Heritage, and we'll start to dig into that and see what opportunities exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| And we've done quite a bit of that already with Dr. Buchanan and Jerry Vagner and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Other questions concerning this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| If not, let's talk about mineral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So we're going to move into, if you notice, there is a land acquisition price of a dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| and that is connected to an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| I think it's important to remind folks that Tenova, that facility is not efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| They're reinvesting in additional locations, including Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And so Dr. Lyons will talk about that investment opportunity, that health care investment opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Right. And many of you, thank you, David, many of you are familiar with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| There was quite a bit of a discussion when Tenova's plans were for it to be a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| and were some land use decisions that council make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I think that probably in many folks' memories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| We have worked with Tenova in an allied conceptual plan using the tools that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| that really give us a lot of capacity as a municipal corporation to get a favorable fiscal outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| on this entire package, which is as part of our under, we're starting with a spot we've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2940)|
| 0:49:08| the Tenova St. Mary site we've been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| That's on the tax rolls now for $58 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Now, obviously, getting a sense of value is difficult to do when you've got a hospital that's abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| But the land, the location, everything is incredibly valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| And you do have some seriously valuable building assets that we'll be making use of in the KPD, KFD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| court pension renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And working with Tenova in order to give them plenty of incentive to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2971)|
| 0:49:40| and invest in health care services on the Middlebrook site, we have agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| though this is all a little unusual as I get into in answering Councilman Wallace's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| that we would provide, we would recommend to council that a payment in lieu of taxes of 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| on two parcels there that would be tied to medical use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| They'd be required to do for medical use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| And with that requirement also would limit the potential value of that pilot to $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3004)|
| 0:50:14| Now, what that would end up, to get to the essence of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| that would mean if Tenova somehow chose not to invest there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| there would be no such benefit that would be accruing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| And if their investment was meager, it wouldn't yield a $16 million potential payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| in lieu of taxes value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| On the other hand, if they invested in a very large facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| that would mean they would enjoy no more than the $16 million value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| And one of Councilman Wallace's questions was, well, where exactly did the $16 million limit come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| And that was in a series of discussions that really involved the purchase price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| of being low as possible on the major site, hence a dollar, which is about as low as we can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| and then providing some value to Tenova later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| and then keeping the city from having any financial outlay for purchase price now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| and in fact, no direct outlay even later, just deferred taxation later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| And so that was the package, the agreement that enabled us to get into this site for the dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| also to encourage and work with Tenova, not to keep them, they're staying in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| invested, as David said, both in Turkey Creek and in the North Powell location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| but to keep this Middlebrook site with a major health care component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| And it's located, as you know, right across Middlebrook from other health care services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| so it will complement the delivery of health services in that mid, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| near-west area or middle-west area of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| I can go through the number of questions that Councilman Wallace had, which were very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| I thought, very germane to this that I could go through and answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| and then we could discuss this further, or I could open up to questions first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| How can we promise a $16 million pilot without seeing the scope of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| And this is, as we said back in our response to Councilman Wallace, this is a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| In most cases, you know exactly what the project is you're deferring on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| This is more tying it to concept and tying it to value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| and Tenova just isn't right now able to specify exactly what they want to do there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| though they do want to invest in health care in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| How can we promise a pilot unless the county approves it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Well, in this case, this isn't one of those situations that needs to involve county participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| because there's no retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| That's what's tied to the change in state law that you may have noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| has some of our pilots going to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Will the pilot simply expire at the end of 15 years? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| And I might add that this is on the tax rolls for a significant amount now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| and the city and the county will continue to get those property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Then what uses for the rear parcel or the other parcels on Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| Any plans for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| I could let Tenova answer what their plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| I don't think there are any specific plans for the remainder of that property left, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| I don't know if you want to address that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Another question, will Tenova have the right to sell the out parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| Will they have the ability to sell the parcel with the pilot in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| Lots of value there if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Basically, they will be there at the commencement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| Tenova must be there participating at the commencement of the pilot with a health care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| However, later if that pilot, if they wish to transfer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| we did not want to bind them there for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| There are too many complications and changes in ownership in the health care world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| It's very hard to put that requirement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| However, the requirement that it remain in health care is tied to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| So if that property were to be sold, it would have to stay in health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| or with the expiration of the pilot, the city and the county would receive full taxes immediately upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| So we're protected with the health care use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| and we're protected that Tenova will be there at least at the inception of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| And then the $16 million, where did COK come up with the $16 million for the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| That is a product of a series of discussions involving the purchase price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| and what we might cap the pilot for at that location to tie the health care use to the west area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3270)|
| 0:54:40| So we feel, I know some of you may feel like this is a rather strange looking package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| We think it's mutually beneficial to all parties, and it has a lot of benefits for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| not only ensuring continued health care presence on that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| but allowing us to not have any large cash outlay at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| to get a very important parcel of property that we can use in a series of valuable buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Of course, we're getting a series of buildings that are going to have to be taken down too, we realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| And it's beneficial, worked out to be beneficial for Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| as they pursue their plans for their future in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| So that's pretty well all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| I think I answered all those that George had sent, and we're open to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Thank you, Councilman Wallace. Any other comments? Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| So just to be clear, so if another company bought Tenova before any project started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| they would not get the benefit of the pilot, even if it was a health care development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| We're asking that the company that is now Tenova, and I don't know if Mark Mametoff needs to add any to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| but I don't know if Tenova were to be subsumed under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| I imagine the equivalent company getting it would qualify as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| but right now our understanding is Tenova will be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| and they will be the ones that will have a presence once this pilot begins after they construct this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Council, any other? Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| So at this point, Tenova does not have a definitive timeline to make a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| on when they would have some type of perspectives of what they intend to put on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| We just know that it will be some type of health care facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| but it sounds like Tenova does not have any solid plans at this point as it relates to what that facility would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| It will be health care, and we can let Tony speak to their general plans and timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| It is premature to be able to share specific timelines and details of the projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3405)|
| 0:56:55| but we do know from an economic development perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| that area is very important to further development for the Tenova health care system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| and that there are a number of health care related projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| We've looked at a number of plans and various different parcels on that land for health care related projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3429)|
| 0:57:19| Councilwoman Welch. Thank you, Vice Mayor, and before you leave, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| So you may or may not be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Whatever goes on this property, would it be in addition to the health care services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| that are currently being offered in our market by Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| or would health care services that are being offered in other parts of our community be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| I mean, obviously we know the hospital is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| so we know that there are some services that could potentially be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| but the Turkey Creek facility, the North Knoxville facility, would you move any services to this placement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| Sure. It's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| We've had to do a lot of work over the last year or so in basically realigning some of our services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| and for a number of reasons that we've talked about with the inefficiencies of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| it was just we were carrying a lot of losses in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| Freeing us from that and not having that operation, we're able to better reinvest in growing facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| so those would be new services that we would be providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| We've already started some reinvestment at North Knoxville and Turkey Creek Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| and getting those losses off the books allows us to do reinvestment into some newer services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| Okay. So we're not talking about closing aspects of anything other than what you've already announced closures for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Thank you, Mr. Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Before you step down, with this Middlebrook site, and I know it's very preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| and you don't have any plans as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| but are you envisioning maybe something that's a less intense use than the hospital would have been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| Is this more office-type appointments, that kind of a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| What is your vision at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Yeah, there are a couple different options that we are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| As far as the scale of a full replacement hospital, that's not anticipated at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| It would be a lesser impact project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| We do know that area is developed as a health care cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| There's a number of facilities in the Dow Springs area, and it would complement those types of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| One other quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Because the last time to know was before this body was about building this hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| can you take us through that decision of why that decision was made not to go forward with the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| and a little bit more about the potential plans for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| I would say the nature of how health care continues to evolve was part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| I know that was a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| It predates me a little bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| When we looked over the last year and a half to two years, we evaluated a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Could we reinvest in the current location at Physicians Regional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| Does a full replacement hospital make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| It didn't at the time, and as we look at the transition of how health care is delivered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| both in an inpatient setting versus an outpatient setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| it made more sense to develop more of our outpatient sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| and eliminate some duplication and reinvest in our North and Turkey Creek site for our inpatient services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Councilman Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Councilwoman Wilson, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| So this question is for Mr. Brace and Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| We have a lot of moving parts going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| So I don't know if I compare it to dominoes or a puzzle or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| but we have a science center in the site that's over where the current safety center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| We have, to note, the St. Mary's site and that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| We have this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| I'm just trying to get my mind around how all of this process is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| and how it all fits together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| We have management agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| We have development agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| We have pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| There are going to be multiple things that will be coming before council for our approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| and some of which are going to be dependent on our approval of other things, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| So I'd like a big picture of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| We're going to get into next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Now, let me say this, and I need to do this for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| It's been really nice to have Mr. Richters and the folks from Volkert here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| because what you just talked about is what keeps Dr. Lyons and I up at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| thinking about how the puzzle gets put together, because it is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| But we believe that that effort and the stress that comes with putting that puzzle together is worth it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| because of what we can do in an area where we're going to see some disinvestment in a vacant hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| So there are things happening in parallel, and so I've written down on the next steps sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| We obviously need to continue, and these are not sequential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| These will be happening at the same time, many of them, neighborhood outreach and dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| That includes getting with Deb Thomas, Oakwood-Lincoln Park, other leaders in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| We need to schedule a time for Knox Heritage and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| We need to set up a time for city council to tour the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| One very important step for Volkert is to secure the design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| so getting the licensed design professionals, architects, and engineers on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| that can really dive into the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Obviously, they will also continue to do site and project due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| so they're constantly honing these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| reviewing the environmental documents already provided by Realty Trust and by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| Do we need to go ahead and hire an environmental firm to help us flesh that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| We are continuing to explore partnership opportunities for potential urgent care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3814)|
| 1:03:42| Is there an economic development opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| I know the chamber wants to tour the Clark Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Are there other nonprofit opportunities on the campus that we could look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| There are some very complicated considerations that we need to work on with our attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| I saw Law Director Charles Swanson came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| so Mr. Swanson, Ms. Dyer from the City Law Department, along with Mark Mamentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| our outside counsel Greg Meadows is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| The hospital has a whole bunch of attorneys, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| Starting to dig into what the actual purchase agreement would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| and starting to put this into a time schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| One of the things Volcard is working on, one of their first 90-day tangibles, deliverables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| is a master project schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| I'm starting to look at that and look at what the timing would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| We're still very early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| I think assuming that we can work through all of these different tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| some type of consideration by council early spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| assuming that the neighborhood is supportive of this and city council bringing that before council for consideration in April or May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| some type of purchase and conveyance May or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| I want Volcard to have an interior demolition and a demolition package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| and an environmental remediation package ready so that when the conveyance happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| we hand that immediately over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| I don't want to be responsible for a portion of a vacant hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| Do we continue to have a maintenance and management agreement with Tenova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| That's in the LOI because we're not prepared to manage a facility we're not familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| So there are many puzzle pieces that have to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| I think that's why Dr. Lyons and I and others in this room will start to flesh out how we put the puzzle together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| But you're right, there are many things that we need to pull together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| Part of that will just be the transition in the interim from Tenova's leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| and having to, you know, what their needs are as the city comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| So there are a lot of handoff points both on the entire site that we're already in pretty significant discussions with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| A lot of that will be covered in the agreement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Did that answer your question, Councilman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Mostly. Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I don't think we've seen a development agreement on the science center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| So I think that's the other thing that to me I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I mean, I wouldn't want to sort of leave one vacant building in one part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| so that we can make sure to redevelop a vacant building in another part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| They're both important sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| So will we get an update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Actually, Dr. Lyons and I were with Mr. Clayton, Jim, this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| We actually went down and met with him and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| He is in the process of hiring a design professional to do the due diligence for the science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| We helped describe to Mr. Clayton, to Jim, what the scope of work would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| what we, the city, need to have to be able to approve adequately a review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| and hopefully approve the conceptual design, schematic design for the science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| And you're right, that development agreement has been out there for several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| Jim is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| He, again, wants to make the right decision on the design professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| that he will work with on this $100 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| And so I believe we're close, but I'll call Jim and see if I can get an update on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| I think we've known for a long time that we need new public safety facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| and pension and court and fire admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| So that's always been a driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| But you're right, the timing for how the museum and impacts on KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| I don't want to do a double move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| The police folks would not like me if that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| And so I want to keep them happy with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| And so we will continue to try to put those puzzle pieces together, Councilman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Got it. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I do have one more question, Vice Mayor, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| So there are several properties that aren't the current safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| So there are storage facilities that are being consolidated, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| I'm thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| But are there plans underway for what will happen with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| I don't know what all they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| but I know that there are several properties being consolidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Yeah, and so Deputy Chief Holliday, I think he will be in many ways the lead for KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| as we move into design, design development, and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| Part of, I believe, one of his tasks and Chief Thomas' task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| will be how we unwind either lease agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| And Chief Sharp, we have a lease for the spaces for KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| So looking at that with law, what are the lease terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| and keeping an eye out for how best to unwind those relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| and those agreements that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| I also think that the old Fifth Avenue facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| there may be some opportunities with Knox County Schools Facility Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| They're across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| and they're looking at how they could potentially consolidate their folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| So I've actually got a tour I'm setting up for Chris Caldwell and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| from the county to go over and just do a quick walkthrough of that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| to see if it would meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| So, yes, those are all puzzle pieces as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| I just, again, just abandoned buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| and I know this is something I think the city's done a really good job of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| of not leaving buildings vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| And so as things are consolidated, there will be vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| And thank you for thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| Just a quick refresher question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| Do we own the building where the pension board is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| That was actually many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| That was the Knoxville Utility Board's water facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| kind of the water department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| And so that was a hand-me-down, was Parks and Rec, was KPD Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| pension, and now it is KPD has an operation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| Animal Control, I believe, is still there, and pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| KPD does some storage there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Storage, animal control, and they've got some technology there, ICAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| And so there are operations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| But ideally, from a management perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| having that team under one umbrella, one modern facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| would be, I think, a benefit for KPD and Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| Other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| I have one more piece that I just failed to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| when we look at the opportunity here at Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| So when we look at the proximity to Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| I think there is a strong opportunity and desire with police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| to build that relationship with the students at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| Recruiting police officers, recruiting fire employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| even employees in the city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| So is that a way to recruit young people at an early time in their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| into those professions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| I think we definitely want to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I know the chief has a real strong interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| St. Mary's had a very long history in Tenova with that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| and we'd like to continue to build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| So I forgot to mention that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Thank you all for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Is there anything else you want to say before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| I'd like to add one thing we failed to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| This should be a real benefit to all the businesses along Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| and in the area and across the street on Woodland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| if you happen to be a new restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| and any number of things you might keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| because there's going to be a tremendous number of new customers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Council, do you have any further comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| We do have in public forum four folks signed up to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| The first is Donald Weiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Donald is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| If you would please give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| My name is Donald Weiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| I live at 1281 Aylor Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| If you would pull the mic down just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| I live at 1281 Aylor Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| I am a resident of the county, but I vote in the city by property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| I went on the police department in 1968 when it was in a horse stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| the old police department horse stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| I was there when they moved to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Now, the purpose of me being here today is we've got a golden opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| to get a veterans hospital here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| The representative of Duncan has us first on the list to get a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4367)|
| 1:12:55| There was some talk and negotiation, my understanding by some senators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4375)|
| 1:13:03| state senators and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| that St. Mary's was a possibility for us to use as a veterans hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| The metropolitan Knoxville area has 500,000 veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| Now, it's good, people, that we go out here and put wreaths on 10% of the veterans' graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| You know, Greenwood don't get any wreaths and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| But we need to do something for the living veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| I had a knee replacement, and of course I've got good insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| so a hospital won't benefit me personally, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| It won't do a thing for me because I already got good health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| and I used KOC and Tenova when I had my knee replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| But they told me to call or sent me to Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| and Johnson City said it was six months before I could get an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| But I went ahead, and KOC is my doctor, and they done my knee replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| I would like you to go down to Beale Town and just stroll through the lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| and see those poor people down there that don't have transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| that can't get to Johnson City, that can't get to Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| And these people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| So what I'm asking you to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| why is the urgency at the end of this administration to push this stuff through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| when this coming year is election year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| We've got Marshall Blackburn, we've got Roe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| we've got a whole lot of good federal officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| that would assist us in getting this hospital here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| We're competing against the whole nation to get a veterans hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| It's not just someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| And I would like to see it be in Knoxville more than I'd like to see it be in Blount County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| or Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| And for this area, look at the jobs that that would provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| with the staffing for all the doctors, nurses, maintenance people, security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| If you'll go down there, they have very good security at the veterans hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| So I won't belay you all anymore and take up your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| I'd just like you to consider the poor old veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| because everybody when they're running for election says, oh, I love you, I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| And of course, me, I was an old Navy man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| I was on the destroyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| I was in some good places like Beirut, Lebanon, and Tripoli, Libya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| I was up through the Black Sea, you know, the Russian flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| And I won the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| I swabbed decks at 8 o'clock in the morning and at 12 o'clock in the noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| and 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock and took the trash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| So I won the war by my efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| So I'm not saying that veterans are entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| but I'm saying veterans need to get what is promised to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| So I would like you to take that into your considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I know that it's not a big money deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| and it's not trying to put a hospital down on Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| that my neighbors all raised cane about here months ago and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| And like I say, I love these policemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| I was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| And I hope they stay working pending that pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| because I get a check from them every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| And I thank you, people, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you, Mr. Weiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| You all have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Next is Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| Once again, if you would give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Michelle Ivester, 1131 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| I'm the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association Vice President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| But tonight I'm here as a concerned neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| First and foremost, what was mainly concerning to me was the lack of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| and the transparency with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| We're a very active neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| and having to learn about this project via the media was very disappointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| and very disconcerting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| There are a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| A lot of people think I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| I'm really not against it, although after listening to the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| it still to me doesn't seem to be a very good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| It seems to be a very expensive project that I don't necessarily think it would benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4678)|
| 1:18:07| as tremendously as people would hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| I'm also concerned, even though I've been told numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| that there might be plans in the future for an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| I've been told numerous times that this isn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| If we could possibly get that in writing, I would feel much better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| because that's something that we don't need, especially across from a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| I was wondering why it hasn't been considered to be converted into affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4710)|
| 1:18:40| It seems to me that all of the rooms are currently set up with water, electricity, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| Could we not make that into some sort of an affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| It's desperately needed, especially with the group that was moved out from under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| They have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| But not only that, just in our neighborhood alone and in our city, we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| I'm very concerned also about the fact that demolition has been mentioned numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4744)|
| 1:19:12| I was happy to see that hopefully it will be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| I'm hoping that they will save as much as they can save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| Efforts will be made to salvage what isn't savable and reuse as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| As far as the green area and proposal for that, I would love to see a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| We've been promised a park for a few years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| It hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| That would be an excellent opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| I'm also concerned, I saw a story today before we came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| that there are doctors that are currently working there, but none of their patients are showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| They're canceling at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| And the reason that they're still there, even though the hospital is shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| is because apparently they're trapped into this lease for another six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| So if the city does decide to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| I would hope that you all would release them from their lease without any type of penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| or any type of negative impact on the doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| And that's about all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you, Ms. Habester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Next is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Keith, you know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| You've got up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Hi, Keith Britt, 558 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| I am 100% backing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| I think there's a big need there for the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| So I am very supportive of this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| There are some considerations I would just like to bring up that you may not have considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| The first and probably the most prominent is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| Just based on the map there, you can see that there's a choke point on Woodland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| You're going to have a lot of civilian, a lot of emergency services traffic moving through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| There's going to be conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I think part of this project needs to expand pedestrian walkways, maybe add some pedestrian bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| You can imagine a Friday night Fulton football game happening when there's an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4863)|
| 1:21:13| and there's a lot of police cars rushing out of there at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| I think there's some dangerous opportunities there that we need to kind of workshop before we make any firm plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| You're going to have 16, 17, 18-year-old drivers interacting with emergency traffic at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4886)|
| 1:21:35| Most of those people have never had to pull over for an emergency service vehicle before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| There's nowhere to pull over, even if they could, on some of these single-lane roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| I think we need to look at expanding some shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| I think we need to maybe look at some stoplight technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| I'd like to see police cars be able to egress from this site all the way to Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| with police department-controlled stoplights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| I don't know about that technology. I don't know how expensive that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| But it sure does seem like a necessary thing to get them out to service as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| It is going to be co-located with Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| If you look at shift schedules for the police department and school schedules, those overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| You're going to have massive flows of traffic overlapping on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| I'm not suggesting we change work schedules for the police department or change school schedules for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| We can design traffic flows so they don't conflict, and that should be part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| Public transportation. The sad fact is the people that will frequent this facility the most that don't work there are poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4961)|
| 1:22:51| We have very few public transportation options to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| I would like to see some type of public transportation enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| to make sure that people without a private vehicle can get there cheaply and quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| and they don't have to wait an hour to leave or go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Maybe expand cat trolley services up to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| As an Army veteran and as the husband of a police officer and a friend of a lot of police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=4995)|
| 1:23:25| there are security concerns with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| With the attack on Officer Hardin, with the attack on a police officer in Raleigh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| the attack on a police officer in Louisiana in the last few days, police ambushes are a thing that you need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| If that green section gets turned into a park, as was previously suggested, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| Big open areas are a nice buffer for a secure facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| But if we do have a lot of commercial entities adjoining to the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| that presents opportunities for danger for police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| Other than that, I do really support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| I don't see a lot of other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| The police department is out of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| If you tour the current police department, they are pressed in there like sardines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| They need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| I think this provides that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| And I don't see affordable housing, not to knock the previous speaker's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| I don't see affordable housing moving in here in any time or reasonable time span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Next is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5084)|

| 1:24:56| Deborah Thomas, 428 East Burwell Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| I'm just here to learn tonight, and I wanted to thank you for having the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| and bringing some of this stuff out into the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| And we look forward to working with council and Mr. Brace and Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| That's all of the public forum that has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5119)|

| 1:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190110?start=5131)|
