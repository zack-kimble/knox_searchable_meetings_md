| 0:02:38| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| We have one person signed up for public forum, Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=169)|
| 0:02:57| If you'd give your name and county of residence, please, and we'll hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| John Huber, Huber Properties, Knoxville, Tennessee, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Well, first off, thanks to all you guys for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| I mean, I know it's not for the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| But I just wanted to add a little color to this request, anyway, just from a personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| experience where I've been out and approached landowners who have property that's zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| CA or CB and wanted to build more of a residential product on it, apartments or something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| that, that would be very appropriate in that location, but our zoning code does not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| You know, because their fear is always that I would have to come in with a contract that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| said, hey, I like your property, but I want to down-zone it to another use, and they always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| are very resistant to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| So I think with our housing crunch that we've got, I think it would be a wonderful addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| a stopgap, if you will, until we can get to the new UDO, where I think all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| are going to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| But I think staff's done a great job, planning staff's done a great job in the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| It's my understanding that there was a lot of public input with some of the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Sounds like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| So I just wanted to, again, thank you and tell you I think it'll be a really good addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| and needed addition with our housing crunch right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Is there anyone else that is not signed up in the audience for public forum that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| I see no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Commissioners, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Well, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Could Knox Planning Director come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=279)|
| 0:04:50| Amy Brooks, Knox and North County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Director Brooks, can you kind of just give us a quick overview of how we got to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| point of a new ordinance here and what was some of the comments from the planning commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=300)|
| 0:05:09| So this originally stemmed from, if you all remember, it's been several years now, a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| years at least, the Alcoa Highway Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| So this was one of the recommendations that came out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| There was a request to better align the uses within the city with those in the county along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So there's kind of a mismatch in what's allowed in the zoning districts depending on the jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| And as you all know, along Alcoa Highway, it goes in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| And so again, so this originally stemmed from Alcoa Highway, that corridor plan, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| thought that we should take a broader look at the entire county, unincorporated area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| So the amendments before you do would apply countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Originally, the amendments were postponed to allow for additional comment and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| amongst interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| So we did meet with several property owners or their representatives, Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| and Public Works, some representatives from this body, as well as the planning advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| And so there were several meetings that took place over the course of the last year or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| And so again, in terms of comments from the planning commission, the planning commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| were very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| It allows for a transition from our corridors into our lower density areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| But also, you know, the idea to help relieve some of that development pressure in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| of our lower density areas by allowing a mix of uses along our corridors where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| already infrastructure to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| I'll answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| I do know that this did come partially, for sure, from the Alcoa Highway corridor where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=408)|
| 0:06:56| there were several, several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| I believe this ordinance will help Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Alcoa Highway corridor now is just a pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| So it does need more residential with shops that's beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| There's still, there's over 40 acres there that you really don't realize there's 40 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| there that can be really developed now with the passing of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| And there's some interest there, but they've been waiting, they've been waiting a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| So hopefully we'll get this passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I think it's a great thing for the Alcoa Highway, Alcoa Highway corridor, and I believe it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| be for the other corridors down around the Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| What's the one going east to west out of Powell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| Emory Road corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Is that the Emory Road corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| So I think it's a great, there was a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| I got to attend a few of the meetings and a lot of input from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Seeing none, I call this meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-public-meeting?start=490)|
