| 0:00:00| Welcome. Thank you all for coming out on this fine morning. We're here to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| welcome the next generation of leaders of the city of Knoxville. We're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=9)|
| 0:00:12| happy and excited about that. Before we go too far, I want to thank our musical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=12)|
| 0:00:19| folks in the back. It's a group called Allegro Con Brio, and I think that's even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=19)|
| 0:00:28| how it's pronounced. That was wonderful, and they look great. I love harps, so very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=28)|
| 0:00:35| excited about that. Again, thank you all for coming out today. This is not a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| for speeches, necessarily. This is a day about welcoming and honoring a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| generation of leaders of the city of Knoxville. Before I get our emcee up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| I just wanted to say one quick word about a vision I have. I have a picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| that somewhere in the next 5, 10, 15 years, Time magazine is going to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| story on the greatest cities in America, and I want to make sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Sunsphere is on the cover of that issue. I think what these five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| people up here, their minor challenge is to sort of make sure we do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| that the Sunsphere is really big on the cover and not something small in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| corner. The decisions that these five folks are going to be making, the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| decisions and the small decisions, are going to have a huge impact on that. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| that there's any pressure on them. We know this is a great city. We know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| that America should know how great this city is. I want to pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| real quickly before, again, we get the emcee up, and I want to thank people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| have done all the work to make sure that the Sunsphere gets on that cover, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| spent the last eight years making those hard decisions on a daily basis to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| us to where we are. We are saying goodbye today to really six people, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| name them all, and then I want to ask us all to do a round of applause for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| Bob Booker, Barbara Pelo, Joe Holquist, Steve Hall, Rob Frost, and Mark Brown have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| done a great job for this city for the last eight years and deserve our thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=135)|
| 0:02:35| We, I think I speak for the incoming and existing council members, actually we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| going to miss you folks. I want to bring our emcee up. We had to fish around for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| an emcee today. That's a hard job. We found one other person who's had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| little bit to do with how big the Sunsphere is on that cover of Time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| Magazine. I want you all to welcome the mayor of Knoxville, Mr. Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you, and thank you, Bob. This is a great day, and I am thrilled that so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=182)|
| 0:03:12| people came out. There should be a great crowd here because this is an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| day. A lot of you in the crowd worked hard to have the people behind me be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| able to sit behind me right now. A lot of you called friends and worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| knocked on doors, and did a lot to make certain it happens, and so I'm, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| we're all really pleased that you had come. I want to recognize some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| elected officials. Bob recognized our retiring council members, and he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| They have done an outstanding job for the city, and all of us are grateful for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| everything you've done. We're not quite used to seeing Mark Brown up here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| judges robes. I'm not certain that that's a new one for us, but I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| recognize a few folks. I know I saw Representative Joe Armstrong walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Joe, thank you very much. I was scribbling notes, so these are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| the order that I saw them, so if I missed somebody, forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| From County Commission, we have the Chairman Tank Strickland, Finn Bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Saunders, and Ed Schaus, and if I missed somebody, let me know. We have our clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| Foster Arnett. Foster, thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| Sam Anderson from school board is with us. Sam, thanks. Representative Ryan Haynes is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=254)|
| 0:04:22| here as well. Ryan, thank you for coming, and we have former council member Gene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| Teague is here, I know, and former Vice Mayor Jack Sharp, so thank you all very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| much for coming. Well, it is my privilege to be the emcee today, and like I said, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| am thrilled that we're here. I'd now like to ask the Reverend Christopher Battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| from Tabernacle Baptist Church to come and give us the invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=282)|
| 0:04:51| The psalmist says, unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain that build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| it. Unless the Lord builds the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain. Won't you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| bow with me? Heavenly Father, for the joy and significance of this occasion, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| invite your presence, not only for this day, but throughout the tenure of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| administration. Guide and bless these men and women who have been sent here by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| people of the city of Knoxville, and we pray that they have been ordained by your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| hand to govern this city. We pray that decisions would be made for the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| of your people, and not for personal gain, power, or endorsement. Grant them your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| wisdom to rule. May their decisions direct us to the center of your will. Give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| them clear minds to govern this city, accomplish your goals, and to serve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| fellow man. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| Thank you. I'd now like to ask the color guard from the Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Department. Hopefully, they're outside. If they would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| Oh, they're over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=374)|
| 0:07:50| Now, I'd like to ask the Assembled City Council behind me to lead us in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=470)|
| 0:07:59| Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=482)|
| 0:08:17| Michael Rodgers will now sing the National Anthem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=502)|
| 0:08:51| twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=531)|
| 0:09:09| O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=549)|
| 0:09:35| Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=575)|
| 0:10:04| O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=604)|
| 0:10:23| The National Anthem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=623)|
| 0:10:53| Please be seated and join me in thanking the Knoxville Police Department Color Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=653)|
| 0:11:23| I don't know if you heard in Vice Mayor Becker's introduction, but even though it says remarks, Bill Haslam, in the introduction he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| this is not a day for speeches, so I think he had a slight message in there for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| I really do want to make just three short points, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| I want to congratulate the five new members of council sitting behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| There's other people that have run for office and elected officials here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Until it's been you who's knocked on those doors and made those phone calls and walked through those neighborhoods and talked to those coffee groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| and spoke at all those meetings and then sat or stood with a lot of your friends one anxious night listening to the radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| or watching the bottom of the TV screen feed to see how it came out, it's hard to understand what it's like to put yourself up for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| But unless great people continue to do that, we won't continue to have good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| So I'm very grateful for the fact that we had such an outstanding group of people being willing to go through the process of being elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| and being willing to serve because it does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| It matters who governs, and I'm grateful for your willingness to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Secondly, I would like to say you've chosen well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Being in local government is a great privilege where you can make an incredible difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| And I think if you look at the retiring members before you, they would all say there is a huge satisfaction in being able to change your city for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| You have chosen well, and this is a hands-on job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| I tell people that because it's a job you can wrap your arms around and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Now, people can also get their hands on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| So if you don't like that, you might think about it before you take this oath because they will be grabbing you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| as the retiring members can tell you, at church and at the grocery store and at Little League baseball games and everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| But it is a wonderful thing that you have chosen to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| And the third thing is that you've taken on a very serious obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| Government at all levels, national, state and local, is under, really, pressure that we haven't seen in a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| due to the revenue and the fiscal crisis that's affecting families and businesses affects government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| And there will be plenty of hard choices to make down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| So you've taken on a job that is a very noble one, but also will be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| And we are grateful to have your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| So was that short enough, Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Now I would like to do what we really are here to do, and that is to swear in each of the new council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| Each of them has asked someone to administer the oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| First will be the new representative from the First District, the Honorable Nick Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| His oath will be administered by the Honorable John Rawson, the municipal judge for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=834)|
| 0:14:07| I, Nick Pavlis, do solemnly swear that I will support, defend and abide by the Constitution of the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=847)|
| 0:14:20| the Constitution of the state of Tennessee, and the charter and ordinances of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| and that I possess all the qualifications required by the charter and ordinances of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=869)|
| 0:14:39| or by general law, for the office that I am about to assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| and that I will discharge my duties as city council member faithfully, honestly and impartially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=886)|
| 0:14:56| So help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=899)|
| 0:15:09| In case you're wondering, it does take about three times as many words to become a city councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| as it does to become the President of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| And we've shortened it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Next, the new representative from the Second District, the Honorable Duane Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| His oath will also be administered by Judge Rawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=921)|
| 0:15:35| Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I, Duane Grieve, do solemnly swear that I will support, defend and abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| that I will support, defend and abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| by the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| by the Constitution of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| the Constitution of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| the Constitution of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| and the charter and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| and the charter and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| and that I possess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilswearingin091219?start=961)|
