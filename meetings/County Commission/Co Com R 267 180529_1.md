| 2:43:45| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| Mr. Gilreath, would you come to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9827)|
| 2:44:07| I'm actually representing Mr. Gilreath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| My name is Charlie Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| You look familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| 1028 Lancewood Drive, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| I had a couple calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| The main concern was that will you do a buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9861)|
| 2:44:27| make sure that there's a landscape feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| maybe trees of some type that separates the Burnet Creek condo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| I guess you'd call it the pods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| Will you keep that barrier there or plant some more trees there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| We'll definitely keep the barrier there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| We're in the planning stage right now, but we haven't finalized our plans yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| You know, that's the only consideration I would hope that you consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| The neighbors there that lives there, there's probably 80, 90 homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| So please keep that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| Yes, sir, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Motion to approve recommendation by MPC to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9898)|
| 2:45:06| Planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| Planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| Sir, planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| What kind of commercial development are you proposing for this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| Well, we're thinking a combination of storage units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| with outdoor storage as well to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| But, again, that's what we're considering at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| And then how much is there a community pool covers the 7.2 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9929)|
| 2:45:35| There was a community pool there at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| It has since been filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| I couldn't find it on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9939)|
| 2:45:40| That's why I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Existing land use is not really a community pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| Well, it used to be Chapman Community Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| It's been out there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| I just want to add that Chapman Recreation Pool there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| I was a lifeguard there when I was 16, 17 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| So I'm really disappointed it's torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| It's torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| I remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| Just for a little bit of an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| we have been doing a John Sevier Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| And that part is under the Scenic Parkway, correct, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9978)|
| 2:46:24| And that's got some regulations on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| And if you would be considerate about the signage also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9986)|
| 2:46:30| be considerate to the neighbors and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| So I'd appreciate that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| I meant to mention that and I forgot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9995)|

| 2:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9999)|
| 2:46:40| I believe we have a motion and a second before us to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10000)|

| 2:48:22| It's nowhere near the Pedigo part of Greenwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10102)|

| 2:50:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| I want to make a motion that we approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10227)|
| 2:50:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| I'm going to vote for approval on this, but I just had a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| I went out there and drove past the property yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| Are you going to be able to work with the guy who's got the donkeys on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| Actually, the whole reason, it was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| I don't know how many of you were at that meeting in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| The whole reason we're dividing it into three parcels is so that we are going to sell the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10256)|
| 2:51:02| We've got a square parcel down at that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| We're going to cut that corner off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| Then there's going to be our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| We're going to actually hold on to that acre, and we're going to let him continue to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| Just out of the art, we're Christians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| He's Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10273)|
| 2:51:14| We're just, if it don't cost us anything, we can help somebody, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| So that's why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| We could only divide it into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| We have to sell this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10281)|
| 2:51:22| We got into more than we bargained for with this house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| and we need to sell and cash out and just move on and not talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| But we're doing this to help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| So it was just baffling the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| But at any rate, yes, to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| It sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10295)|
| 2:51:36| The three donkeys appear to be in good health and happy when I saw them yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10299)|
| 2:51:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10300)|
| 2:51:41| Commissioner Dowd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| I don't know if I can talk to donkeys or not, but, Amy, is there sewer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10302)|
| 2:51:50| Is there sewer available that's going from agricultural to RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| There is sewer there, but I've also been told that, hey, sometimes they say there's sewer and there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10313)|
| 2:51:59| So I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10319)|
| 2:52:00| But I'm paying Halsedale Powell sewer, and the sellers, when they conveyed the property in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10320)|
| 2:52:06| they did say it was sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| So to my knowledge, it's got sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| So you understand that if we rezone it and it's not, you only can build one per acre without the sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| Or incur the cost of Halsedale Powell running the pipes correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10337)|
| 2:52:21| As long as you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| And they were down there playing with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| Just if you guys have been out there, it is a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| So I don't know what they're doing, but I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| I'm not worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| I'll cross that bridge, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10349)|
| 2:52:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| So we have a motion to approve per MPC recommendation and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10358)|

| 2:53:04| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| May we get the report from MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| MPC is recommending that Knox County Commission approve a agriculture by-vote of 11-0-2 on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10389)|

| 2:53:50| I just wanted to ask Ms. Brooks a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| How long have you been the planning services manager for MPC now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10433)|
| 2:53:59| Since I believe September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10444)|

| 2:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10446)|
| 2:54:07| Are you enjoying it still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| That was the best answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| What did you expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for explaining the schools because we see these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10456)|
| 2:54:21| And it's good to know in the future that we could look at these MPC numbers and know that they're going to be close to accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10461)|
| 2:54:27| And to me that's very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| So I appreciate that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10472)|
| 2:54:33| Russ sat down and he tried to explain the algorithm that they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10473)|
| 2:54:39| But he has done follow-up years later to see how it actually played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10479)|
| 2:54:45| And he was quite impressed at how accurate it had turned out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10485)|
| 2:54:52| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| We've got some more in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| I just wonder if they came to just see the show or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10496)|
| 2:55:04| Would you all like to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10504)|
| 2:55:07| Would you like to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10507)|
| 2:55:08| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| Well, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| And we've got some more down here that I don't know if the chairman can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| I can't see now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| What were you here for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| Maybe that's the best question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| We're looking for the road projects off East Emory around 1,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10519)|
| 2:55:27| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Why don't you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| Please come to the podium and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10529)|
| 2:55:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| I'm Glenda Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10541)|
| 2:55:42| And I am here for my in-laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| My address is 6948 Beeler Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| And they live on the property of 4901 East Emory Road, 38 is the zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10548)|
| 2:55:54| And they were just addressed, and we were told we needed to be here to get some answers in reference to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10554)|
| 2:56:01| that's going to be widened out in front of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10561)|
| 2:56:08| And apparently they have come to them saying that I guess they're going to acquire their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10568)|
| 2:56:16| And their question is, you know, just trying to get some input, you know, what are we looking at, time length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| how does the process work when it comes to the money value, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| what is it that we need to do to get things prepared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10591)|
| 2:56:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10592)|
| 2:56:33| Are you speaking of Emory Road between Halls and Harbinson's Crossroads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10601)|
| 2:56:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10602)|
| 2:56:43| That is a state highway and is a part of the Improve Act that the state legislature passed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10603)|
| 2:56:53| That section of Emory Road is in that bill to be approved, to be improved to a four-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| And that's a state undertaking, not a county undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| It's sort of like Halls to the interstate was the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| Yeah, I should have thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=10634)|
