| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=0)|
| 0:00:31| All right, that's item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| Now we're going to do item four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=35)|
| 0:00:37| Discussion of numbering all GINA items on the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| I think it's a whole lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Drew, can you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| It's not really something that's going to be a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| I know the workshop agenda is numbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=50)|
| 0:00:53| but then we don't have it numbered on the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| And I have gotten calls wanting to talk about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| and it would be a lot easier if they were numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| So we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| I don't think we'd have to have a rules change to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| All right, item number five, discussion of the agenda deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| This is one that says that the agenda deadline is the first Monday at 12 noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| and that any agenda item may be added by the chairman after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| I kind of get aggravated, and I'll use the word aggravated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| that we get this information 15 minutes before we vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| or we get it the week of, the Monday of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| I know at BZA, when I served on BZA, we had a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| If you didn't meet that deadline, you waited until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| And I'd just like to have an open discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| see how anybody feels that we need a hard deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| or what we should do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Well, I have been chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| I think there's backing yourself into a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| I mean, I know we've got the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| but backing yourself into a corner that it cuts it off completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| it can mean a loss of grant funding down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| if an application is a little bit late and it doesn't make the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| There's those mistakes that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Now, don't get me wrong, there's some neglect on some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| When I was the chairman, I always told the folks that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| preference is for you to have it in the Thursday before the work session, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| if you've got something that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| But I think backing yourself into a corner and saying nothing is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| even by the chairman, could cause you to lose some funding down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| that you've got, you know, CDGB funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Sometimes those things are late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| It's just don't pin yourself where you can't facilitate government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| And I know it's frustrating at times, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| we've delayed things for a month here and there when it is frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| but I think backing yourself into a corner is a bad idea having been the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=185)|
| 0:03:13| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| So aside from the community development block grant monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| that potentially have a fiscal impact, what other issues would back us into a corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=208)|
| 0:03:36| I mean, you can have a contract that's going to be let and just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| the law department has some issues with it and it doesn't get back from their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| I mean, you can just hold up progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| and sometimes it's not necessary to hold that progress up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Sometimes it's benign to the point where it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| And if you hold up progress, you're simply just holding up progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| So is that discretion at the discretion of the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| or are we looking at full commission issues that we really need to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| before making a decision on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| That's what I'm a little confused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| But sometimes we get information that we haven't read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| and how do you then balance information you need to make a decision on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| without benefit of study or asking appropriate questions about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Most of those times we'll wait a month on that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| I think there's some benign stuff that you don't want to shut the door on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| The commission itself can by two-thirds majority add an item at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| So we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| There's a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| My main concern was the zoning that we had last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| where it started out at $200,000, then it went to $240,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| and it ended up five minutes beforehand it was $265,000 or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| And the contract was promised to us a week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| It showed up 15 minutes before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| That's not enough time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| We don't have to have a rule or deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| I can make a motion that it be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| And whoever's brought it before us, and if we get six votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| it's going to be postponed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| So that's the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I just wanted to bring forth just to let people get it out in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| and let people know that if you're coming maybe in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and you don't have your ducks in a row, that's not my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| You need to have your ducks in a row to present to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| so we can make it sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| I thought I was voting on $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| It ended up time to vote, and it was $265,000 or $280,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| I can't remember what that number was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| We was going to time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| And to me that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| The only thing they changed on that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| was the facilitation of the payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| It wasn't the number didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| It was the facilitation of that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I was told personally that they were going to spend $220,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| to do the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| We can leave that at is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| It's just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| I don't think that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| We've got rules here set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Each commissioner might need to look at their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| if it's in their district, how to proceed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Is there nothing set in place right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| If that kind of issue comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| something that we really need to take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| is there some way that we suspend the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| of the commission for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| say take a 10 or 15 minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| and so we can take a look at it and then discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| We do have a way of looking at these pieces of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| that we need to really read a little bit about it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Is that not set in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| No, you can take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| Yeah, just don't go in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| All right, anyone, any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| So we do have provisions already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| The chair can add an item to agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| and the whole commission by two-thirds of vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| can add an item to agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| And each commissioner can make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| for whatever length of period of time they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| So there is areas in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Item six is really an ethics issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| It's not really a rules committee issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| I have been in discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| with a couple of our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| about looking at our ethics rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| and one of them is the changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| to meet their $50 per, I guess, meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| entertainment voucher, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| The state has set a $50 minimum hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| It's been $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Jill, do you know how long that has been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| 2007, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| So usually if you're invited to an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| it's usually $50 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| It's not $35 anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Very seldom will you see any event that's $30 or $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| So usually it's $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| I brought this up as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| It will have to be brought forth to change the ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| It will have to be brought forth through a resolution, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=529)|
| 0:08:58| So I'd just like to open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| If anybody has a comment, they can comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| or we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I'd like to just have some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| to what entertainment means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| because I can get an invitation to the symphony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| or an invitation to the opera ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| So when we speak of entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| or entertainment to a concert past that $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| we're lumping all of those under entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| because I like to attend big ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| but the tickets to the big ears is $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| So entertainment beyond just clarifying what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| do we assume people understand entertainment is music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| general sport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| So that would be the bicycle race that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Do we need clarification of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| or are we just still saying entertainment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Like Clarence Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| they send you complimentary two free tickets to every opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Clarence Brown, well, if you go on opening night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| it's $40 a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| And so what we do is we do a $50 donation as a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| to cover any overages over $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Even at $50, it won't get you in big ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I'm looking for somebody big ears tickets over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| All right, I think it's, me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| it's, you know, we as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| we're invited to a lot of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| and $35 is not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| $50 is not too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| So I will get with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| and see what we might need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| bring it before the whole commission as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| Commissioner Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Well, we get invitations to everything that we're invited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| but we don't, they're not giving us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| they're not giving us a complimentary ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Everything that I've gone to that if it's $100 a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| it comes out of my personal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| So are you all getting invited to a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| that you're getting complimentary because I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Well, Clarence Brown is complimentary, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| those are value to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Yeah, but I mean, we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| are you all getting really that many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| to where you're given a free ticket to get in, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| I mean, we get invited, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| The chamber event, the Pilon-Eaton politicking is $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| So that's the cost per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| So, I mean, it's just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| there's all kinds of those little things that you get invited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| that if it's under $35, you don't have to pay for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| if it's a comp ticket, but if it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| if it's over $35, you got to pay the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Okay, so here would be an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| The 40th anniversary gala of the Knoxville Opera ticket was $108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=728)|
| 0:12:17| They sent an invitation to me to contact the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| would you like to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| I purchased my ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| I mean, I've been a long-term supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So I bought my ticket, and I bought my husband's ticket to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| But the value of that ticket is $108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| So you could have got it for $73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Theoretically, to stay in ethics rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| So that invitation then had to, it's beyond $35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| and you're saying pay the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| I paid just the amount of the ticket value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Right, however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| They sent me an invitation saying these tickets were complimentary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| but that's beyond what our amount was, and I bought my ticket to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| That's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Yeah, we have, I've been invited a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| I think the Metropolitan Drug Coalition's Thursday, lunch is Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| and we've been invited to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| You know, we go there, do we donate the $50, or do we donate $35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| or do we take it as a complimentary ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| That's a legislative launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| The value is probably $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Well, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| That's not a fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Yeah, we're not charging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| That's not a $50 ticket or a $35 ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| That's a legislative launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| The Metropolitan Drug Coalition is sitting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| There's no charge to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| And certainly you can always, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| we would never turn down a donation to Metro Drug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| but there is no charge for tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| So the meal is like $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Yeah, just put ABC Company in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I said the NBC, but just ABC Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Chairman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Are you going to write this to where it singles out county commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Because if not, you need to get with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| because it's going to affect the whole employee base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| I'll get with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I will personally get with the law department and see what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| if we need to pursue this and how to pursue it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| and then with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| And it's, to me, jumping for the $50 from $35 is not extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| If it was $75, I would say, you know, we need to stop it, or $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| We need to stop and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| But since that's been 10 years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| the economy's changed in 10 years, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| I just want to know what this entry is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| I have the priority to recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Well, it seems like if the state of Tennessee does their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| and has come to a $50 amount for all of their state employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| it would seem to me that, you know, the state is pretty darn frugal on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| that they wouldn't just throw out a number to throw out a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| because it just seems like we ought to bring it up to the same level as the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| I didn't think the state had a, I thought they had a zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| unless they bought it for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| I thought it was zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| No, it's $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I've got, I apologize, I left that piece of paper at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| But it is $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I've been in discussions with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And it's actually $50 two different times for a max of $100 that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| So they could go to a breakfast and then at evening go to a luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| or dinner that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| But it can't be with the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| It has to be two different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Let's move on then to item number seven, if I'm not correct, if I am correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| I have been approached, and for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| I have not been approached by any county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| I was approached to look at changing the meeting times back to 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| whatever that time may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| I know that it would help the, I'm going to call it Nosh County Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| it would help the associates during the daytime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| that they don't have to be here until, you know, 6.30, 7.00, 8.00, 9.00,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| So I wanted to bring this before this rules committee for any type of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| that one way or the other they feel like we need to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| with the full commissioner or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Well, I think historically, if you go back and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| I was against moving it from 2 o'clock to 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| just because I felt like we were changing it just to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| But I think that moving this meeting every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| can give the perception to the public that we're trying to move things around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| to confuse people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Also, I think that there's value in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| and I know it affects, you know, some of the directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| and some of our support team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| but there's value in having a larger pool of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| that are eligible to run for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| You know, if you have to be here at 2 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| there's some people that are just eliminated from being a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| just due to that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Everybody that may have business, don't want to discuss contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| don't want to discuss zonings or whatever they want to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| those folks, the majority of them work Monday through Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| 8 to 5, 8 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| So why would we go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I'm against it for the simple fact that we're doing it every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I think it's the right thing to do to keep it to where it's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| although it's an inconvenience to some of our support team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| I mean, it's the right thing to do to do the people's business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| so that people have the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| And on the flip side, to have a bigger talent candidate pool for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| our future commissioners to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I'd like to echo what Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| but I also want to add the component about how would people access this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| It is very difficult for people to come here and park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I mean, parking is no longer accessible in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| You need to be in a public garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Then you need to come over here to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| I appreciate the time at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| so the public can be engaged even after you work a full day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| I think it is very significant to make sure people have access to what the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| of the commission does as well as having the capacity to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| because at 5 o'clock your public garages are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| It's easier for people to have access to the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and I certainly believe that your potential candidate pool serves best at 5 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| and not at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| The reason I chose to run for county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| was because the commission meetings were moved to 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| because I had a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| I can see our candidate pool being enlarged by having evening meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| I'll be here at 6 a.m. or 11 midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| It doesn't matter to me, because that's what I committed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I can see that is the main reason I see for leaving it as a candidate pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| for county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| But as we all notice, we've not had that meeting during the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| At our commission meetings, there's not that many come and discuss agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| So I don't know if we're really serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| If we went there to serve that purpose, that purpose is not being met at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| I'm not saying next month we'll have a crowd here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| I went through two budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| and there was no one really here to discuss the budgets during that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| Chairman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| The point is not how many people are showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| It's the fact that we're giving them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| and providing them with the accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| If people don't want to come and be engaged in their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I don't want it to be said that we are keeping them from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| It would be on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I don't think we need a motion to proceed or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| We'll just say right now it was brought before the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| and I don't see anybody really in favor, so we'll just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| Item 8, discussion to move the school agenda items to the end of the agenda under Item K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| which will be a new letter with separate consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| I was approached also that we have schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| The school agenda items are always first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| It is a consent, basically a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| We cannot change funding at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| I was requested to ask about moving it to the back of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| and maybe with a different consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| and move regular county business like public engineering, mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| health department up to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| So I'm bringing that forth here for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| The problem with doing that is that the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| on some Mondays that we have work session or commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| the school board is meeting and they can't come and answer our questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| if they're on both agendas on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| I noticed that, but I think, no, it's Matt Myers back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| I thought I seen the superintendent, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| They've been here for the whole meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| They're good about sitting here for the whole meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| You know, the comment was made that it's always been done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Schools has always been first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Schools don't always have to be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| I mean, that's just, you know, we can change if we need to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| if we think that it needs to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| that we move the regular county business before the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| You know, me personally, I see nothing wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Moving regular county business with the school agenda being item K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| Commissioner, I mean, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Just call me Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| How much time do you think this is going to save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| Well, the people that are sitting there that's waiting in public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and engineering, like last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| it probably could save them 30, 40 minutes or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Doesn't it just take the time that it takes to read the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| I'm still taking on, we're talking about today, like on workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| all school items are first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| And that could be a long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Then, like last month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Commissioner Anders asked some questions about the Carnes building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| which took some time, but we really couldn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| All we can do is ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| We can't withhold money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| We can't change a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| That's not in our purview to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| And so I'm saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| that needs to be at the back of the agenda for discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| I would like to point out something to all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| that these people that are here from the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| this is not the only meeting they have to attend each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| They have three other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I think we've always done it as a courtesy to get them out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| They usually stay until the consent's read and then they leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| unless something's going to come up in public forum or discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| I think we've done it out of convenience for them because we know they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| have three other meetings that are going to keep them away from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| families three more times that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Well, I like, me personally, I still like to see it moved to item K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| make a new item K for four schools, the school agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| But I would need a motion for that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| and I don't think I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| You can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Chair can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I'd like to make a motion that we bring forward the commission moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| schools to, at the back of the commission workshop and commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| adding an item K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| We do have a second by Chairman Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| So we do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| So next, are there any discussions on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Mr. Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| How would we do things that are pulled off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Where would they put them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Something that's on the school consent agenda or something that's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| school agenda that were pulled off of consent to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| where would we move that to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| That would be at item K at that same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| You know, we can pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| We'd have two consent agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| One will be for our regular public works, engineering, and all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| And after all that business is said and done, we go into schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| they can pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| If we're having to set another consent agenda at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| if one needs to be pulled off, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| If it will be read in the record, then we're off and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Clarify that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| So we will have a consent agenda specific to schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| That's what I just need to offer some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| And then we're moving the regular agenda items of commission business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| ahead of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| And then if I need to pull something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| that will be reflective of the first consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Not for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Not for schools, but for commission business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| For regular commission business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I just need to offer some clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| I don't think we'll have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| We've done this in the past where something comes up here and we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| could we move this to the front of the agenda to take care of this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| and go ahead and address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| So if we have some situations that comes up with the schools that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| need to leave early and they want to talk about a certain issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| we can always take those and move those to the front of the agenda if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| they ask for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| We have that ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| I will speak to Superintendent Thomas also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| I've not spoken to him about this issue to get his feelings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| So, Chairman Randy, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Light's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I do that a lot too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| So we do have a motion to move to an item K for the schools and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| I hear a vote for you to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| Yay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| All in favor, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Two ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| We have three ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| No roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I'll vote yes to move it on to the full commission and let everybody vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| Commissioner Carringer votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Commissioner Bussler votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Commissioner Daly votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| I'm not sure exactly what changes we might have to change in the rules to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| So do you all want to look at those changes before we send them to the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| or are we supposed to add them to December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| We're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| No, this is not something I would add for December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| I would like to meet with the Superintendent Thomas and discuss, get his feelings of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| We can do it as a discussion item next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| They just voted to bring it before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| It's an agenda item for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| We've got to get the bugs worked out before they set the agenda of the next commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Well, the answer is no, we will not have it before next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| So we will probably, it sounds like we may have another rules committee meeting before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| We just voted to send it to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| So we'll discuss that commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| What Jill's asking is you voted to do something, we'll have to look through the rules and amend them accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1778)|
| 0:29:46| to achieve what they voted and have something for commission to vote on a resolution at the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| That's all she was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| But we can defer it for 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| After we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| You all can vote on anything you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| I'm just saying right now we have a resolution that will have to be prepared to go before commission as a recommendation of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Then we can defer if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Item 10 or item 9, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Discussion to add public forum to the work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| We do not have a public forum for the work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| I don't know if we necessarily need one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| That was requested at the last week's CTAS meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| I did the interview with quite a few county commissioners and mostly local, Anderson Blount, surrounding Campbell counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| It's unusual, I like the way they did this, is that Anderson County has a public forum for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| If it's a group of people, their max is 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| If an issue comes before them that they think that is urgent or needs to be reviewed, they set up a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| That committee looks at that issue from the public forum and brings it forth, see if it can be brought forth before the whole committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| That's something we may not want to do as far as that part of it, but it was unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| But each county commission does have a public forum, and most of those are, everybody kept saying three minutes, and ours is five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| I think ours was caused for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| The question is, we do not have a public forum for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| Do we see the necessity of having one or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| I like the public ought to be able to speak at every meeting we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| Everybody agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I'll make a motion that we add section C and M on work session agenda for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1920)|
| 0:32:14| Excuse me, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Are we going to set the same type of rules we have for the regular meeting as we do for this forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1936)|
| 0:32:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| So you might, in the rules, you have a paragraph regarding public forum and you also have a paragraph regarding work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| So do you want to put that in one of those two sections regarding public forum for the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| I believe the work session and the regular commission meeting public forum should be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| The same rules, five minutes, whatever those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| We just need to make sure that we're following the same procedure for both meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| So I will just, I might put something in both the section on the public forum and also on the work session section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| We did have a, we're not voting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| 443, let's go to item 11 is a discussion of having a sign up sheet for public forum with the speaker's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2002)|
| 0:33:32| correct pronunciation, address of the speaker, and agenda item or topic that they wish to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| I don't think you need a rule for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I think you just design it with Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| There's something in your rules already that has the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I can't hear you, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| There is something in the rules that already has the speaker's name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| It doesn't have the sign up sheet or the pronunciation or the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| The reason this was brought before me was that it would be easier on the chair to know who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| the topic they're going to speak on, and if it's going to be a topic of an agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| which the chair already has, if it's already one of the agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| they can speak at that point in time or they can speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| That was just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| A lot of times I cannot pronounce people's names, and it would be nice to have it if they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2067)|
| 0:34:36| Drew, is that something that you can kind of design for us and have a sign up sheet and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| or do we already have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I can design one, but I'm not sure how we're supposed to get the pronunciation written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I don't know how to write someone's name and pronunciation written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| I don't think the pronunciation is as important as the correct spelling and the address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| because the clerks need the address anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| If we do this, we would need to have a way of letting all the public know when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| if they are wanting to speak, who and where to sign to expect them to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| I don't think it's that convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| It probably needs to be more somebody out there when they come in the main door over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| Gustin will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| I'm not mistaken, the city council has a sign up sheet that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and it's usually right there on the corner of the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| That is not a rules committee thing, so any more discussion on that, we will look at doing that, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| Are you talking about this is the sentence here now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Do you want to change the sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Citizens appearing before the commission shall state their name and residential address or business address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2153)|
| 0:36:09| I don't think we want to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| We just want to make sure that when someone comes in and they want to be able to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| we have a sign up sheet down front with their name, their address and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| so they will not be missed, and it will help give a little bit of heads up to the commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| Is that something that you would want whoever, our chairman or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| to announce when we start the meeting that if they're here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| they need to make sure that they've signed up on that sheet so that everybody's aware of how to get up there or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2200)|
| 0:36:50| My understanding is that right now, someone will call in to be on public forum, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2210)|
| 0:37:00| That's the only way that I know of now, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| that unless they come in and say, hey, I'm here to be, that's where the sign up sheet should come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| We should have a record of who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Where that's going to be placed, we can do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| We can figure out where that sign up sheet is going to be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Jill is asking, do we need to have in our committee rules stating that there will be a sign up sheet for name, address, all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2237)|
| 0:37:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Is that necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| I don't think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| And were we reading from page two under section B that said speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Is that the reference we were trying to clarify here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Page eight, section O in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| I wasn't sure if we were looking at that section here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Hey, let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Page 10, did we miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Yeah, because there was a different reference to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Then we went to 11, did we miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| That's the reason why I'm trying to figure out where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| I don't know if you want to go back or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| We need to change it there that we have the workshop and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| Yeah, we're going to do that, but it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| One last topic before we're going to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| I did miss 10, so let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| We just did 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Going back to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Discussion of necessity to have public forum at the beginning and the end of the commission agenda, items C and M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| We do have two public forums at the beginning and at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| I don't know if we had too many at the end since I've been the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| It was placed in there, historically placed in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| so that those that came in late to a meeting could have an opportunity to speak if they so chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I can't remember more than a couple of times that it's been taken advantage of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| but again, like Randy said a while ago, it's not about the quantity of people that have showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| It's the opportunity for them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| So I think it's a good thing to have both of them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| I did not know the reason, and that sounds perfectly where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| I have no problem leaving it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| All right, we've got one last agenda item, and I'll hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| Item 12, discussion regarding questions at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| Last month's public forum, there was a speaker there, and there was questions asked of that speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| Prior to that, there was a public forum, and the speaker asked questions of myself and Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| I asked the law director, and he said we need to take a look at it, so I went and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| Under public forum, there's no rules on about whether we ask them questions or they ask us questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2395)|
| 0:40:07| All I'm asking is at public forum, as commissioners, do we want to be able to ask questions of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| and does the public speaker have the right to ask questions of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| Chairman Bussler, I mean, Vice Chairman Bussler, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| It's Charlie, but anyway, I think they have the right to question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| That is a public forum, but we don't need to get into really having a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| If you have a question, you answer it, and that's it, but don't debate an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| If they're doing an issue kind of soliloquy out there about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| I don't think that we need to, like I say, do a public debate, but I think questions we could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| I do, and I'll throw up one like 287G, which Commissioner Gill and I were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| We have no control over that, so we really can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| I guess our response is that is out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| I think with professional courtesy, if you need a clarifying statement or question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113RulesCommitteec?start=2483)|
