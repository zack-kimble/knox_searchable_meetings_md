| 2:47:49| It was not just an idle decision that, oh, let's go ahead and vote to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| Okay, boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| I'm going to get Commissioner Anders next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10075)|
| 2:47:56| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10077)|
| 2:47:58| MPC is not on trial in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| It's for Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| Is John King still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| I'll ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| Can you come down, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| I'll ask you a question since you're impartial this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| Who can he bill for this, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| Well, I asked Joe and he was kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10099)|
| 2:48:27| Sorry to put you on the spot, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| I just had a quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| I'd like to apologize to everybody for not having Lyft or Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:36| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| He was talking about, Arthur was talking about going back to MPC and putting restrictions on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| Do those restrictions follow the subsequent owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| And the reason I'm asking you is because you're a property guy and Arthur has a dog in the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10132)|
| 2:48:57| If the zoning, would the zoning follow on the deed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10137)|
| 2:49:03| The zoning on the property will follow the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| If you put a zoning classification on there and that zoning classification has conditions in it, it follows the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10145)|
| 2:49:12| I believe I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| That was mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| I'm sorry, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| I appreciate you coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| I have some questions and some comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| And one of my questions was also that one, Brad, that if you approve something with specific restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10167)|
| 2:49:33| even if those restrictions are more than what is normally placed on that particular piece of zoned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10173)|
| 2:49:42| I'll wait until you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| Similar to Brad's, that if you approve restrictions on a piece of property that are beyond what is normal restrictions for that particular zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10194)|
| 2:50:05| if the property changes ownership, do those increased restrictions still apply or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10205)|
| 2:50:13| The conditions run with the land rather than the ownership, so they would apply until they were changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10213)|
| 2:50:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| And also I want to make sure that, and I agree with Mike's assessment that so many of the uses that are permitted under what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10222)|
| 2:50:36| asking for here, rural commercial would just never be, you just couldn't do them on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10236)|
| 2:50:43| It would just be an impossibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| But for all the things that the community is so concerned about with rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| there are just as many problems the way it's zoned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10250)|
| 2:50:55| Somebody could put a trailer park there or a chicken farm or, I mean, having it zoned agricultural can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10255)|
| 2:51:06| I mean, if you're concerned about that sort of impact on your neighborhood, no, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| But I'm just pointing out that agricultural doesn't prevent that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10271)|
| 2:51:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:18| It could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| But the thing is, the way that, and I've been out and I've walked the land and I've seen and I've done the whole TVA thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:26| There's so little that you could do with that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| So incredible little, even if you wanted to build a residential place to live, you're so limited with that property that I don't think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10289)|
| 2:51:40| would need to be worried that any of those things would ever come to pass because it's just not possible on that piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10300)|
| 2:51:48| I'm concerned with the fact that I don't like amending sector plans that are pretty much brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10308)|
| 2:51:58| Hey, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10318)|
| 2:52:02| Am I interrupting anything back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10322)|
| 2:52:08| I don't like amending sector plans that are fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| But I also feel like with this, with the Fox Road Corridor study being, I mean, that was nine years ago, things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:23| What I would like to see, instead of doing anything tonight, I would actually prefer to put this off for 30 days and see if the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10343)|
| 2:52:38| and the neighborhood groups can get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| Because I think if the neighborhood group is going to stick to no development there whatsoever, we don't want anything done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10360)|
| 2:52:49| I'm afraid that you're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| And I think that if you go to the table and meet with the developer, then you have a really good opportunity to get this done in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10372)|
| 2:53:04| that you would be much more comfortable with it in terms of you could require that he do certain road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10384)|
| 2:53:13| He's willing to work with you on landscaping, hours of operation, the type of restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10393)|
| 2:53:23| I really have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| Yeah, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10407)|
| 2:53:33| I'm not comfortable with the attitudes and the accusations that have gone back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10413)|
| 2:53:42| I feel like we've lost some ground there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| And would really like to see an effort to come to some sort of agreement that hopefully could be seen as a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10425)|
| 2:53:55| I think that this development plan has a great deal of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10435)|
| 2:54:01| And this is a great opportunity for the neighborhood to get that land developed in a way that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10441)|
| 2:54:11| that would give you some control over how it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| Because I think eventually, the one question I do have is what is, the restaurant business is a really tough business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10454)|
| 2:54:25| And if this goes under in two years, what could happen to that property at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10465)|
| 2:54:38| If you limit it, that's all that can go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| And if you put conditions of control on it, that's all that can be done with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10481)|
| 2:54:48| Restaurant business is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| Mr. Kennedy has fortunately been successful in the business and has been in it for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10491)|
| 2:55:01| I mean, like any business, there are business risks, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| Who thought GM would be impacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| Commissioner of Royals, if I could, just a point of clarification right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| Even though the Fox Road study was done back in 2001, when we updated the sector plan in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:21| it was the staff and concurred by the commission who felt like that that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10521)|
| 2:55:27| the way those proposals and that policy for that stretch were still current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| So it's not like it's been almost a ten-year look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:37| It was considered to be still a current and valid proposal for Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10537)|
| 2:55:45| By means of explanation, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| we have some commissioners who have been here since 9.30 this morning with one meeting after the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10547)|
| 2:55:52| Others have been at it since 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| So as you might imagine, the hour is getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| However, having said that, this is an item that's very important to you folks and to Mr. Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| So we want to give you the ample time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| And it's our policy to allow citizens to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| So if you would come and give us your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| This is the first time I've done anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| I'm very nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| But I don't belong to any of the homeowners groups because I live on Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| a quarter of a mile from where this proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| Ma'am, can we have your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| Elizabeth Barnes Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| I go by Libby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| And I live at 922 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| Like I said, I'm a quarter of a mile from this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| I don't know anything or didn't know anything about this process until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10595)|
| 2:56:40| And I expected that I would hear about the proposals before things like this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| And I know that you guys have all been and had the advantage of seeing what was supposed to be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10605)|
| 2:56:51| But I live very close, and I didn't hear anything about it except the sign that was posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| I got no notice in my mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| I got no flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| I have no information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| So you have an advantage over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| What I do know is that when I go out to get my mail, if I'm not very careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| someone will hit me because the road is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| And if these gentlemen widen the road in front of their proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10631)|
| 2:57:17| the traffic still comes right beside my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| And when it comes there after someone's been drinking at night, I have to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| and so do the people who live adjacent to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| I hope you will think very long and hard about what you decide to do about a piece of property that affects my life every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10648)|
| 2:57:36| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| My name is Bob Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10661)|
| 2:57:42| I live at 739 Valley Hill Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| That is part of the Lovell Hills Homeowners Development, which is immediately adjacent to Tanrera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:53| We are in opposition to the appeal, if that's the correct word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10673)|
| 2:57:59| to this body based on MPC's previous unanimous ruling against this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10679)|
| 2:58:08| for all the reasons that have been previously mentioned, the railroad crossings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| the narrowness of Fox Road, the proposal to put in a center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:19| And for all of you who have been there, you know that that road is a straight stretch heading west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:25| It is bordered on the north side by a railroad track, which means that piece, the westbound lane, will not be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| To put in a center lane, you're going to have to move the property line towards the water line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| which means somebody coming off Canton Hollow onto Fox Road is going to have to make an immediate 90 degree left turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10715)|
| 2:58:42| bear to the right into some adjoining property to accommodate this center turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10722)|
| 2:58:49| That adds stress to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| Canton Hollow Road is a killer road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| There is a long history of accidents on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| The most recent one was yesterday with another single car rollover with injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| You cannot pass two legal boat trailers traveling in opposite directions on that road without somebody going in a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10740)|
| 2:59:09| Finally, you are a new commission, and we respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| Knox County citizens look to you for a new way of governing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10753)|
| 2:59:20| The MPC has made a ruling, and for you to just arbitrarily turn it over for lack of any other mistake that MPC may have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10760)|
| 2:59:34| would just not be right and certainly not send the right message to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10774)|
| 2:59:40| If MPC made a mistake, send it back for corrective action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| But this constant back and forth, oh, well, we'll accommodate you here, we'll accommodate you there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| the citizens don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| Thank you for your time and have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| Hi, my name is Lori Spaulding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| I live at 102-17 El Pinar Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| I've lived there 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| I travel Fox Road, Canton Hollow Road every day four times a day behind buses, beside buses, going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10801)|
| 3:00:11| I was just amazed when I found out they were going to put a restaurant there four times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10811)|
| 3:00:17| Four times a day, 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| That affects Farragut High School, Bearden High School, West Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10820)|
| 3:00:27| You cannot, I mean, schools get out at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| They get out at 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| He's not going to close his restaurant on the days that they get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:38| I do it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| It's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10840)|
| 3:00:41| I had an accident where a young man who was 17 years old went over the hill right where he's proposing his restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| flew out of his car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| He would have landed in the restaurant on the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10850)|
| 3:00:54| He's lucky to be alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| My husband's a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10856)|
| 3:00:57| He ran down the railroad track over the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| He saved his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| I mean, you might visit it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| You might go down it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| Eighteen years, four times a day at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| It's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| Do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| Do it for a week at least four times a day with the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| I know he's going to, you know, oh, we'll do this, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| Well, it's nice to say it on paper, but somebody was on the property the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| and they were coming out, and I almost hit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| I was not speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10891)|
| 3:01:32| I've got four children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| They've been in accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| If you don't live there, you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| And it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| I'm all for restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10903)|
| 3:01:44| I love to go there, eat out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| But I wouldn't put one in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| I wouldn't put one in Forest Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| You know, the UT property is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10916)|
| 3:01:58| We could put one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| They need money bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| It's just seeing it once, seeing it twice is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| Do it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| I won't even let my child, he's 15, he's learning how to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10930)|
| 3:02:13| I don't let him go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| I want him to have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| I'm wanting to wrap this up if we can because I believe that we're needing to get a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10941)|
| 3:02:26| The lady won't speak, and I'm going to ask you to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| and then I'm going to let the commissioners ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| I'm Susan Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| I live at 1000 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| I live closer than 922 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| It's not even a quarter of a mile from the proposed site to my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10957)|
| 3:02:43| I have sent each of you an e-mail concerning the things that have happened in my front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10963)|
| 3:02:52| the accidents, the mailboxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| and heaven forbid someone had been there when the mailbox was hit or the fire hydrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| My concern is we are increasing traffic on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| It doesn't matter if he puts a turn lane in front of his restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10986)|
| 3:03:11| They're still coming in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| There is no way to widen this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| It does not, it cannot handle 10,000 people a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| It can't handle 1,000 more people a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| We have accidents on this road constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| People fly down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11010)|
| 3:03:32| You can't put speed humps on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| It's not a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| This is not something that can be handled by putting speed humps or adding a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11017)|
| 3:03:44| You can't add more traffic to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11024)|
| 3:03:50| I understand and I appreciate the homeowners or the property owners wanting to sell their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11030)|
| 3:03:59| But if they price it a reasonable amount of money, it will sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11039)|
| 3:04:05| It's on the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| It will sell no matter if it's next to the marina or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| This is something that Metropolitan Planning Commission denied this 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11052)|
| 3:04:19| They did look at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11059)|
| 3:04:22| And if I had known that the commissioners were going to their property, I would have joined you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11062)|
| 3:04:29| and invited you to come down to my property and stand in my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11069)|
| 3:04:34| I fear when I have to mow the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11074)|
| 3:04:39| I'm afraid that I will get hit because people fly down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| And I know we want to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| And I really appreciate you all being here for this amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11085)|
| 3:04:48| But this is our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11088)|
| 3:04:51| This is where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| Mr. Kennedy lives in Sequoyah Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| Let's put it in Sequoyah Hills at one of those properties that have houses that price it commercial and put something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11097)|
| 3:05:08| They have the traffic flow that can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| And Knox County is not going to wind the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| We can't even get a sheriff's department guy to sit there and run radar just to slow the people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11115)|
| 3:05:22| I appreciate that we need more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| I appreciate that he's going to employ other people or lots of people or 70 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11125)|
| 3:05:32| That's 70 more people a day coming down my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| This is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| And I really ask you to go with the Metropolitan Planning Commission's suggestion to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11138)|
| 3:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11148)|
| 3:05:49| Commissioner, could I have just one final comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11151)|
| 3:05:52| What I'd like to do is let you have one comment and then one more comment from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| Then we'll let the commissioners and then we'll be ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11157)|
| 3:05:58| There's been comments of characterization about the MPC that we've cleared up tonight in terms of their involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11158)|
| 3:06:04| Also, I want to make clear that the proposal for us all to get together will somehow make the residents who oppose this change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11164)|
| 3:06:12| We've already met on site with Mr. Kennedy, ultimately looked at his plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11172)|
| 3:06:18| It doesn't change the objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| And that's why I had that closing statement that this is not about picking on Mr. Kennedy and his restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11180)|
| 3:06:25| This is about the continuity of a sector plan, plans on Fox Road and the like that are all new and well-done plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11185)|
| 3:06:33| We're asking you to stay with those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| And we're asking you, please, please, to consider the comments of these ladies who are just standing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11195)|
| 3:06:41| Nothing getting Mr. Kennedy and us together is going to change the nature and the characteristics of a road that presents hazards and risk to your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11201)|
| 3:06:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11211)|
| 3:06:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11212)|
| 3:06:53| Mr. Seymour, do you have any closing comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| Closing, I would reiterate what I have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| We will be happy to answer any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| There are restaurants in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Sequoia Hills has a restaurant right in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| There used to be a grocery store down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| There's a filling station down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| Commercial and residential are not incompatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11229)|
| 3:07:13| If you all have any more questions, Mr. Kennedy used to live just a very short distance from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11233)|
| 3:07:20| That's how he became acquainted with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| Amy and I probably are trying to work toward the same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11245)|
| 3:07:30| We're looking for a win-win, but it does, as we've just heard, bring up the question of actually what's before us, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11250)|
| 3:07:38| This is not something where we're asking this proposed property owner to go deal with the residents again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11258)|
| 3:07:47| The focus in front of us is very narrow, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| It's either to uphold the appeal, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11270)|
| 3:07:54| It is to uphold the Metropolitan Planning Commission's denial or send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11274)|
| 3:08:05| That's the two directions that we're facing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| Yes, and the substitute motion you have on the floor is to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| That's all that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| I like your conversation of trying to get things worked out, but we've just heard the community has no way of working it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11296)|
| 3:08:29| I'm disappointed, too, in the attitude that I've heard from both sides about mischaracterizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11309)|
| 3:08:40| I don't like when this sort of thing happens between developers and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11320)|
| 3:08:45| and I always much prefer for you all to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| And it's very unfortunate that you're so unwilling in this situation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11328)|
| 3:08:56| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| I'd just like to make one final comment, and then I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| A lot's been brought up tonight about the roads, the dangerous roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11343)|
| 3:09:10| Our forefathers were not road builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11350)|
| 3:09:13| That's very evident when you drive around this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| They talk about this Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| Let me tell you about Twin Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| In a half mile, there are three one-lane bridges, and at the end of that road is the county convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11360)|
| 3:09:26| which I will assure you puts more traffic through my little road than is ever going to come to this restaurant in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11366)|
| 3:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| You have a substitute motion before you, and that is to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11381)|

| 3:09:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11383)|
| 3:09:44| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part2?start=11384)|
