| 2:33:58| and even though we're laying it out and engineering it from a phased standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:05| we really feel like based on some of the interest we're getting if these people commit that the phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:13| and possibly even phase three really would kind of, for the general public, would almost be seamless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:19| But from a commitment as far as what we will be doing, even if you pass this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:27| we will have to have a written document with the IDB, the development agreement, that will spell all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:35| And not only that, we have to get our use on review permits through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:41| So there's a lot of safeguards that require us fulfilling what I've discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:51| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| Yes, I just want clarification on this, Joe, on exactly what the legal requirements are for a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9293)|
| 2:35:03| and also about the transfer of the TIF when a purchase is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:13| Can you go over that one more time for me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| Well, essentially Tennessee law provides for two kinds of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| Initially it was restricted to housing authorities, and the whole idea was to eliminate blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:26| It was then expanded for certain levels of economic development of which this does qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| Generally, the TIF is granted to a specific entity for the sole purpose of developing that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:41| Generally, depending upon how it's granted, it's not meant to be passed from developer to developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| but to a specific entity for the sole purpose of stimulating the local economy, creating jobs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| I'm going to make just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| South Grove was mentioned, $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| You look at South Grove today, this Thursday we will celebrate the opening of a Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| That's worth $2 million right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| Now, I know that you all are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part1?start=9373)|
