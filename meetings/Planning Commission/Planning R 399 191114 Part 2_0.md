| 0:00:00| We're going to continue on with agenda item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| Subdivision is Terrance Nest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=9)|
| 0:00:12| The applicant developer is Ralph Smith, PLS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| The location is the east side of Kate Road at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| with Caitlin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| Approximate acreage is 8.02 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:35| The proposed use is a duplex subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| The number of lots is 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| And there are 10 subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=41)|
| 0:00:50| The staff recommendation is to approve variances 1 through 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| because the existing site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| The proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| Also to approve the concept plan subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| And then a third vote to approve the development plan for up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| to 15 duplexes on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| for a total of 30 dwelling units subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:22| Ralph Smith, 205 Lamar Avenue, Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| There is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Sir, do you wish to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| Well, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| I mean, staff recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| And then kind of at a late date, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| believe they got some correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| from some of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| And Tom Bretzko forwarded me the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| that he got from Mrs. James, who lives right up on Kate Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| just across from our entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| And he shared with me what her concerns were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| I emailed her two or three times last night and discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| We pretty much agreed, she and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| that we were kind of at an impasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| Their opposition is for the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| and for overcrowding at Carnes School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| I don't think they really want rental units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| That's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| We think we've created a really nice plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| The developer, Dwight Disney, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| well-known in the community, does a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| with his developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| I think in the end, I believe everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| would be happy to see a really nice-looking and nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| functioning subdivision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| So if you've got any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=161)|

| 0:03:00| 1 through 10, because the existing site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| restrict compliance with subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| and the proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=184)|

| 0:04:11| which was pulled off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| The subdivision is Brandywine at Pepper Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| The applicant developer is Chris Sharp, urban engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| The location is east side of North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| north of Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Approximate acreage is 20.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=279)|

| 0:04:56| And the staff recommendations, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| will be two votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| One is to approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| because the topographic constraints and site conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| And the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| And the second vote to approve the request for up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=312)|

| 0:06:08| See how it impacts, I guess, my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| if there is any impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=370)|

| 0:06:34| We're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| I guess we're east, west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=400)|

| 0:07:06| And so you're just wanting to get a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| information from the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| One of the things that when we have people come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| and putting together plans, we do encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| them to reach out to neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| But you said you just purchased your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I feel certain that Mr. Sharp would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| be more than delighted to sit down with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| and talk about how his development will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| impact your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| But if you have any specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| maybe this is just a way for you guys to get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:41| Can I, real quick, I looked at this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| for another builder in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| And that property has been vacant for partially developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| And it was a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| It was a T-deck nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| And I believe Houston Homes out of Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| who's building in Knoxville, bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| that to do some houses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| And they're a good quality builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| And you're going to be way better off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| than what was there before they got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| because it was a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| So good for development to happen on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Mr. Sharp, did you want to address the commission at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| No, I'll give him the information he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:26| So you guys have exchanged contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:32| Just one quick comment is that if you look at the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| there, the southern part of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| there's a fairly large area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| been identified in this plan and actually a previous plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| to remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| So they will not be putting any development on that part that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| backs up to your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| So there is quite a bit of a protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| on that steeper hillside under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Commissioner Quincy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I would like to make a motion that we approve variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| one through three, because the topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| and site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| with subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| And the proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Quincy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=558)|

| 0:09:21| to approve variances one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| See no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=566)|

| 0:09:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| We have a motion by Commissioner Quincy, a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| by Commissioner Phillips to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=577)|

| 0:09:50| of the peripheral setback to 25 feet long North Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Station Road, subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=593)|

| 0:10:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Mr. Koltesar, I do want to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| for sitting through a long meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| and watching out what's going on for your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| That's good to be keeping an eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And I want to thank you for addressing the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Our next agenda item is number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| The applicant is Garrett Development and Construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| The location is the north side of East Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| southwest side of Cedar Crest Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| The approximate size of the tract is 0.42 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| The zoning is RA, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and CA, General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Proposed use is additional parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| in a more restrictive zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Staff recommendation is to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| for additional parking in a more restrictive zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| as shown on the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| subject to five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Yes, Garrett Tucker, 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| And I see several folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Do you have a spokesperson, or would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| like me to watch the time and kind of let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| you know as time progresses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| So one spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| OK, you're going to have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Mr. Tucker, do you want to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=708)|
| 0:12:02| My name is Sandra Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| I live at 7717 Cedar Crest Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| And the reason we are opposing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| is this lot was intended to be a subdivision lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| It is in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| And in the covenants and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| that were put in place when the subdivision was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| Plainly says that the subdivision shall be known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| and designated as residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| And no structure shall be erected, altered, placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| or permitted to remain on any of said lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| other than detached single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| And then it gives what type of dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| And the coffee shop, what basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| happened to give a little bit of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| is it was the house, the building, was a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| And it was a rezoned commercial a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and then sold to, I believe, Garrett Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| And they started renovating the house for a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| There was a driveway that was on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| The entrance to the business was Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| From what I understand, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| denied them use of that driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| And then Knox County gave them access to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| from the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| It's a big subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| There's only one entrance and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| And when people come into the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| they have to come in, go around the entrance, the island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| and then into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Three times in one week, I had people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| come into the subdivision as I was coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| of the subdivision, turn right into the coffee shop parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| lot without stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| That happened to numerous, numerous residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| And you have to be super cautious now leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| the subdivision because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I am in and out of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| at all hours of the day and night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| I personally do not feel that they need additional parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| to begin with, because just like today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| there were three cars parked on that lot, the residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| There were lots of empty spots in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| and in the rear of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| So it's really, I feel like, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| create even more of a hazard if people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| are able to get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| And if nothing else, we need some kind of signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| so when people are coming into the subdivision that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| familiar with the fact that it is a residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| that they need to stop before they turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| And I don't know how we go about getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| And we need that, whether this is approved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| But I do not think that it should be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| because it is a residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Mr. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:31| So this started out as we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| all we needed was a TDOT permit when our client first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| came to us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| There wasn't an existing residence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| and the property was on commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| And unfortunately, TDOT would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| allow us to have access to make that a commercial entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| They wanted so many feet of separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| between Cedar Crest Road and that driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| which the property does not have enough frontage to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:03| So that limited access to only two Cedar Crest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| which was unfortunate, because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| would help with the traffic if another entrance could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| been made onto Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| They do need the additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| I think it's mostly for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| and just for when there's an overload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| just to have some extra parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| And we went through all the staff comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| We've worked with the staff to actually wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| to have another entrance onto Cedar Crest, which we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| were not allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| So we've limited it to just a few parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| We're going to make it the pervious pavement type stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| so that there's not any increase in stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| We can keep that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| We've got the plantings, double rows of evergreen trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| on 12-foot centers to buffer against the neighbors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| are doing this and to avoid lights at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| or whatever shining in on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I think signage probably would be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| just to warn people coming out of the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| and to warn people coming in to go to the coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| We are having some discussions with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and the owners of the property next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| and are looking at being able to bring an entrance on over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| to that property where we can get the separation that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| It's not a done deal yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| It's still kind of preliminary right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| TDOT has confirmed that they would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| They would give us an access at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| But we've got to work it out with those property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| The coffee shop needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| They need the parking, and they would like to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| And I understand it is an impact to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| I would submit that there's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| a few people in the neighborhood that like the coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| and may be frequent at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| But we would just like to ask for approval of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| With regards to signage there, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Because that's a county street, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| With regards to signage, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| some signage that could happen there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| We can have traffic engineering look at possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| It would be tough to have some kind of a stop sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| there because you get rear end accidents coming off Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| Have you done accident studies there, or has there been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| What would generate an accident study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| Could that be something that you folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Yeah, we can look at that at previous crash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| history in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| We only get the ones where the Sheriff's Department responds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Right, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Sir, you do have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| If you look at the map, there's two lanes actually coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| of the subdivision and one coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| And what happens is people turn in the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| And then you've got people coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| So it's a head-on collision if they're not very careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| There is a sign up there that shows that there's an island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| but if you've been down Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| you understand people are, oh my gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| there's somebody running 60 miles an hour instead of 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| And so they hurry, and they make mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| and the mistakes are going to cause an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| It's nice that there's a turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| but perhaps an additional sign that says one way on the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| I don't know how, I'm not an engineer by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| but there's got to be some way to correct this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| or there is going to be an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| As you can see there on that, people turning left towards Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| come out closest to the island and then going towards Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| there on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| And then if you're turning in, you make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Sir, could you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Tony Schultz, S-H-U-L-T-S, 7801 Mike and Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| And if you could write that down too, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| And while you're doing that, Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I have about three comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| First, the restrictions, they don't apply to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| That's an agreement between you and the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| when you bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| And they need to be handled outside of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| Secondly, I'm very familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| That and my problem with the parking lot is it's encroaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| You know, you're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| OK, we've got the coffee shop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Then we have the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Then what comes next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And the reasoning is always, well, it's next to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| or it's next to office or it's next to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| So that justifies it being changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| And what we're doing is moving further into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| When I looked at the submittal here, and it shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:46| and that subdivision's been there for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| It's not a brand new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| When I looked at the submittal and saw the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| around it, and it looks to me like there will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| be a driveway on the new parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| I have a hard time with it because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| even beyond the subdivision entrance name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| This is just pushing back further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Then what do you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Well, the next house wants to be commercial or not commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| but office or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| And I think that's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| I'm not going to make a motion, but I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| to hear what the others think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| We're not rezoning the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| We're just giving them a use on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| So technically, we're not pushing commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| I think going into the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| I have a hard time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| But we're not rezoning that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| We're just approving a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| It's staying, what, PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:17| So we're not pushing the commercial back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| The commercial's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| We're just giving them a restricted use on that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| And I understand what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| but I think you do a good job of landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| You're trying to help a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Probably are people in that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| that frequent the coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| I think it would be a better idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| to get the piece of property right next to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| but apparently they can't do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| But as long as you do a decent landscape screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| and you don't rezone that piece of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| back into the subdivision, I would not support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| But I'll make a motion that we approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| for additional parking in a more restrictive zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| as shown on the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| subject to the five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:08| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| One moment, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I will get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| And I will get to you, but just we're here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| And I will get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| So yes, I did want to first go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| Commissioner Hill, you had a light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| I did, but Commissioner Clancy said all that I needed to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:39| Commissioner Smith, you had a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Yeah, you still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| What we're talking about here, the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So that's predicated on this being used for a coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| So if at any point in time the coffee shop goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| there's a for lease sign up, and some other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| wants to go, does that mean that this parking lot is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| able to be used for that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| without another use on review when the use changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I was going to ask that same question when I got confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| But I would defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| I'm going to state an answer and then look to our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| The use on review here is the parking lot, not the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| The business is in a commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| and is permitted in that commercial lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| My interpretation would be that what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| is the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| It's not tied to a particular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| It's to serve that commercial lot adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| So any business, and this is my interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| I'll look to Mr. Wise for confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| or to set me straight, because I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| take either one because I'm on uncertain ground here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| But my interpretation would be that because only the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| lot is used on review, unless we tie it through a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| to the parking lot, it can only be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| to serve the existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| I just, you know, that's the thing that, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| in a neighborhood, I mean, people live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| That parking lot goes in, it becomes permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| And coffee shops, although it's probably a great coffee shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| who knows, it may go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| And then you're dealing with other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| I just, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I'd like to hear from Mr. Wise, Opine, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Typically, use on reviews do not run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| Here, there's actually, Mr. Bill pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| that this says prior to getting a grading permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| there's supposed to be a combination to site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| the adjoining commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| So they're apparently anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| that this is going to be a re-subdivision of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| And I'm not sure what the implication of that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| But typically, a use on review is specific to the existing use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| and doesn't run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| The law is not just utterly clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| That's why I would counsel you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| if you felt like this is a use that does not run with the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| that is, the next guy doesn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| to use it without being permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| that you draft your motion to incorporate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| that this use is applicable to the existing coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Before I go to you, Mr. Clancy, Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and I will, I'd like to hear from Ms. Exton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| My question is, he mentioned that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| were trying to work something out with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| owner on the other side of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| If they get that worked out, and if the state approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| will the entrance and exit from our subdivision be closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| Sir, we can't hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| And I think that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| I believe they would still want the entrance off of Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Crest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:54| Part of what they're trying to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| and even this parking lot's not going to accomplish that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| is to be able to have a circular drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| where people can come around and pick up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| order, and then can drive around and pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| And the way it is right now, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| only one way in and one way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| You'd have to do a U-turn, and it would just be crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| So they haven't been able to open the drive-through window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| And so that would allow that, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| would remove some of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| I think a lot of people would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| come in on Cedar Crest and then leave via Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| That would just seem logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I see your light, but Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| had his non-light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| The one concern I had is combining two lots into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| Certainly, the perception is that in future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| it's going to be considered commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| and it might be more of a enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| I don't know if it's better, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| to leave them as two separate parcels or combining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| It's kind of a toss-up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Which one's the best interest for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| or the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| I don't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I can see your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Do they have to be combined, is kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Can they stay as separate parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And I think from preserving the zoning lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and the distinction between the zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| keeping them as two separate lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| would likely be the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Because it may become a residential lot at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| There's a very good chance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Commissioner Phillips said exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| or asked the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| If they were to combine the two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| then what happens to our motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| It gets changed as soon as you let me change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| Commissioner Oden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| I'm tracking the same with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| If this thing gets combined, then you technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| probably could build a bigger building on the first piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and have some adjoining parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And there could be some slippery slopes right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| with what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| And I'm not thrilled to death with this new drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| option either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| A little, small, quaint coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| in front of a subdivision where you've got pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and people walking down and taking their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| and kicking around is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| But when people are just ripping in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| of that subdivision just to go in and out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| because it's easier than Dunkin' Donuts, I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| If the drive-through was there, it's been there, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| My fellow commissioners has caused me to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| How, Mr. Wise, can we put forth a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| and maybe amend the motion, Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| to where we can provide them the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| yet that this does not run with the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| or keep it two separate parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| You know, the other thing, another consequential thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| is an empty building there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| So you've got to make some provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| for a business to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And not to intrude on the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| but if we could limit the parking in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| that we don't combine the parcels to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| they could build a bigger building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| I would certainly support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I think you can take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Excuse me, Commissioner Clancy, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| know that you do want to amend your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| But this is a really good use case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| for not making motions until commission has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| an opportunity to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Commissioner Smith, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| You had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Mr. Bruchko wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:06| There's an empty chair there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| I think the issue of combining the lots together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| would be more crucial if this were required parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| And it is not needed for required parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| for the facility because you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| to provide the parking on the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| unless you had an agreement, I guess in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| with themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| So I don't think it's as crucial that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| has to be combined together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| And I think the idea of just probably changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| in the staff recommendation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| it says parking in a more restrictive zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| for the existing coffee shop would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| tie it, I think, to that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Do you agree with that, Mr. Wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| What Mr. Bruchko just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| I didn't understand what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| And I think I tend to agree with Mr. Bruchko| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| because I support my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| I think it may be even more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| if a condition is that the parking on the adjacent lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| is for the existing coffee shop only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| And then leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| And then to eliminate condition two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| which speaks to the combination of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| So still have five conditions, but eliminate condition two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| and add a condition that the parking lot on the adjacent lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| is to serve the existing coffee shop only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Just a quick question, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| How would this be documented in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| with the CODE's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| In five years, 10 years, another business comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| where will it be shown that this requirement is on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| The staff report goes to the CODE's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We'll send it to the CODE's office, let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| On the zoning map on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| those that have a condition are marked with a K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| so we'll make sure that K is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| And then that signal is looking at the planning case page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| and identifying the conditions that are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| So we'll work with CODE's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| and with County Public Works and Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| and the property owner, the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| And we look to the neighbors to assist us in enforcing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| because obviously if the use may change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| and someone forgets and we won the lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| and they're gone and it's someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| and you're there to watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| so we depend on you as the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| to make us aware of any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Another question, too, is lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Will this particular area be lit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Was there any conditions on lighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Taryn, another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I feel more comfortable, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| adding that as a condition that lighting not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| since it is adjoining a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| One other thing, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| you know, I'm by there numerous times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| They, as far as parking, they have ample parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| without using that residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| But it's obvious what they are wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| is to be able to have a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| So it's not the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I think that what we're talking about is conditioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| to make sure that what it is is parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| for the existing coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| That is once I get to, once I allow Mr. Clancy to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| then he is going to be making some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| But I'm feeling a little uncomfortable about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| because there, as Commissioner Phillips mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| there is no conditions with regards to lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| On this, and I'm almost of the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| that this one maybe needs a little bit more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| It's the way I'm feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| but I know there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Yeah, I'm becoming against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| because I don't, nothing against the coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| I want them to do well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| but I just feel like we're just going to create more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| We're going to add parking and a drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| in the front of a residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I mean, I think it's a quaint coffee shop now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| but I mean, why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| I don't really think the need for this parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| for this little business in a residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| outweighs the, really what the people that live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| they sleep there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I mean, do we, is this something we really need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| I don't think so myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Thanks. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| I don't disagree with Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| I don't think it's going to impact the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| I will, and this is really easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| I will amend my motion and it may not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| but I'll amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| It's not hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I'd like to amend my motion to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| subject to five conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| deleting condition number two as it exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and adding another condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| which states that the parking lot is adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| that is adjacent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| serves only the business that is there on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And I think that kind of takes care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| most of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Lighting, I don't think they're going to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| the parking lot if they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| It doesn't look like they're going to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| put as much money as they can in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| And there's a considerable landscaping buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Which should help with any lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Commissioner Hill, you had seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Do you agree with the revised motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I do and I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| I'd like to see the addition of the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| existing business rather than just the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| so that it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| it seems a little vague the way you stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| So amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| And then what about addressing the lighting issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| You can vote on my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I don't think lighting's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| And you can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| I would like to hear from some other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| if that's the difference of approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| if it has to do with adding restriction to lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| And if so, I would encourage my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| to add it as a condition to limit the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| I would do such that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I mean, I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I think that what I'd like to do at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| because we've had some motion and some amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I'd like to vote this current motion up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| And then if it passes, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| If it does not pass, then we can work on another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Is that acceptable to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Does that, Mr. Brush, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| It's not acceptable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Well, just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| I was trying to make sure we talked for the adjacent use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Were we talking, did that get changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| to reference in the coffee shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| The existing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Existing coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Business is what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Well, it may be better to be more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| as it may be, what was the business at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| to be specific to that use, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| So it may be a coffee shop today and a jewelry shop tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| I don't think we all know at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| what the existing business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I see some more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Let's vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| You want to say something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| Madam Chair, would it be procedurally appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| to offer a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| This body doesn't operate by Robert's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| and it operates by its own rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| and it doesn't really have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Now, you can default to Robert's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| if the chair chooses to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| It's discouraged because it complicates matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| If a substitute motion was made, it would require a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| That would require a vote to substitute the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| and that would require debate on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| which would be up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| And so the practice that we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| is if something gets out there and the chair recognizes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| and that has occurred at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| that's voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Unlike other parliamentary bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| if it doesn't pass, you just go to the next thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| It's very simple, very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| And I would encourage you to keep it very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And that's what the chair is trying to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| I was unaware that we did not adhere to Robert's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| and I was unaware that that was discouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| And because of that, I will not offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| We call it Bob's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| And I see Carlene rolling her eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| But, Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| I'm going to respond to Commissioner Hill's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| about having other responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I think basically we're voting for or against a drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| and we already have a president of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| turning in their own direction already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Drive-thrus that I've been associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| generate a lot more business than a walk-in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And we're talking about an area that used to serve as a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Had a granddaughter that lived three houses up from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| And I'm pretty adverse to affecting the safety of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Commissioner Easton, I know that you just turned your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I do want to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Unless you want to have something to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| before we do a vote on this particular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Could I say that we're not doing a drive-thru?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| I mean, that's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| This will not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Somewhere, somehow, somebody said drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Well, I mentioned drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| That's only if we were able to do the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| This will not do a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Current motion on the floor by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| seconded by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| to approve the request subject to five conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| striking number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| and adding the fifth condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| that the parking lot shall serve only the existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| That's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Motion...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Do we have another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| I would like to offer up a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| that would be all the conditions that Mr. Clancy has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| limiting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I guess, limiting lighting or prohibiting lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| and prohibiting a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2568)|

| 0:42:56| if I have the authority to prohibit a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| That would be my question to Jared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| I'm not sure we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| because we're not really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| I believe that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| ...reviewing on the actual property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| where the building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| just the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| There are two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| The request is not for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| It's for the use of the adjacent property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| so I'm not sure we could prohibit a drive-thru at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| No lighting on this is an easy one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| but the prohibition of the drive-thru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| would be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2600)|

| 0:43:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| I think we're treading on pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| very thin ice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| and I would not recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2613)|

| 0:43:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2621)|

| 0:43:45| We have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| from what I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2626)|

| 0:44:06| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| It was some very good discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| and some good learning for future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| as we're looking at some uses on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| We're moving on to agenda item number 33 I don't this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:36| I don't see a title on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Amendment to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| Okay, this is a amendment to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance and I am going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| to have asked Mr. Green to present. Thank you. This is the proposed amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2694)|
| 0:45:02| establish a plan development approval process that has been before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| Commission worked on since I believe April of this year. The Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| recommended approval and went to County Commission was remanded back in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| address some comments that were received just before the second reading at County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Commission. The staff worked with the committee composed of two members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| Planning Commission, representatives of the development community, community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| members of the Knox County Planning Alliance, staff from engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| County Engineering and Public Works to address the comments that were received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| We addressed all those comments. We received a couple additional comments in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| the past few days and stated at the agenda review meeting there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| three questions that came up. One was the section 6.80.02| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| purpose. Item number B for the to substitute the word demonstrate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| existing word encourage and section 6.80.03 whether to authorize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| throughout the county or prohibited in the rural area and the final one was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| to reinforce the direction before that this would be final approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| the preliminary plan would be by the County Commission. With that I have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| further comments. I'd be happy I think Mr. Klein have some comments to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| any comments from Mr. Klein or other members of the public or the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| Staff does recommend approval with direction on those three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Right at this point before we go to Commission I'd like to hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| public any any comments or or thoughts. I know that there's several people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| have been that have been following this quite closely and did you write down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| your name and address? I did. All right and name and address for the record. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| name is Wayne Klein. I'm at 617 Main Street here in Knoxville. I'm here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| behalf of the Westland West Homeowners Association and other community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| organizations that have asked to be heard on the subject of whether this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| is appropriate legislation and I think this this question probably goes more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| towards the Commission and their attorneys but we want to make the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| here at this level too. State statute requires either a plan for everything or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| districts. Our county legislative body has has placed our county into districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| and this amendment would do away with the requirements associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| individual districts. TCA, Tennessee Code Annotated Section 13-7-101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| is where the authority comes to divide either into districts or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| treat your county as one giant planned unit. The TCA Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| 13-7-102 requires that all regulations shall be uniform for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| district, for each class of property and so this particular amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| would allow our County Commission to do away with that regulation, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| contravene that regulation and change standards that are not appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| because we're in districts and districts must be uniform according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| statutes. TCA Section 13-7-205 establish that the chief legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:51| body, that's the County Commission in this case, can establish a Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Zoning Appeals. I think the Metropolitan Planning Commission and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| associated with the legalities of this amendment had decided to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| the power in the MPC and County Commission for this purpose and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| would also contravene TCA 13-7-205 which says if you create a standard or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| use or for purposes of a variance, you create a BZA. We don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| BZA involved in this amendment. 13-7-1093 defines the powers of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| Boards of Appeals. That's what we're talking about here and so I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| trying to give you a legal argument to snow you on trying to make a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you very much for your time. I'll respond to Mr. Kline in that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| attorney has an opinion so I'll give you another attorney's opinion. As I stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| at the agenda review, I asked this question of Sam Edwards who's a land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| use attorney, provided training for the Commission and has worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Planning Commissions throughout the state for 30 plus years. He stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| as a legislative process, the County Commission is empowered to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| issues like this if the exceptions are identified as exceptions, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| variances and they are identified as exceptions. If the standards for granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| those exceptions are set forth in the ordinance and the standards are for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| exceptions are set forth in Section 6.80.04 and it states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| B subsection states, exceptions from district regulations may be granted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| planned developments if the exceptions provide all of the following benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Those are clearly set forth, the benefits that the development must meet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| order to be granted those exceptions. According to Mr. Edwards, that passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| the test. Again, to further delegate this authority to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| Section 6.80.01 clearly states that that authority is delegated for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| approval process in the County Commission. I would note that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| of Knoxville has passed a less robust version of this approval process with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| no concerns expressed by their legal staff, which I think is very well versed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| in the zoning and its various implications. Unfortunately, I think what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| may hold here is something that in the first job I had as a planner, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| city attorney told me, I asked a question about legality of something. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| said, anything is legal until the judge tells you it's not. We may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| pushing, I admit, and I appreciate Mr. Klein's concern, and I've heard it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| another, but I think we've tried, we've addressed it. I do feel the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| staff feels, the stakeholder committee, the county mayor's office all feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:12| that this authority to grant these exceptions is better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| delegated to the County Commission, which has a broader purview and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| more adept at listening to public input than the Board of Zoning Appeals. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| think it's a better place to place that. Other states have done similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| things and vested or delegated that authority to the chief legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| body, having set the standards on which the granting of those exceptions must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| be based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Was there any other members of the public that would like to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| before we go to commission? Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Yes, I was one of the planning commissioners that were on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| committee, and I said in a general review, and I can't remember if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| brought this up the first time we approved this, but as a developer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| tries to do things the right way, don't get it right all the time, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| very, very excited about this new, fresh concept about raising the bar for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| development in Knox County, and I applaud Gerald. I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| I think this is a very progressive, hard line to demand very good quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| development in Knox County, and I think that the fortunate people or the few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| people that try to take this path, the bar is going to be set very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| There were two very vocal members of this community that were a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| stakeholder committee that echoed the document and the approval process here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| and I'm excited to see where this goes, and I would like to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| approve this amendment to the Knox County zoning ordinance to create a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| plan development approval process per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten, a second by Commissioner Crowder to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| recommend that approval of this, and I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:13| Commissioner Easton, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| I had a question about whether or not we're going to address any of the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| questions that Director Green asked, or if you're suggesting with your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| that we approve it just as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Do we have a refresher of the three questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| The questions are in section 6.80.02B, whether the encourage should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| demonstrate, and I think one's as good as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| I'm not an English major, but I think if you encourage something or demonstrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| it's about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| I would stick with the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| And on 6.80.03, the authorization in section A, it states that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| permitted in the rural area, and that's a tougher one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| There may be places, opportunities where this could be used in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| So staff would even probably, trying to reach a compromise that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| permitted in the rural area unless approved or authorized by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| Commission through the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Basically, you're saying what you can apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| So why would we want to prevent somebody from applying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Thank you, Commissioner Easton, for bringing this up, because I do remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| during agenda review that I had an issue with not allowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| If it's going to have a lot of oversight and input, then I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:58| I like the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| And what was the third one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| It's not authorized in the rural area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| I thought you said that you'd put it in the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Based on the direction from commissioners I've heard, staff would suggest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| section 6.80.03, authorization, deleting the last sentence, the plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| is not authorized in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| I would amend my motion to reflect that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And what was the third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| The third one was delegation of the final approval of the preliminary plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I think that staff recommends that that remain as stated in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| So your only amendment to your motion is to remove on 6.80.03 the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| sentence of part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| Which is the restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| That restricts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Does not allow it in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Striking that sentence will allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| And we do have a member of the public that would you like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| something to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Corinne Rivetti, 6925 Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| And did you also write it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| So I think many of us agree that this can be a very exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| multi-land use ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And I think we have many concerns that it can also be abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| And so stronger language is, I think, what we have been asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| And some of that has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| Not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| So coming back to the language about encourage versus demonstrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| You know, language is subtle, but it conveys a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| And I think it's important to make this a creative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| but not too squishy that the onus then comes back to all of you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| have to sit and discuss each and every one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And why don't we just, if we're approving a new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| make it as distinct as it can be so that it doesn't allow for abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| I think the encouragement of not using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| You know, this amendment can overlay zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| and I think that's one of the other concerns that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| that zoning is in place to protect certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| And creative is one thing, but using this ordinance to bypass zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:55| is one of those potential abuses that I think is foremost on my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| It is going to have a lot of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| It's going to have oversight from planning, from public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| It's going to have a lot of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| There's going to be public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Somebody coming in, sneaking in behind the scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| to do something that is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| Yes, and I know all in all, and certainly on my mind and many minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| that the first precedence that might come before this commission is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| project that is very questionable in terms of whether it fulfills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| and applies to the criteria of plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| And so I think it's crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| I think that that oversight exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Thank you for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Commissioner, is your motion stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I guess I just want to say, to some respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I do agree with what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| We just voted down creativity and flexibility with the drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| right there at that cusp of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| I guess it's the lawyer in me that really likes words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| and we rely all the time on words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| but encourage and flexibility and creative approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| those are not well-defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| To use your word, those are not distinct words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| It's nice to know what our purview is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| and it just seems that this is vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| It's a fine line between how do you define creative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| How do we put in firm, legal terms, creative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| When we're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| it could be looking at a 10-acre site that's a mixed type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| a new type of housing, a courtyard cottage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| or a pocket neighborhood, for example, that's not permitted otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Or it could be a 500-acre site that has some office, retail, multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| And that's a challenge that I went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Do we do that now, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Already we don't do any of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Someone doesn't come before us and give us a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Only on the use of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| And that doesn't have the encourage a creative approach, encourage flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| It's pretty loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| This is firmer than what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| while trying to allow for that flexibility and creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| I understand your point, and it's very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| So we don't have it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| So now we're going to go to the other extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| I think that's what happens, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| We pass laws that are over here, and then we go over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| and we always find out that it's really better right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I guess this is just, it's vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| It would be hard for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| And I look for consistency, consistent application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| and I just feel like we're going to build a lot of exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| And that's why there's the mandatory staff pre-application meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Then the planning commission, then county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Staff, planning commission, planning commission, and then county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| So there are these stop gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| And, unfortunately or fortunately, this body is charged with finding that place in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| that we don't swing too far one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| And even that, as we see each month, is challenging, finding the middle point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I don't envy you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Most days I don't envy myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| I just wanted to make sure that the deletion of the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| we are in the rural area, is doing what it's intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| It sounds like we're wanting to allow consideration within the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| but the first sentence says that authorization is only within the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| which also doesn't allow consideration within the urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| which is also in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Thanks for catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| And I would, if Commissioner Hill is amenable and Commissioner Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| I would suggest amending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Planned development is authorized in all zoning districts and parcels located in the Knox County planning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| I will come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| And I would tell Commissioner Boyer that as we see these plans come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| so the example of they submit us a conceptual plan that we don't even vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| You come back for a vote later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| It goes to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| You're not rezoning property at 1 to 5 per the acre or 1 to 10 per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| that some guy can drop his option on it and somebody else pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| You don't even have a clue what they're going to do, who the developer is, what their intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| You're going to decide if it's creative or flexible or demonstrating these things that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| They'll have multiple opportunities by proving themselves by the plans that this is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| So I'm fine with the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| I would be happy with the additional language that Executive Director Green just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| and I would ask him to repeat that again, the first two sentences, so it can be read in the record correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| And section 6.80.03, amending that subsection A to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| a plan development is authorized in all zoning districts and parcels located in Knox County's planning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:06| The Knox County outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:15| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| You're good with that, Commissioner Rutan, and Commissioner Crowder, you're good with that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| It's a classic example of what happens when you make a motion before it would be asked again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| I know he's going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| I've been waiting all day to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| I think it's a use case, not a classic example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| It's a use case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| Is that all you had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| I've been tracking your light for this long for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| You have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Can I ask Mr. Klein a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Can you explain what that distinguishment is when you said Knoxville as sections and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| Knoxville has been divided into districts, and accordingly the districts have various requirements for the construction of buildings and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| And what you're doing with this amendment, the argument is, what you're doing with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| is you're taking the objectivity out of the district requirements and placing subjectivity, which is creative and whatever you all decide, as the hallmark for what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:29| And to take it a step further in terms of the statutory argument, the statutes don't allow you to have this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:39| They say if you have districts, you have to be consistent within your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| And this would allow you to be inconsistent within your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| And I can take it further if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| Your light's still on, Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I was listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| I do not see any lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten, a second by Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Next is agenda item number 34, which is a consideration of an amendment to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| identifying automobile repair service as a use on review in CN Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| And I'm going to have to turn this over to Mr. Green to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| I won't say a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| I presented information on this at the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| I would note that earlier today I looked for CN zones in the county and found three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:53| And I did a quick review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| So the application, and there may be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| I'm not saying that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Trying to look at the KGIS map on the entire county and finding little zones was challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| But there may be a half dozen CN, so the application would be very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| And it is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| I know there was concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| We all can identify auto repair businesses that don't add to the aesthetic of any community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:22| But there are some that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| There are, again, there are standards with regard to the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| In the neighborhood commercial, there are basically design standards and landscaping standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| And then the standards for this is a use on review layer on top of those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| Add even more standards with regard to the size, the location, setback from residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| additional screening, restrictions on the storage of automobiles being repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| So trying to address the concerns, but also realizing that in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| these neighborhood commercial areas do try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Their goal is to provide services for the residents of surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| And I think we all realize that auto repair is something that happens as frequently as anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| And we do allow automobile fueling stations and convenience stores as a use on review in the neighborhood commercials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| which is probably a more intense use than the automobile repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| And this request for this amendment came from the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| so it wasn't something that I thought up late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| That's what you do is late at night think about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Yeah, I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| I think this will be, if this passes, this will be utilized a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| I have a lot of calls, and we do a lot of commercial leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| We have a lot of calls from these kind of businesses that have a hard time finding a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| So I think you're going to see this utilized quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| My question is really about is it Knox County that's going to be charged with enforcement regulation of how this works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:18| It's actually the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| The planning commission and the county commission set the standards through the ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| And then as a use on review, the planning commission will have an opportunity to assure it through the site plan review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| that those conditions are being applied at a planning stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| and then the county codes enforcement would be charged with enforcement of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| If one gets built and the neighbors are unhappy with the way it's being kept or the parking is overrun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| they would call codes and codes would handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| I think the biggest concern that all of us would have in a neighborhood would be outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| Is there any way that you can think of creatively how we limit outdoor storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| I've seen even in the most obvious places, you can go to Kingston Pike just west the property adjacent to Hooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:19| and you see cars draped all over the right-of-way at that Mr. Cool transmission there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| and I would just hate to see something get out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| And then you can go to Farragut and see how it's so orderly done with some of those on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| So I think the adverse effect would be outdoor storage, and is that addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| It is to some extent in 4.107.1 minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| A states that vehicle repair service establishments shall not store the same vehicle on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| outdoors on the lot, for a total of 30 days or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| That could be reduced so the same vehicle can't stay more than 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| including storage that occurs while the vehicle is under repair and once repair is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Only vehicles that have been or are being serviced may be stored outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| So that addresses part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Vehicles awaiting repair on which repair is complete or on which repair is complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| shall not be stored overnight in front of the structure housing the vehicle repair service business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| So even if it's waiting, been repaired, and the owner can't come until the next day to pick it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| they have to park it either inside or in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| The repair of vehicles and storage of all merchandise, auto parts, equipment, and supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| must be within a structure so that you can't have parts sitting out on your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:52| The structure housing, the auto repair business must be set back a minimum of 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| from residential property line when it abuts a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| If they abut a residential district, they must have a Type A landscaping buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| And number pretty much all those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| No sale of new or used vehicles is not permitted so it doesn't become a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| No partially dismounted, wrecked, junked, or discarded vehicles or vehicles that sit on one or more flat tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| or are inoperable in any manner may be stored on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| We're trying to address all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| Also, vehicle body repair shall not be permitted so it won't become a body shop with wrecked automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| We're trying to set standards that pretty well draw a tight circle around the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:49| Can I ask another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Well, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| And I'll try to be brief here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| So that first one in 4.107.1A, it says that they can store them outside no longer than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4436)|
| 1:14:05| Is that what I'm gathering there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| We could change that to five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| They can store it outside but not in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| It can't be stored in front of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| Yeah, that's the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| It's hard to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| And like so many things, ordinances that we have, what it provides is a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| If someone complains that an automobile has been stored or it's turning into a storage area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:39| then we have something to fall back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Unfortunately, all too often enforcement is challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| but the purpose of these standards is to provide a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| Commissioner Quincy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| I don't think you can condition this enough to make it a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| I don't think Coats Administration needs anything else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| I think at best you're going to have auto repair shops opening up in the middle of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| and where's the antifreeze going, big barrels of oil sitting around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| Not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Auto repairs should be done in a commercial zone where you have parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| where they can stage cars into their garage and out of the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| I think it's a good idea, and I'm not going to be able to support this no matter who makes the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| but it's not going to be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| He didn't make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| One other thing I thought I'd mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| My office has a car stereo business on one about 200 yards away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| and then a performance engine place across the street, and noise is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| I mean, the car stereo place, it's booming from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| and if I lived there and it was at, you know, that would get old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| so I don't know if noise is something we want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I think this is going to be an enforcement nightmare for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, I'm going to go ahead and take this one and make a motion to deny the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to not recommend to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:31| it's not really a denial, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| I think it's deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| Deny making the draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| Next on the agenda is agenda item number 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| the consideration of nomination of 2020 Knoxville, Knox County Planning Commission officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| I'm going to turn this over to Commissioner Buston, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| The nominating committee consisting of myself, Commissioner Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| and Commissioner Eason has convened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and we are ready to put forward nominations for chair and vice chair for calendar year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| The nominating committee is happy to recommend Commissioner Toker for chair of next year for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:30| I'll now entertain any nominees from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:39| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Go ahead, Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I'm having a hard time, don't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| You're too close to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Your recommendation, Janice, is your term up in June of 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| My term is up in 2020, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| So that means that we would be recommending for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| However, there are no term limits anymore, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| No, there are term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| The city has abided by the limit of two successive terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| and the county has committed to doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| I don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Commissioner Roth has been, this is his third term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:38| There was a new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| It was a partial term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Yeah, there's not been any appointments since the last time the letter agreement was put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| There was a letter agreement that incorporated the change, basically who hires the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| That's what precipitated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| In the course of that letter between the city and the county, letter of instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| it also incorporated provisions that there would be no appointments of terms beyond two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| So there are term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Now, whether the county and the city administrations will adhere to their own contract between the two of them is yet to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| But there have been no appointments since that letter instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| Steve, does that apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Can you not be appointed by the city for two terms and then be appointed by the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| Yes, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| So the two terms only apply successively to the same side of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I make a motion to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:47| I didn't hear for vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| Well, I'm going to do that next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Do it one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Now, this doesn't have anything to do with Janice other than her term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| I think she's done an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| And if her term wasn't going to expire, I would go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| But I think in your call for other nominations, I would like to nominate Pat Phillips as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| In light of the letter, if we're enforcing, may I have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| I'm not sure how to gain the floor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| In light of the letter, if the city and county are enforcing that, I certainly agree with Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:42| I think you've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| And I would certainly second for you if you had a full term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| But I would second Pat Phillips, assuming that Madam Chair is going to be rolling off in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4851)|
| 1:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| Do the conditions of commission not automatically put the vice chair in chair position when that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| It is a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| The vice chair does fill in for the chair if the chair does roll off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| The chair or the commissioner serves until the mayor appoints and the state confirms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:34| But, yes, the vice chair does fill in, but then there does need to be a vote for chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| Like we did for Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| I don't think that we ought to be doing something that we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:52| If we're nominating or electing a chairperson for a year, for the 2020 year, then that's what we should be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4912)|
| 1:22:03| not saying, well, six months from now we'll have the vice chair come on and then we'll elect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:12| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Get him for a year and go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| I don't think we should be breaking it up is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Well, next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| We've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| My opinion is that if we weren't forced to vote on this, when she left in six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| she would have just left in six months and we would have appointed somebody to take her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| So I would be voting just to let her continue to do what she's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| and then we'll let Mr. Phillips have it when she leaves, if that would be what the rest of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| I would agree with that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| I think Janice has done a remarkable job, and she's only been doing this, what, a little over a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| And I'd like to see her continue at least for another six months or until her term is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| Let's call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Are there any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| We certainly can next month take a vote, whether we want to continue with Chair Toker for the remainder of her term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:25| and whether we want Commissioner Phillips, if he'll agree to become Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| So we can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| We can take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Mr. Wise, is that since Commissioner Graf is nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| You've got two nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| You'll vote on them next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| But it's still open until there's a motion to close nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| There may be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| I'll make a motion to close nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| And for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| I think it was right before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| So we have a motion and a second to cease the nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| And also the nominating committee would like to recommend Commissioner Phillips for Vice Chair of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:18| Again, I'd like a motion to close nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| So we will be voting on this next month by doing the closing that our slate is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:39| We will not have additional nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| In other words, next month prior to the vote, we can't nominate anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| So if you choose Commissioner Phillips as the chair, then it will have to be a special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| He'll have to be Vice Chair also, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| He can have both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| No, he can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| There would have to be a special election to go through the nomination to nominate and vote on a Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| On to 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| We are, okay, on to agenda item number 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| This is the consideration of an amendment to the sign ordinance in regards to regulations for all uses in the industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:29| And I would like Mr. Green to present, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| I'll do a quick presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| We went over this in agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| This request came from a city council member to look at signage standards for the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5136)|
| 1:25:44| The signage standards are dictated by the zone classification and by the classification of the highway on which the property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:55| There was concern, I believe, that institutional zones surrounded by residential districts would have large signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5155)|
| 1:26:04| In the review that staff did, and you've got some of that, most of the properties, 16 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| are zoned institutional with frontage on a federally designated highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| meaning they could have a sign of approximately 165 square feet or 20 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:25| All of those except one is a state, county, or city facility and not subject to the city zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:34| One of them is owned by the Industrial Development Board, and I'm not sure what that entity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| I think we have control over it, but they're at Paper Mill and I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| Even though there's nearby residential, it's multifamily and a sign of that size would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| I looked further, and Karen has some of them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| The institutional zones that are not on a federally designated highway are adjacent to residential are schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:11| The two that I found that are not county schools are Knoxville College and St. Joseph's School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:24| They would be restricted to a sign of 10 feet in height and 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| which seems appropriate for acreages or lots of more than five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| because that's the threshold that staff use for designating a school or a church institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:44| I would like to hear from Ms. Feld and see what the concern is because I couldn't see an issue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:53| because we don't regulate most of those institutional zones that are adjacent to residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| we don't have the authority to regulate the size, placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| or anything else that happens on them because of their exemption from local zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| I'll be trying to identify the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| I appreciate the interest in you being here and getting a lesson in civics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| and I am here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| I hope you're all awake enough to follow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| I'm not sure I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| But anyway, Scenic Knoxville does not support the planning staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| that no revisions be made to the signed standards for properties zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| According to planning staff, and as stated in your agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| when designating properties for institutional zoning on the new zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| the minimum acreage that was used as a guide, not a standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| but a guide for these designations was five acres, as Mr. Green just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| Properties zoned institutional are described, again from your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| as large, complex, and a campus-like setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Your packet also states that planning staff has since conducted research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| using the properties that have been zoned institutional, and Mr. Green just reviewed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| And so I'm going to say, and the conclusion was that most of these properties would be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| for a 10-foot tall, 100-square foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| And staff concluded, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| this sign size is appropriate for properties with a minimum size of five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| which is the threshold for schools and churches to be designated institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| There are several problems with this conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| First of all, Article 8 of the new zoning code introduces the institutional district in Section 8.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5396)|
| 1:30:05| In Section 8.2a, the purpose statement states that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| in addition to medical centers and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| this designation can be used for professional offices or business uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| that are compatible with the character of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| Currently, properties zoned office in the office zone are allowed a maximum of a six-foot monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:29| According to the arguments made here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| offices located adjacent to a residential district that are zoned institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| would likely be allowed a 10-foot, 100-square foot detached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| It does not make sense that office space located within a residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| or adjacent or surrounded by a residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| is allowed larger signage than office space located in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| More importantly, in Table 8.2 of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| and I know you can't read this, but I am going to pass on a copy of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| The minimum lot area is specified as 20,000 square feet in Table 8.2, or less than half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:21| Nowhere does it specify a minimum lot size of five acres as a standard or a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| I wouldn't characterize a half-acre lot as large, complex, and a campus-like setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| Half-acre lots abutting or surrounded by a residential zone would closely abut single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| or a 10-foot tall, 100-square foot sign would be unattractive and inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| Signed standards for these properties should be the same as those adopted for the new zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| Neighborhood Non-Residential Reuse, as listed in Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| I'm not going to read those to you, but they will be attached to my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| For properties of three acres or more, detached signs should be limited to monument signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| that are no more than four feet tall and 32 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| This is appropriate for a residential zone, not a 10-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| There are also no stated standards for attached signs or wall signs, and these also need to be specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5544)|
| 1:32:33| For smaller properties, we're recommending that standards should follow those of the Neighborhood Non-Residential Reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:41| For properties of three acres or more, attached signs should match the standards in office zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:50| which is 5% of the square footage of the primary facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| The sign ordinance that passed in 2015 took over three years to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| I represented Scenic Knoxville on the City Council Sign Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| and I'm very well acquainted with the process and the resulting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| Maximum sign heights and sizes were of great concern to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| and were carefully studied and widely debated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| and that's an understatement for those of you who may have been here when we went through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| I think the sign ordinance came through this commission four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| The ordinance includes specific standards based on roadway type and the zone where the property is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| and City Council determined that these—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Excuse me, Ms. Feld, are you about to wrap up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Yeah, I'm going to wrap up if I can have a few more sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| —are optimal for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| This new zone should be no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Specific sign standards should be codified for properties zoned institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| that are adjacent to or surrounded by a residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| to ensure that they fit in with the character of a residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| and do not risk lowering the property values of the surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| One more sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| We are requesting that a moratorium on new institutional district designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| within residential zones should be put in place until satisfactory sign standards can be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| Ms. Green, before I go to Commissioner Clancy, do you have anything that you'd like to say on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| I appreciate Ms. Feld's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| They're all speculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| What I base my recommendation on are the existing institutional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| not the ones that may be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| I can't imagine staff recommending approval of a half acre for the institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| in the middle of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| If this commission recommends that and the City Council approves that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| I think that's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| I do think that what we have now is a solution looking for a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| and we don't have a problem based on the information I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| Those properties zoned institutional, the vast majority of them are not subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:26| Let me step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Zoned institutional and surrounded by residential are not subject to our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| The few that are, again, I don't think a 10-foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| and 100 square feet on a 5-acre property is out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| It is a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| It's not a standard, but if you look at the institutional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| they're all large acreages, large campus-like environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| and for the most part not subject to the City's zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Following up on this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| the analysis that was done by the staff looking at 16 parcels proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:14| adopted under RECODE to be zoned institutional came under the threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| the guideline that was put in place by MPC staff of being 5 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| but that's not what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| The law says a half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| An analysis was done, and then MPC says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| we think on these parcels bigger signs under the commercial and industrial sign code make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| Of course they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| They selected the parcels, MPC staff did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| the parcels that were proposed to be zoned in RECODE as institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| Come January 1, anyone with half an acre can come forward and request institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:07| Institutional zone is not just for large government offices or schools or churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| It's also for small offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| What we're building in is an incentive to go with the institutional zone over an office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| because the sign standards are twice what they would be allowed in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:33| Ms. Malone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| what I'm hearing is that you're supposing some things that might happen down in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:45| with regards to institutional zones that were not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| Do we not have in RECODE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| The institutional zone does not exist now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| The institutional zone exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| The zoning map and the zoning ordinance were adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| They're no longer RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| They're the new city of Knoxville zoning ordinance and zoning map to become effective January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| So do they have standards, these zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Right now, there are no institutional zones except the ones handpicked and put on the RECODE map by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| There is no institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| The map was approved by city, recommended by this commission, and approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| And they came under a five-acre threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| That is not what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| The law says 20,000 square feet, less than half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| Yes, I'm looking at what could happen because that's what the law says can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:48| And we have no experience with this zone because it does not presently exist in our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| So what's the worst case thing that could happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| You end up with a tail wagging the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Those who would like larger signs go in and request an institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| A request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Request an institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| Come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| Maybe it's denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| It's appealed to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| And there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Ms. Malone, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| We did give Ms. Feld extra time on her presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| I believe that with regards to institutional zones, Mr. Green has already assured us that there is regulations with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:33| I would like to go to commission and hear from Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| If I could say one thing, I will submit material for the record, and I want to make it very clear that it's now 4.58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| I've been here since 1.30, and I appreciate the opportunity to participate in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Can we give Ms. Malone additional time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| She's very knowledgeable on zoning, and I'd like to hear her comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| How much time would you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Two minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| We agree with Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| I'm here on behalf of the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| We think there ought to be sign provisions for the various uses that are allowed in the proposed institutional zone that will go into effect on January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:33| similar to the scheme that's in place regarding signage in the residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| where the signs for apartments are obviously larger than the signs for a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| We think it's appropriate that hospitals and larger complexes have larger signs, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| but that's different from a 20,000-square-foot lot with a doctor's office on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| The institutional zone, as I said, allows for more than just government offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| I think what has happened is this stuff has not been clearly sorted out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| because if you look at the original recode draft that came out in March of 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| there was no institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| There was no office park zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| There was an OI zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| The next draft that came out a few months later got rid of the OI zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| came up with the office park zone, the OP zone, and the institutional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| and there's a lot of overlap between these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| Again, this was an enormous project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| Some things got by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| What we're asking for now is a correction that would take into consideration what will happen in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| based on what is proposed, what is adopted, and is part of the zoning code at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| I was here when the sign ordinance was being debated over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:19| Part of the problem with government and all these rules, you can't legislate every scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:28| I mean, you just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Ms. Malone comes as close to anybody as I've ever known that could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| but every single scenario can't be accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| I think the sign ordinance, Ms. Felt, you put countless hours in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:45| When it passed, not only was I happy that it was over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| but I thought that we had done the best we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| I thought we had addressed as many of Scenic Knoxville's concerns, the sign company's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6173)|
| 1:43:02| I thought we really hit a good hard line on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| For that reason, I'm opposed to any amendment coming through that is such a broad stroke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| I know we're getting ready to get institutional zones with new recode and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6196)|
| 1:43:24| but I think that a lot of that has oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| and I think a lot of it comes here to this body to make a recommendation to make Knoxville a livable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:36| I think most of the people on this board and most of the people on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| that's Knox County's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| That's what they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| So I'm going to make a motion that the sign ordinance not be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| to identify specific sign standards for the institutional zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Second by, I was going to say Commissioner Boyer because she doesn't second very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| And you both said it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| I understand the concerns that have been brought before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| and I too have concerns if institutional is allowed for smaller parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| and if that can include offices or other types of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| And we acknowledge that the new zoning code is a living document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| and that we were probably going to see things as we go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| that are going to need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| And I think that this is one of the first that's been brought to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| that needs to be looked at a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| But I don't think it's necessarily a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| Well, it's related to a change in the signage ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| but I think it's really making sure that the new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| and the signage ordinance mesh together and work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| So I feel like I'd like staff to have some more time to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| one more time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| I'm going to go out on a limb and say that we've got a lot more things to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| than to rehash this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| The onus is on this commission and the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| We have a hierarchy of zones, office, office, park, institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| And, again, if this commission recommends approval of a half acre for institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| then that's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| I understand the concerns that in a neighborhood you shouldn't have large signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| Well, don't zone a half acre parcel in the middle of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| Institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Again, the larger signs are appropriate for a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| One of the concerns we've heard from hospitals under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| was that the signage standards are too tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| So the purpose of the institutional zone is for large campus-like facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| larger schools, and there's institutional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| What we have to look at is how to most efficiently address these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| I think we have them by the hierarchy of zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Yes, offices are permitted in the institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| That's because next to hospitals you have doctor's offices, rehab offices, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| But the middle of the neighborhood is not the place for the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| I think I can't remember if Ms. Malone or Ms. Feld said we're getting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| Your approach is getting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| Suddenly we're going to start zoning because someone wants a larger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| We're going to start zoning half acre parcels in the middle of the neighborhood institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| Well, if we do, shame on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| There's another way and a better way to address this concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| than to spend countless hours, because that's what it would get into, amending the sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| I have another question, ladies and gentlemen, from the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Is it appropriate to ask the Stakeholder Committee with the new zoning code to look at the institutional zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| The representative from the Planning Commission on the Stakeholder Committee is Vice Chair Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:10| and he could bring that request to the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| That may be the appropriate place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Do we want to postpone this vote and take it before the Stakeholder Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| Maybe another thing is just that may be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:35| We don't do substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| We do not do substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| Bob's rules, remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| I think that's right, Bob's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| I mean, are we thinking that somebody's going to pick institutional zoning to get a little bit larger sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| It just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Again, I think if that request is before this commission, and this commission recommends approval of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| then shame on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| Ms. Feld, do you have something really quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| With all due respect, why does it not say minimum lot area five acres in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| that you don't expect small parcels to be rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| And also, I can trust you, I can trust this body as constituted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| I do not know who will be on this body in five years or ten years, and you know you won't be here in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:31| And I probably won't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| Have you guys started on that bike lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Have you guys started on that bike lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| But the minimum lot size says 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| Because think of Fort Sanders Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| The zoned area is about five acres, but there are lots within that zoned area for a medical office that are half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:56| If we started limiting the lot area to five acres or expanding it to five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| then we would make a huge number of existing lots nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| Within a zoned district, it's not just one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| And in fact, going further, if one lot came in for institutional zoning, that would be spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| which would be a further challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| But within each zone, there are a number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| For example, in any of our districts, we have a minimum lot size, but the area of that entire zone is much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:33| Because even in the residential zone, the minimum lot size for RM1 is 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| but we don't state that the zoning district can be 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| Lots within that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| So it's breaking down that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| I guess I just don't understand why you resist setting standards based on lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6591)|
| 1:50:00| I think that maybe the motion that would be appropriate would be that the sign task force be reconstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:11| And the sign task force, if it gets into that level of detail, that's beyond, I think, what we'd want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| So I would recommend a motion that we recommend to the city council that they reconstitute the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:26| I don't even know if all those people exist anymore, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| We do have a motion on the floor, and we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| I understand that perhaps there may be an alternate to postpone this for discussion by the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:51| No, the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| No, it's no longer recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| It's the zoning stakeholder, public stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| The motion was to not amend the signed standards for institutional zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| That was the motion, and you seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Oh, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| And that is the motion that we are voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| If you guys would prefer deferring this, then you would vote no on this motion and allow another motion to be presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:31| But currently we've got a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| This was on consent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| This was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6700)|

| 1:52:27| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Mr. Roth is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Mr. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| It's not a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| What was it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| Nine to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| Nine to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Because we lost one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| So that moves us on to agenda item number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| Which is the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| And this, I'll try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| I spoke to this at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| And this is the provision that allows, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| city council member asked us to look at the provision that allows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| planning commission to approve additional signage in certain commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| That provision is in the current code for planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| We agreed not to change the sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| And so this provision was carried over to what were identified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| comparable districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| And there are standards for approving additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| And in the four and a half years since the adoption of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| ordinance, one request has come before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| So it's not abused or used inappropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| The staff recommends no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Carly Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| We ask that you vote to delete this provision from the city sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| regulations that will go into effect on January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| What is proposed would allow approval of additional signs by the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| commission in the proposed non-planned zones of CG, CH, CR, IRD, and IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:22| And there is no limit placed on the number of additional signs that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| A similar, but not the same, a similar provision exists in the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| But it applies only to planned zones, specifically cited as planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| commercial one and two, shopping center one, two, and three, business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| park and industrial one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| In the existing zoning ordinance, it does not apply to non-planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| And the new ordinance that takes effect January 1 does not have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| So what RICO does with this provision is substitute non-planned zones of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:14| general commercial, highway commercial, CR, IRD, IG for the planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| As you know, there's a big difference between planned zones and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| non-planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| The big difference, of course, is use on review, the ability to condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| the requirement of a public hearing, the ability to look at a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| plan that shows the relationship of all of the buildings and the entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| and the yards to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| None of that is available in a non-planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| So in other words, why is there a problem with applying the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:50| give additional signs to a non-planned zone when it's maybe appropriate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| a planned zone is because the planned zone provides both the context and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| process for considering additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| And that is not provided in the non-planned zones that will take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:13| on January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| Now, you're told that there are very few requests for additional signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| one in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| I think Mr. Green recently quoted, be aware of the fact that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| relatively few planned commercial zones in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| You can count them probably on 10 or 12 fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| How many shopping centers, SC1s, 2s, and 3s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| How many planned commercial 1s and 2s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| How many BPs are you aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| It's very different when you apply this additional, the ability to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| additional signs in everything that is presently zoned C3 and C4, which line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| Broadway, Kingston, Pike, Magnolia, and all the rest of our major thoroughfares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| So to say there's only been one in 10 years, when there's only a handful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| is perhaps not a good predictor of how many requests will be coming in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| future when this is applied to every, literally every commercial zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| now exists, except for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| Also, the provision says that additional signs may be necessary because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| unusual topography, and that additional signs are essential to inform and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| direct the public due to building locations, relationships, or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| with multiple structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| If additional signs are needed because of topography, that's why there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| If additional signs are needed due to, quote, building locations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| relationships or developments with multiple structures, additional signs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| then essential to inform and direct the public, end quote, why not consider the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| master signed provision for unified developments, section 13.7 in the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| zoning code that's available in both the existing and new sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:25| For these reasons, we ask that this provision be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| I'm going to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Scenic Knoxville urges that the language allowing additional signs in the CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| CH, CR, IRD, and IG zones be struck from the zoning ordinance, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:50| take effect on January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| I would like to draw your attention again to the 2015 sign ordinance, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| I know Mr. Clancy went through and was adopted after more than three years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:06| study and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Not only were strict standards included for sign height and size, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| mentioned previously, but the number of additional signs and their sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| allowed in commercial and industrial zones was also discussed at length and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| clearly specified in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| How many signs you can have doesn't just happen to be sitting there on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7168)|

| 1:59:40| drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| To now allow additional signs in these districts without first delineating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| specific standards whereby they can be approved defeats the intent of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7186)|

| 1:59:53| As Ms. Malone said, I also believe that this is an issue that requests for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| additional signs should go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| Furthermore, I'm not an attorney, but I have received the opinion of a former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| municipal attorney, and it's her feeling that this language before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| potentially violates Tennessee Code Annotated 13-7207, which specifies the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| powers of Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| In this attorney's opinion, Tennessee law requires decisions about additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| signs in these zones to be made by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| We agree that that's the correct process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| I also remember the one time that we did have a request for additional signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| and that was for Duluth trading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| Indeed, it was discussed amongst this body for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| We didn't make that decision lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| It was not something that was just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| The commission deliberated quite some time on that, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:11| Thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Does anyone from commission have anything that they would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| Mr. Green, would you like to address anything at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| I appreciate both Ms. Malone and Ms. Mills' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| One comment about in plan districts, we see the plan for the entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:34| Yes, we do, but often not with the sign request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| Under the provisions set forth in the existing code and the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| one of the requirements is not to detract from the character of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| or surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Well, we need to look at the development, the entire development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| so we have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| But the development plan clearly shows that because of unusual topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| building locations, and relationships of development with multiple structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| additional signs are essential to inform and direct the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| And we'd look not just at the sign by itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| but in context with the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| So it would be an application and review that incorporates an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:18| of the entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| I trust this commission to make good decisions on when additional signs are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| Again, we just, as staff, we're charged with not changing the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| and incorporating all the provisions, and that's what we tried to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| So whatever your direction is, we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| Oh, was that an accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Is that your chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Oh, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| It was your chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| I think your chair wanted to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| Make a motion that the sign ordinance not be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Easton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| that the sign ordinance not be amended with regards to the additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:10| in commercial and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| Don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| We are on to agenda item number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| Carlene and Joyce, thank you for bringing these to the attention of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| Appreciate your watching out for this, and I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| And I am assuming that, Joyce, you're going to email to us your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| Yeah, email them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| I'd be interested in reading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| Madam Chair, we're at almost 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| We've been at this now for four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| I think everybody's getting a little bit tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| I would make a motion that we postpone item 42 until the December meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| if staff is comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| I don't know if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| I have no comments to make on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| I'm ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| Yeah, I think the chairperson needs to bring it to our attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| and put it on the table so we can vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| Vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Let's go forward then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| We're on to agenda item number 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| consideration of an established process for initiating and undertaking a zoning study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| And, Mr. Green, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| No comments other than those made at the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| I would just ask that we consider raising the bar to 75% rather than 60% as the threshold on both ends of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7496)|
| 2:05:05| on the consideration, and then on the final vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| because it may look a little different from when it started to when it ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| And staff, if it's not agreeable to that change, that would assure firm support for the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| These items are big deals within a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| When you start changing lot widths and things of that nature, going from 75 feet to 100 feet, design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:31| and I think it needs to be more than just a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| I think it needs to be an overwhelming majority or at least a super majority of 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| So, with that, I'll make a motion with the 75% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Uden, but we still have a light on or a non-light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| No light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| I think Art pulled that light from my table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| I have to disagree with Commissioner Hill's 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:06| I only know of one instance where anybody requires 75%, and that's amending the U.S. Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:15| Everything else is done by majority rule except the override of a presidential veto at two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7575)|
| 2:06:24| So, if we want to encourage community neighborhoods to get involved in their communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| I think a 75% rule is just going to create nobody getting anything accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:38| I mean, can you imagine in this commission we require 75% of the people voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| Out of 15 members, 12 of you would have to vote for something to get that kind of support in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:51| I mean, if you look at our politics, we can't get 50-50, Arlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| So, I mean, I think all we're doing is creating a situation where nobody's going to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| It's going to be discouraging to community, to neighborhoods, and I oppose the 75% category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:07| I think staff had it right at 60%, and I think that's the way it should stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7627)|
| 2:07:13| Commissioner Easton, I don't know if it's still the case, so it may not be that we do it this way anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| but back when I know when my neighborhood was forming a historic overlay or neighborhood conservation overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:30| they used to require that the neighborhoods had consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| And I don't remember the percentage, but it was not just a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| It was 75-80% of the neighborhood had to be in agreement before you could get that overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| I don't know if that's the case now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| That's not the case, and we look back at some of those past histories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| and that supermajority was required sometimes, and not with all overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| And what we're trying to do is a consistent approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| And I appreciate Commissioner Phillips' concerns about not getting agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7680)|
| 2:08:07| but I've also seen where when we don't have that supermajority, it evolves pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:14| So I'm comfortable with whatever direction the commission provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:22| Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| I'm almost a little more protective of staff's time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| I mean, if you've got a 75% group that says they want to do this, then to allocate staff's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7709)|
| 2:08:37| sometimes I don't know, Gerald, how long these zoning studies last, but they could go on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| They could go to city council and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| They could go to county commission and come back two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| We're talking about a lot of staff allocated time and dollars to these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| and I would want to make sure that we have a good participation agreement before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7732)|
| 2:09:02| So I do think that the higher percentage makes more sense just for staff's time and everybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:12| I'd like to weigh in on this just from perspective of being a president of a neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:20| and our neighborhood has 600 residents in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| and we have about 30 that are members or come to meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| and thinking of trying to do something with 600 residents that a lot of them are landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7770)|
| 2:09:39| that are out of state and not available to contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:49| I think that if we're going with 75%, then there would need to be some sort of reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:57| if there is no contact from someone, it's kind of like if we abstain, it's a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| I'd like to see some sort of reference in here, if we're going with the higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| that we say if we have not heard from this person after X amount, then that means that they don't object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:15| So does that make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| I just don't want it to be stonewalled, or not stonewalled, but stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| because you can't get to that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| Pat, I appreciate what you have to say about 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| Our neighborhood went through this, and it seems like it's been like 70 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:42| but Ann Bennett came, and we said, we think we have a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| and she said, I don't care about a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| She said, if I don't have most of the people in your neighborhood that want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| don't waste my time, because it is a waste of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| This is something that sets up to protect neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| to keep them the way that the people in the neighborhood all want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| If you can't all get on the same page, don't waste my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| Take your chances with the zoning and uses on reviews and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:19| I tend to agree with Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| It's a time management thing, and if you raise the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| our staff is going to have more time with the people that are really serious about doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| The neighborhood's all on board, and it's not going to take three years to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| So I can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| I think I can support it, but I do appreciate what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| All right, so did you – yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| A couple more comments, because I think they're important comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| and I know what I'm about to say is that was then and this is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| but when Mr. Donaldson was in that seat and we went through this in Old Westmoreland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| he represented that we needed 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| I think 75% is important because we've gone through recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| and we've had those 100-plus meetings and all the public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| and for someone who buys into a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| So that's the bigger protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| But when you're going to take the change and someone buys into a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| and then all of a sudden a number of people want to make a change, I don't think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| And I think it should be extra protected, and for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| that's why I'm strongly encouraging and asking you to consider 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| And maybe I can amend it, Madam Chair, to the participating voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| and not just the landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| So I think it's important in the process that our planning department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| that, one, they set it out on the right track to ask the right questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| instead of things like when people are fighting over speed-ups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| they ask a question, do you want your child safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| And then if you do, then you're for speed-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| And those are important questions is how you frame this within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| So that's all I've got to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| But you didn't amend your motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| I would ask you, Madam Chair, would you like for me to amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| Can you hold just one moment? I'd like to hear from Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| So protocol, Mr. Wise, Attorney, when one does a neutral vote, an abstention is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:32| Right? That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| That means you're voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| If I don't vote, that doesn't mean I'm voting for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| And I think that is what the public policy norm is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| that if I don't respond, my answer is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| I think it's going to be hard to say that you have the spirit of your original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| It's hard to say that that is the result of that occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| if you just assume everyone who doesn't vote is a yes in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| You've just obliterated wanting to get consensus of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| So I think those are contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| In terms of the comment about staff time, I think staff has evaluated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| and I think they see the value at 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| And overriding staff in this course I don't see as beneficial to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8063)|
| 2:14:30| Mr. Wise, going back to my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| A lot of these communities have lost the R1E zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| They didn't get an opportunity to vote, but they've been in effect for maybe 20, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8076)|
| 2:14:43| All this is doing is allowing them to come back to us, to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| and it still has to be approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| All it takes is a majority of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| So I think there's enough safety nets there between that 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| to keep anything coming in that's going to be contradictory to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| Do you care to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| So what is your current motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| It is the recommendation except for the 60 and the exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| Insert 75% as the threshold to evaluate and then 75% to the ultimate approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:30| Did you say something about the property owners or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| Well, it looked by the nods within my colleagues here that they didn't want me to amend the motion, so I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| And so, Commissioner Rutan, you still second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8149)|

| 2:16:07| Commissioner Canty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part2?start=8167)|
