| 0:03:00| with half a day for students on Monday, August 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=180)|

| 0:03:10| We're really excited to get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| So do we have any requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| I would like to make a motion for possible action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| on the superintendent evaluation timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Just a point, do we want to add this as an item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| or do you want to go ahead and make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| I would like to add the item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| So do you want to add it at the end of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Let me do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| I also have a second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Ms. Spab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Yeah, I was just going to, let me rephrase that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| take that motion away because we're not discussing it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| I just want to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| Can you re-read what I'm trying to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Are you withdrawing your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| No, I want it just on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| So for changes to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Ms. Satterfield would like to add possible action on the superintendent's evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| and then I believe she has a second item to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| And we're going to add that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| And then the vote will be on the agenda itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| So for adding the superintendent timeline to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=285)|

| 0:07:55| I'm just serving alongside you and getting to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=475)|

| 0:08:13| But I do appreciate you and your friendship and your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=493)|

| 0:25:01| plan and what its capabilities are and why we're moving, why you're suggesting we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| toward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Good evening, Madam Chairperson, and good evening to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| It's my pleasure to come here and finally be able to start talking about the reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| because I know we've gotten halfway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| We're now in phase two of that reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| And this software package is the main focus of everything that's going to ride on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| phase two portion of our reorganization, which includes a modernization piece to move towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| a data-driven model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| So I just wanted to kind of lay out what 365 Labs is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| It seems very ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| And I know there was some confusion over what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I just wanted to rest assure you that this is not a black mystery box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| It is a software package that essentially is a records management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| 365 Labs is a software suite that will host on-premises, that will convert all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| current library of incident reports and numbering 14,000 or so into a new system, digitizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| in effect those reports, keeping them secure, and putting them on a new system that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| do much more advanced analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| The catalyst for this change was immediately upon arrival, I was told that the old software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| that our system rides on is a local software that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| It's a proprietary system that we built with another partner in the department in culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| school culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| And the system has now run its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| It is basically not supported by the software manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So this was inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| We had to move to this new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| It's going to be highly secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| It's two-factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| We're going to tier access to only those who need to see the PII that will be storing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| And essentially what the system is, is any incident that occurs at any school, our security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| officers use this system to fill out an incident report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| The incident report is based on best practices under the criminal justice information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| All of the data collection is basically standardized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| It's used by all law enforcement and security organizations around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| And it will be stored on premises in a highly secure system that only we will manage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| our IT department will manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I actually involved IT and legal in this through the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| We made sure that this company followed all those best practices, and we were happy with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| the results that we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| I wanted to first say what the added capabilities will do besides the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| So the software was important, moving to that new software capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| What is advanced analytics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Everybody talks about that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Advanced analytics is making sure that we have true data-driven operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Instead of just putting a flat amount of security everywhere, we want to actually drive our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| resources where they're supposed to be and hopefully prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| That's the gold standard, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Prevention over mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| But as a fallback is mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| So moving resources where they need to be based on the driving analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Some of that would be trend analysis that you use in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Some of it would be predictive analytics where we start to put resources ahead of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| problems that are starting to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| And then there's other things such as link analysis where we try to see if there's links| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| to two things that are happening, much like we do in the research method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| So these things will exponentially increase our abilities to put people and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| and assets and focus on the right places so we're not just throwing people out into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| districts and just saying, we'll put this number of people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| So it's going to be a much smarter way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| It's going to empower those incident reports to be done quicker, more efficiently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| faster reporting, officer safety standards because the smartphones that we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| issuing out this week will tie into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| It'll be mobile capable, which means the officer can put information in real time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| take photos, send video to our dispatch, and we can actually up the officer's safety posture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| and the safety of the school because we'll be getting data in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| And we can then share that data with our law enforcement partners if needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| if we needed a response from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| And then also we went to an app-based system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| So both on the computer-aided dispatching side where we can dispatch people quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| and push resources out, it actually tracks them, creates this big system where we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| all the pieces on the board and we can move people around in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| We can triage those people, make sure they're put in the right places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and then also our information will be more secure in the end because we're actually putting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| on a military-grade encrypted system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| I've got just a few questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| I think, I mean, that brings a lot more clarity to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Records management system can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| So does this system itself do the analytics or is that going to be a separate system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| or is this just mainly for storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| It actually has on-platform advanced analytics, so a lot of those analytical tools are built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| but some of them can be built with our partners at 365 Lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| But it's doing analytics based on incident reports that we enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| This is not curating social media and things like that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Yes, it is basically in real time and then historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| And are we storing different information in here than what's in our current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| or are we basically just moving to a new system to store the same types of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| but we can just do more with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| We're actually just storing the exact same information because there's actually a standardization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| called NIBRS that we have to follow and that the storing and aggregation of that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| needs to be formatted in such a way so that it actually makes sense from a governmental standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| It'll be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| And so this system will just be private to our security department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Now, we could share information with law enforcement agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| but they don't have direct access to the system, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| And data will only go in the system predicated by an incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| so we will not be data mining or doing anything as a matter of practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| We'll be only putting information as incidents occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| The one word that you said that really stuck with me is the word prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Can you speak just a few more moments to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| and why that's so important in the work that you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and the work that we need to see happen within Knox County schools from a security standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| It goes to saying that the old model of security was you put a certain level of security posture out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| to mitigate as best you can the threats that we've analyzed in our risk analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| What we've done over the past 30 years in the security industry has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| data-driven model says that you put people where the problems are as they're starting to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| so that they don't get as serious as they usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| So you actually prevent those really bad incidents from happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| by diverting those people off of the course of violence or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| criminality they were getting involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| The idea is to identify problems as they start to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| or even before they occur with the predictive model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| to put the resources there to actually prevent it from happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| because we know there's a psychological component to most criminality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| that says that if there's something that's easy to do and it becomes a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| that's where they'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| If we create a hard target, they move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Well, I appreciate you and your expertise, and I'm certainly not a law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| I got to ride along with a lot of them over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| I'm coming more from a social work background and kind of social service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| and I can tell you that prevention in almost any industry is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| If we can prevent things from happening that shouldn't be happening, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| So I appreciate you taking that philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| and trying to get us to the place where we can do more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| I think there's going to continue to be pertinent questions about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| because there's all kinds of issues that get raised around privacy concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and if you're targeting people and flagging folks and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| I'm not hearing that in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| but I do think those types of questions are going to be important as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| I know you're conscious about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| but I think it's something that the public is going to want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| in terms of how, as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| what things might we be getting ourselves into that's unintended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| And as you and I talked in private, I've met with several local groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| and I address their concerns any time they have questions about what we're putting in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| and I want to make sure that that door is always open to those folks who have concerns for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| because it's my responsibility to make sure I de-conflict any bad information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and make sure that you guys know that we're really trying to be an honest broker here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| and try to keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Which speaks, again, to your prevention philosophy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| You want to deflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Yeah, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2044)|

| 0:34:06| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Yeah, I just had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Are there other school systems that are using this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Contractually, I can't tell you who they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| but I can tell you that we've confirmed that other school systems have used this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| the same system, successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Okay, and that's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| You've probably vetted it with the ones that have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| If you can't share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I'm assuming you all feel this is the best system for what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Yes, ma'am, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Okay, so any more questions for Chief Perriard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2083)|

| 0:34:57| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2097)|

| 0:37:56| I move a motion regarding the superintendent evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| In light of new information received from the Knox County Law Department, I make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| for the board to adopt the superintendent search committee's recommendation that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| framework developed over the last two months be used as a guide for further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| and collaboration with the superintendent, with Superintendent Reiswick at the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| annual workshop in September 2022, and the final evaluation tool to be presented for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| adoption at the board's October 2022 meeting to utilize for the superintendent's annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| evaluation in January 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I just wanted to ask our superintendent, since this is his evaluation, does his timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| do you have any thoughts on this presentation of motion as far as moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| No, I think it does align with the language in my contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| I know we've talked through that as well, and I think that was the intent of that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| we can bring it annually to September's board retreat when we have that to talk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| and come up with those metrics, and I think that would align well, and I think the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| has in October through, I think October 15th, the deadline for that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| So I think it aligns with what the contract says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| I agree with the recommendation, and I think it makes sense for us to look at that annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| and I'm sure that's why we ended up putting that in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| The question I have is, when it references the superintendent search committee's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| I know there was multiple drafts, there was at least two drafts, and then also the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| was asked to send in additional items between the last meeting and now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| I just want to know what's going to be done with that, and is that going to come to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| meeting to discuss in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| What is the official recommendation, I guess, is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Yes, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| So the recommendation from the committee is to take all the responses that Terry received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| and add to your annual workshop in September, and decide how you want to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| So it's already compiled in that packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| So it's the curated, it's the responses curated from all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Because we didn't, given the information we received, we couldn't no longer do the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| Yeah, thank you, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| And I don't think it makes sense to put this in the motion, because it's really asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| individual board members to take the initiative, which I don't think we need to make formal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| but I would encourage each of us to, you know, nine months or so from now, to do some official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| check-ins with Dr. Ryswick, since it is going to be 18 months out before the official evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| Obviously, nothing that we're bringing to the board as a whole, but just make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| we each take the time and opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| Okay, so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| We have one person signed up for a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Kim, if you could state your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| British, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| I'm Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Is there any possible way I can have you timed it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| And I can do an abridged version, but my husband's good with the stopwatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| I timed it four minutes and 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| I really like to read the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Is there any process by which I can do that, since I'm the only one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Anybody want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| I move to extend the public forum speaking time with one presenter for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| So a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Spav to extend it to like five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| I'll be under five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| Once you do it for one person, you've established a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| And, I mean, you know, we only have this one person today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| You know, they could speak for ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| But if you go over the three minutes, what are you going to do the next time you have 25 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2545)|
| 0:42:35| We make these rules for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| Ms. Credix, just to clarify, you were signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| And we canceled one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| And then one got so delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| We had a college friend in who had an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| And so I did not speak at the last two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I knew you were signed up to speak at the meeting that was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Spav.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2583)|
| 0:43:16| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Ms. Spav?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| That's five yes votes, one no vote, and three pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Ms. Owen, did you want to change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Ms. Bounds, did you want to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| I'm sorry, Ms. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| So the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Kim Kredich, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| I emailed school board members prior to the July meetings to let you know the good news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| regarding TISA as it relates to special education funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| After decades of a faulty state funding mechanism that, against a specific provision in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, incentivized unnecessarily restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| segregated placement, it looks like TISA, admittedly with its shortfalls, got at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| one thing right by fixing this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| So no more can claims of, we don't have the funding to do inclusion, be the district's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| excuse to violate students' rights to inclusive education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Please note that I include all students in that statement, not just students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| Decades of studies show that students without disabilities benefit just as much, if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| more, from being educated alongside their peers who have disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| Test scores, problem solving, empathy, all are positively affected for students without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| disabilities when educated in inclusive classroom environments through appropriate supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| and services for their peers who have disabilities and supports and training for their general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| education teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Again, I ask you to consider this month's Syracuse University-based inclusive schooling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| workshop and district licensure so that all district employees can access the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| and resources from this four-day event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Our three sons, who attended Sequoia, Vine, and West, our youngest also attended 7th and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| 8th grade at Beard and Middle, are now in their 20s, and two are out of college and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| So I have no kids in Knox County School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| But looking at our tax dollars from a Knox County perspective, I remain aghast at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| much money is spent by our county on education-related court losses and settlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| The Knox County Law Department started sending attorneys to IEP meetings where parents were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| not legally represented in the spring of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Since that time, around 10 times the number of due process filings over IDEA and ADA cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| have occurred and have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses and settlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Well, when the school district lawyers up and the parent is treated so unprofessionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| and disrespectfully at meetings, oftentimes mocked by the law department attorney attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| the IEP meeting, parents decide to lawyer up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And they win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| They win through settling for what was originally proposed by the parent in an IEP meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| like music therapy, in-person services during COVID operational closures, placement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| general education classroom with appropriate supplemental supports like services of a TA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| and resource pull-out or push-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Then some also get compensatory education in the form of, say, $11,000 or $18,000 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| two such cases in an education account for the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| The parent's attorneys get their fees at around $400 per hour, paid for by the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| or Knox County, totaling tens of thousands and sometimes into the hundreds of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Besides the $145,000 settlement over last year's very public ADA case, where is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| outrage over the last three years of monetary losses and settlements over IDEA and ADA cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| alleging violation of our school board's own special education and discrimination-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| What I have come to realize is that since the losses and settlements don't hit the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| board budget, nobody seems to notice or care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| But it is still taxpayer money, and most importantly, it is still signaling the lack of implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| of our policy protecting the rights of all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| New data just in, Knox County has once again, for the ninth year in a row, failed to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| its meager inclusion target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| The needle has not moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| In fact, we went the opposite direction from the year prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| But the good news is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220803?start=2865)|
