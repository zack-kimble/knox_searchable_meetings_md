| 2:08:43| That's going to be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| That's not use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Where do you have an EMC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| To a regulation that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| Okay, so individually talk to the law department about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| Okay, so now anything else on Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| Madam Mayor, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| And my question is, the language, is this up to the legal department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| or is it up to council to go with the legal language of each one of these sections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| Because if it is, we'll be here all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| which I don't mind if that's what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| But I don't know that council can go over each one of these and go over the legal language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7760)|
| 2:09:28| I don't think we are qualified to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| Well, that's why I think they just referred, asked the law department to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| where there's ambiguity like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| They're asking the law department to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| understanding what the questions were that were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| And then they'll come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Okay, so anything else on 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| We're on 9, Section 9, Master Sign Plans for Unified Developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| Anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| I have a question, and that is in 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| It's not a development plan per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| but I heard Council King at the podium say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7804)|
| 2:10:12| and in his comments before MPC that are in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| there ought to be something that allows a hospital to submit a master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| or a site plan with signs different than what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| I don't know if that goes in 9 or some other place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| but the question is should they be allowed to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| rather than fight a BZA battle that they need to have an emergency sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| and an entrance sign and a whatever sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I think that's a standalone issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| We come back and talk about it months down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| I'm just saying 9 might be the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| Anything else for 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| We're on Section 10, Signs Permitted in All Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| Anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| Moving on to Section 11, Signs Permitted in Specific Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| We already had our one bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| Somewhere there was a concern that I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| Ms. Malone was the author of that, although she's in the back of the room distracted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| and that is that somehow we left out something about office zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| but I see 11.5 as speaking to 01, 02, and 03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| and allowing one detached sign of a certain size and one monument sign or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| So I don't understand what's missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| I'm not delusional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| I showed to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| You might be, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| I have an entirely different copy downloaded from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| My version is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| You didn't have the legal comments added in or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| I have what was on the MPC website with the same date considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| That version doesn't have that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| But it would satisfy you that we're limiting it to monument signs or column signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| and one detached sign, whether it's monument or column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Yeah, that's the one detached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| Yes, if that's what MPC voted on and that's what you guys are voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| but that's not what's in my copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| It's the MPC attachment called City Council Exhibit 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| and it's on page 320 in the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| I'll show you my copy from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| I think the question here is whether we want to talk about sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| I mean, that's the one thing we haven't talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| Now that you have defined the sign height, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| We did height, but we haven't done area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| We have done sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Now, I mean, we really couldn't talk about area until you talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| You're talking about 6D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| Is that the chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| 11.6D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| For the maximum sign area for primary detached signs, it will be 195 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| Do you have a proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| I'll defer to you, Mr. Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Which number are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| It's page 321.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| 11.6D, right underneath our heights, the height table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| Do you have that thing in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| I don't know if that was a recommendation or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| So what's the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| Is there a proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| Anything I would throw out would be totally random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| Can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Do we want to just amend section D, or do you want to add four different sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8024)|
| 2:13:51| sort of add a column to the chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| I think you want a separate column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8037)|
| 2:14:03| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| Mr. Greave, is that what came from the sound task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| What's listed in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| 95, 220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Is that something we've voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| I think what you're going back to is where we had the monument signs and the pole signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| and we had the heights as well as the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| That should be, that shows up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8063)|
| 2:14:30| With a 10-foot sign, you'd be hard-pressed to find 195 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| Well, with the change of height, see what the sign task force had was 40, 30, 30, 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| So then that was actually a 40% deduction from what was originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| and so that's how that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| Was that a mathematical relationship then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| We just divide by 35, 30, 20, and 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| In fact, it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8097)|
| 2:15:05| In other words, you'd be looking at a chart like this, so we need to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| Well, no, you don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| That chart is not part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| Well, it's based either on generally for any primary detached sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| except ones near an interstate, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| I mean, that's how it's divided under D, only two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| Near interstate exchanges, it's bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| In any other place, it has a maximum number for any size sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8134)|
| 2:15:52| What about something like 125, 100, 80, and 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| Aren't you going to have force areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| What was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| 125, 100, 80, and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| 125, 80?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| That's 4 by 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| 80?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| What was the second one, Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| I think 40 square feet of 10 by 4 sign is not very big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| Well, it's a 10 foot tall, so it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| I'm uncomfortable trying to figure this out on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| I'm sure there must be some statistical data out there that would suggest maximum sign height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| or sign areas for these heights that we've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| I would rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| Let's not make it too restrictive, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| We're going to kill business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| I'm uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| I can't see it in my mind's eye where this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| Well, you can't put 195 square feet on a 10 foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| Okay, so can somebody work on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| If you had a 10 foot by 10 foot, that would be 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| Well, what I'm saying is I know that the sign industry has some statistical data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| that might indicate the proper size signs for the height and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8229)|
| 2:17:16| I think what I looked at, Maryville's was 100 maximum and Oak Ridge's was 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| Those may be reversed, but that's the only information I really have on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| Is that something that has to be decided tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Is that something that has to be decided tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Charles, does that have to be decided tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| That's substantive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| That's pretty substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| If you're talking about the number of square feet of maximum area of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| that's going to be a substantive issue that if you change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| you're going to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| Now, it's something that was considered at MPC, so it won't have to go back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| but you'll either have to have two readings from when you change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| or you'll have to consider it on emergency, which you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| but with this ordinance, putting it on emergency seems probably not the thing you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8283)|
| 2:18:09| 100 and 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| Mayor, since we're talking about maximums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8292)|
| 2:18:20| and there's only two flavors in subpart D, I mean, we could have like a 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8300)|
| 2:18:27| since our sign went from 40 to 35 and, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| a slightly bigger one for the ones near the interstate, 500 linear feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| I mean, we could have two numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| It's a maximum, so I don't think we have to be ultra-restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| I think we just need to cap it somehow, and you ought to give the sign maker some leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| Now, maybe Dan Kelly has the absolute answer as he sits there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| but I would argue that we shouldn't be extremely restrictive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| We've lowered the height, but the design of the sign might take a different shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| that, you know, picks up a little area here and there for a very small sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| Let me interrupt here for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| Mr. Green, did you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| I just thought, and I'm new, so I'll take this with a grain of salt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| but I was talking with Jim here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| For example, all other roadway classifications reduce the height to one-third of what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| Why not take one-third of the maximum height, which would be about 64 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| go up to the next one, it's two-thirds, which would be two-thirds of 195.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| I don't have a calculator, but it's somewhere around, I would think, around 140 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| and just do it proportional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| It may be something that would have to be tweaked later as we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| but it's proportional to the height you have set and the changes, and it gets you through to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| So keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| That didn't have signs on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Wait, math and logic, why would we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| Just keep doing the math, Jim Hagerman, and tell us what those numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| We'll round it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| Round it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| The next one, and both the property adjacent to interstate right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| and property abutting a federally highway designated, let's say 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Next one down, coming all other roadway classifications, 10 feet, one-third of 195,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8416)|
| 2:20:23| 70 square feet, 75 square feet, and that's being a little bit generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| The first one is 35 square feet, which is, I'm trying to think, that's about 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| You may want to go down to 180 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| The top one, 180, 150, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| 180, 150, and 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8444)|
| 2:20:51| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| The 20-foot one, you have 150?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| Oh, it's 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| I'm a little bit nearsighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| I don't have my contacts in, so I thought it was 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| If it's a third less, it would be 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| 100, yeah, 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| So you have 180, 150, 175, is that what you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| I make a motion that we make the sign area 180 square feet from a property within 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8468)|
| 2:21:16| property adjacent, make it 150 square feet, property fronting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| federal designated highways, and make it 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| and the last designation, all other, would be 75 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| And that would be a table, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| That would be a table, much like what we've been playing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| Would you add to that that we would give some leeway to MPC if they have to play with this to actually check the math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8495)|
| 2:21:43| It gets it through, and then you can tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| I mean, you know, you've got to – that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| I have a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| Okay, so Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| You know, you're playing with something that none of us really know what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| There are proportions that go with heights, and sign companies have proportions that go with heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| What we need to do is we need to get the exact information in terms of what it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8525)|
| 2:22:10| instead of arbitrarily sitting here telling what they ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| So we know that this is in here and that what we ought to do is we ought to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| I assume, Counselor, that under this one, under the maximum sign heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| we'll get the proper information on whether that's a subsidence change or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| I don't think any of you folks, and I know I'm not an expert in knowing what proportions the sign face ought to be on top of pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| And so I think that we're being pretty arbitrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| and I don't think that's in the best interest of not only the sign ordinance but what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| So I'd recommend that we send this to get expert opinion on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| and send it back to the law department and have them deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| Well, is that a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| I mean, you've got to put some four numbers in there and then come back, and you can tweak it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| We already have something in there about signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| Well, answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| Mayor, let me suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| Actually, Councilman Starrick, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| I guess it's a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| The next reading, will we be able to change any numbers, or does that become a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| I have trouble answering the question if the question is any numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| because if it's just the slightest tweak of something, that might not be very substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| It just depends on whether it's substantive or whether it's clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| And it sounds like what you're talking about is substantive, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| When you add a whole set of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Yes, that's clearly substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| And this wasn't arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| It was actually proportional to what was already in here from my process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| But it may not be industry, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| It may not be an industry-capable standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| But it wasn't arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| I mean, it was proportional to what was in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| The sign task force didn't take any math to do it before, so, I mean, it was arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| But, well, can you take that piece and take it on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| Can you take that one section and say we're going to take sign area on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| and the rest of it on second vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Well, if you end up in a situation where you're comfortable with everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| and you're not making other substantive changes to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| and that's really the only thing that would require you to go to a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| then at that point you could make a motion to pass it on emergency if you wanted to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| if you didn't want to have to come back for another reading for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| if that's the only thing you're going to make a substantive change on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| So we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| If you want to do that, we could come back and look at it and take it on emergency if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| Why don't we just see if you've got the votes and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Well, I've got the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| Can I address the motion, which is why can't we simply adopt that D be converted to a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| and make it to reflect the four categories in C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| and that numbers reflective of industry standard areas are put in those slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| and then we'll see them and MPC can take some factual look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| whether it's other ordinances or call the sign company and say, what you making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8714)|
| 2:25:19| But, I mean, it ought to be practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| and it ought to err on the side of being a little bit bigger than maybe you want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| but it's a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| We don't want to tie anyone's hands so much that they can't advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| That would be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| You're going to have to come up with a number when you pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| You're going to have to have what it is when you pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| You can't say we're going to leave this to somebody else to decide what number to go in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8737)|
| 2:25:43| You're going to have to decide what that number is and how you go about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| We have four numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| We just don't know how good they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| We have four numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| We don't know how good they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8749)|
| 2:25:50| I mean, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| You won't know until you start testing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| I mean, you can come back and tweak it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| You can come back if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| If you want to get this done, if you want to do it and get it finished, that's what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8757)|
| 2:26:04| Okay, so the motion is the 180, 150, 175 on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| Is there anybody else to speak to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| Well, I'm quite concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| I appreciate Mr. Green's assistance with numbers, and I also agree with Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| We're really in the weeds on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| and I don't think that we have the expertise or knowledge to be able to make a sound assessment of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8785)|
| 2:26:39| So I think that we need to do this at another time when we've got some other input from people who know more about this than the nine of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8799)|
| 2:26:52| Any other comments on this, on the motion that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| So if this 180, 150, 175, and so forth is on the floor and we don't adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8818)|
| 2:27:05| then does it revert to what is stated, the 195, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| But then we can still massage it from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| Later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8835)|
| 2:27:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| Councilman Della Vopi, are you speaking to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8840)|
| 2:27:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| So right now the motion on the floor is dealing with the maximum sign area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| and it's 180, 150, 175 based on the four categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| Well, I'm going to vote no only because I think we are shooting blind into a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8870)|
| 2:27:56| I don't know what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| The motion fails six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| So we're back to what's listed there now at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| I'd like to move that we refer first to the legal department and later to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| to design a four-numbered table corresponding with what's in C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| so that we have appropriate signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| But I think someone, and if it isn't us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| then it ought to be either the legal department or the MPC or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| make some inquiry to the sign industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| There are people out there, and we can get some reasonable numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| and I think we should err on the side of being a little larger than the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| squeaky one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| I mean, I think we ought to have them come back with a number that's rational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| Otherwise, I don't know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| Did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| Did the motion or are you just asking the law department to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| To return with a table when they come back with the information in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| based on normal sign standards from the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| I don't think that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| And besides which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| I don't know that the law department has any real expertise to offer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| We can draft stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| Yeah, we got a phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| You got a phone too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| They ain't home right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| They ain't home right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| Well, press on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| So, again, do we want suggestions from the council to law departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8974)|
| 2:29:42| or from the sign industry to the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| What would help the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| We'd be glad to accept suggestions from whoever wants to submit them to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| but we're not going to have any expertise to evaluate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8992)|
| 2:29:58| I'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8998)|
| 2:29:59| This is a law department issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| I'll continue to help Krista if there's certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| I mean, we've worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| I hope you all understand with what we're going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| what the sign task force went through for three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| But, anyway, no, I'll be happy to assist in any way that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| So that 116D is staying the way it is for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| but you're going to work with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| and see if you can't come up with something that can pass the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9020)|
| 2:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Anything else under section 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| Section 12, sign construction and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Let me turn the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| Yeah, I guess 13 is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| Section 13, abandoned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| So 13 and 14, I think some of this go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| 120 days on the first three has discontinued for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| There's something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| These microphones, you really have to speak into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| So we've got 120 days on 13.1 on the first few lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| discontinued for a period of use of 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| Then you drop down to 14.2, and then it's down to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9077)|
| 2:31:24| Okay, 60 days here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| Now you go to 14.2, and after 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| a notification is signed to be it has not been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| It just seems like those days, they need to coincide together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| They need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| George, I talked to Christa about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| and since we're talking about 13 and 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| what we're talking about is eliminating 14.1 and 14.2 because of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9108)|
| 2:31:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| I'm in favor of eliminating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| I'll make a motion we eliminate 14.1 and 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| Is that the registration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| And I'm correct on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| Christa, we talked about eliminating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| We did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9127)|
| 2:32:08| 14.1 and 14.2, registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| Well, I'll make a motion we eliminate 14.1 and 14.2 in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| And where does that take us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| To change in use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| No, that's registration of nonconforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| Right, and that leaves us with change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| Is that what you're saying, 14.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| Well, 14.3, we haven't gotten to 14.3, the effect of change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| So Christa has come up with some additional language of explaining change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9152)|
| 2:32:42| So she has it and she can read it if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| But she's presented that in an e-mail late this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| and we tweaked it a little bit more even after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| Change of use, you've got to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| So she has done that, and I believe it's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9182)|
| 2:33:08| It's still a little wordy, but it's okay with me that it defines what change of use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| And what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| Change of use would be, back to Swanson's words, substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9194)|
| 2:33:20| If you change that same type, you go barbershop to barbershop, that's not a change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| Change it from a bank to a restaurant, then that's a change of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| and you would have to bring it into conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| Have Christa read what she's come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| It seems to me we ought to take care of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| Yeah, we want to take care of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| 14.1 and 14.2, we take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| So the motion and second is to eliminate 14.1, registration of non-conforming signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| and 14.2, illegal non-conforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| And is that going to be a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| It will be a substantial change, but you're on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| Does it have to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| Yeah, I guess I had a question for the co-chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| This has been in this document since we received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| Why was it originally put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| and why are you all both now asking to remove it after you've been dealing with it for such a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9256)|
| 2:34:23| I'll let Mr. Gregg say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| Where did it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| We've gone back, Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| Please speak into the microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9268)|
| 2:34:29| These are hard, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| These are not picking up well tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| Is the volume up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| Speak in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| In reviewing it, and as I mentioned earlier, this is not a perfect document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| and it's going to be an ongoing document to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| but one of the things that we got involved in afterwards, Marshall, was the fact of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| And in reviewing this, the idea was that this would be pretty tough to enforce in terms of 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| and having people register all their signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| and how do we go about making sure that people do register their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| And so it was decided that this was something that would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| Well, I understand why you're eliminating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| but I'm asking why did you put it in the first place and why did it last so long until tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| Do you know why it was put in in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| Because it was thought that it could be enforced, and I will turn that over to Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| Let's talk to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| Let's let the law department answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| As you all know, I haven't been here since the beginning of the design task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| but my understanding is that some of the provisions were just copied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| Charles said she wasn't born then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9334)|
| 2:35:39| Some of the provisions that are in the proposed sign ordinances before you were copied from our current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9339)|
| 2:35:47| So in our current ordinance, we have a Section K that talks about nonconforming outdoor advertising signs and structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| and it says an owner of any advertising or business sign, dot, dot, dot, onwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| And the date in there is July 1st, 1984, which, well, we won't talk about whether I was born or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9359)|
| 2:36:10| So I think this was just copied and pasted from our current ordinance into the new one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9370)|
| 2:36:17| because at that time there was a huge overhaul of the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| and perhaps less signs that would make such a registration more manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| But it's been in there, and I don't know that there was really any –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9388)|
| 2:36:33| Dwayne could speak to this, but whether there was consideration given to it since it was just copied and pasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| Was it ever enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| As K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| This would have been 30 days after July 1st, 1984, so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| They're just getting the notices out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| Yeah, and I think I may have found the answer to my own question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| In the draft of March 6th, 2015, it was still 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9418)|
| 2:37:06| And now they have the effective date of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| So probably when you reviewed it and it was 84, you thought, well, that ship has sailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9429)|
| 2:37:16| but now it's quite a different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| Well, it also had to do with the fact that we thought –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| Such a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| We thought that we were going to be able to do that and be able to have those signs registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9443)|
| 2:37:28| But in going into it further, we found out that it was going to be a lot more difficult than what we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| It's like trying to get permits for temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| That's why we're going to be dealing with temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| So the motion is to eliminate it, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| So we have a motion and a second to eliminate 14.1 and 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| Can we vote on this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| Okay, I'm going to take a stab at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| Hallelujah, look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| Okay, unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| Now what's the change in use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| She's got a draft, a change of use, and I'll let her read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| Well, I have hard copies available for the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9488)|
| 2:38:11| but for the benefit of the audience and those watching, I would like to bring it up on my computer, but I would –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9491)|
| 2:38:17| Jesse, can you cut my computer off for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| I'm going to pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| Do you have the hard copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| I do, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| The change in use for 14.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| This is 14.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| Okay, this would be their substitute for 14.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9509)|
| 2:38:35| Can you please read it so we can hear it at least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| It's going to give you a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9518)|
| 2:38:39| I'll read it in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| You're getting a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9520)|
| 2:38:41| I'm going to pull it up on the screen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| Which section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9524)|
| 2:38:45| 14.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| You're on page 326.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| If I were taking a vote, I'd let you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| I wish I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| The first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9548)|
| 2:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9549)|
| 2:39:10| We're in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| You can't get out that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| Character and nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9553)|
| 2:39:28| Okay, I'm ready, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| Do you want me to read it out loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| With feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| A change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| For the purposes of this article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| a change in use occurs when the principal use occupying the property changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| from a use permitted or permitted on review as designated or enumerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| for the zoning district to another use permitted or permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| designated or enumerated for the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| If there is an expansion, an increase in the gross square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| or number of dwelling units of an existing use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| or in its operating characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| such as an expansion of operations previously conducted within a fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| enclosed building to operations conducted outside an enclosed building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| such that the resulting use is a designated or enumerated use separate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| the designated or enumerated previous use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| then this constitutes a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| If a use is not designated or enumerated in the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| the building official or designee shall have the discretion to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| whether there is a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| A change in the ownership or management of a use or establishment without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| the type of changes noted above is not considered a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| A use prohibited by the zoning district or an otherwise illegal use shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| not be allowed to continue use of a nonconforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9645)|
| 2:40:49| For clarification, just because I know zoning is sort of foreign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9649)|
| 2:40:56| when I'm talking about designated or enumerated uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| I'm talking about the lists that accompany each type of zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| In a C2, you have retail, eating and drinking establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9667)|
| 2:41:14| That's the list that's set forth in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| When it changes from one of those to another one of those that's in the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| that's a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| If it's not listed in there but there's a question as to whether it's a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| in use, the building official would have the discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| per this definition, to decide whether it's a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| If I make a motion, we substitute this language for the language that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| the exhibit before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| May I clarify something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| We may just need to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| I'm not sure if we should substitute it entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| but it may be just worth adding it as a definition to the current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9717)|
| 2:41:58| I change it to add this language to the current 14.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| Which 14.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| Well, it would be 14.1 now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| 14.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| 14.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| It would become 14.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9733)|
| 2:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| So the language that Krista just explained would now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| what is shown is 14.3 now, but all the numbering will change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| because we've eliminated two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| So do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| Discussion about the new language that's being added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| That's what's appropriate now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| Councilman Grady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| I'm concerned about the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9768)|
| 2:42:49| Councilman Grady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| So in layman's terms, basically, if I have a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| and I have a deli, Dwayne's Deli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| and Vice Mayor Pavlis comes in with a deli, we don't have to change the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9783)|
| 2:43:09| We can keep the sign that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| If Dwayne's Deli goes out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| and Nick Pavlis's, I mean, no, Nick Delivoki's Pawn Shop comes in, you know, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9795)|
| 2:43:22| then that's a change of use and he would have to get new signs, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| What if it's a restaurant instead of a deli?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| Is it still a food service industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| I mean, you've got confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| Well, that's why I'm asking in simple terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| Change of use within the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| So a pawn shop, I'm not sure without looking in a specific district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9817)|
| 2:43:43| without some context how it would be classified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| but it's either a pawn shop or some sort of retail establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9825)|
| 2:43:49| which is a different use enumerated than an eating and drinking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9829)|
| 2:43:56| So it is a different use, then we change the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9840)|
| 2:44:01| Just wanted that to be sure everybody understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| Now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| Now, Councilman Delivoki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9848)|
| 2:44:09| Thank you, and I'm sorry I didn't hear what you said, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| I'm concerned about the last part where if you can't figure out what the hell we said in the first ten lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| the guy's got discretion to make up a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| That strikes me as arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| I mean, I'd love to have an official with discretion to decide whether it's a change in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| but there's no objective standard to measure that by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| and it looks like you're asking for a lawsuit you're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| I don't get that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| I mean, if the first part is clear that there are enumerated uses in each zoning category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9876)|
| 2:44:42| and if you depart from those, it's a change in use, I guess I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| The language is a little bit obtuse to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| but when you go down to if you can't find it in the list, you can make it up on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9889)|
| 2:44:54| I think that's arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| I don't see how a judge can approve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| or a poor applicant can know that that's a fair decision or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| There's no standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| Well, if I may, there are lots of instances where the building official has discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| and that decision is appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| and then that decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals is appealable to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| and then it goes to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| So there's lots of opportunities for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| and the building official doesn't typically make discretionary decisions without having a basis for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9922)|
| 2:45:28| So in presenting his case, if you will, to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| he's going to have to back up the decision that he's making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| So while there are no standards, he can have that discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| and he has that discretion in other areas of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| So I don't think it's inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| Dan Kelly would also like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| Not every land use or every business is listed in the zoning ordinance under permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9952)|
| 2:45:59| There are hundreds of businesses out there that you will find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| that aren't listed specifically in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| The building official right now is making the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| that those uses are similar to and would be permitted in the current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9970)|
| 2:46:16| If someone is aggrieved by a decision of the building official in this particular regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9976)|
| 2:46:23| I would assume that the appeal then would be to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| and back to you eventually if somebody feels like he is overstepping his bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9987)|
| 2:46:34| Do you have any current standards that he looks at to decide if he's within the right ballpark or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=9994)|
| 2:46:41| Or is the standard up top, essential change in the character and nature of the activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10001)|
| 2:46:46| and you've got to decide is it still a kind of retail, is it still a kind of food service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| is it still a kind of gas service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| You're not going to find computer store, you're not going to find tanning salons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| all these types of businesses that have come along anywhere listed in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| I'm not even sure that a pawn shop is listed in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| But there have been decisions made over the years that these are general commercial type uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| that would be compatible with other general commercial uses typically permitted in C3 or C4 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10030)|
| 2:47:17| I wonder if we could recognize Mr. King for the brief purpose of telling us what he's standing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10037)|
| 2:47:22| wanting to tell us on change in use very pointedly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10042)|
| 2:47:29| It is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| But keep in mind that in many instances the owner of a sign is not the same as the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10051)|
| 2:47:44| A lot of this treats it as if that was one and the same person owning both the sign and the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10064)|
| 2:47:52| That's true for on premise only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| It can be on premise or off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| But to illustrate my point, let's do a little exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| Just take a piece of paper and draw a square on it, about so big a square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| And then in the right lower corner make a little square down there and we're going to say that's 50 by 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10086)|
| 2:48:15| That's the sign spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| The small box, 50 by 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| The big box is vacant and it's 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| The 50 by 50 box has a permanent easement on it for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10105)|
| 2:48:35| There is a lease agreement between the owner of that sign and the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10115)|
| 2:48:43| Now then, the owner of the property decides he doesn't want that property to be vacant anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10123)|
| 2:48:49| and he builds something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| That's a change and that sign is no longer conforming and it has to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10132)|
| 2:49:00| The types of things that happen using this kind of language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| I think I illustrated or pointed out some of those types of questions in the memo that I sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10146)|
| 2:49:16| The problems incident to these kinds of things are extremely significant as to how they flow through to reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10156)|
| 2:49:26| what's happening, so to speak, on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| We've talked about, well, the law department is going to work on that and they'll bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| I'm concerned at some point in time this body is going to vote tonight on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10176)|
| 2:49:42| and we still really don't know what it's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10182)|
| 2:49:46| What's focused on the activity on the property, not the ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| Well, that's not what this definition says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| What it says up top, it says an essential character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| or nature of the activity conducted on the lot changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| That's why I say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10199)|
| 2:50:00| You're talking about activity on a lot on which a sign is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| What you're doing is you're doing something to the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| because it's located on a piece of property that all of a sudden gets used in a fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10209)|
| 2:50:14| that it wasn't being used for when the sign went on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| And I don't really know what the city's posture is going to be to go tell that sign owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10219)|
| 2:50:25| you've got to take that sign down when he's got a lease that's running for another ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| and he's got a recorded easement down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| I mean, you know, there may be some serious issues about that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| But, again, it's just the nonrecognition of the different kind of subject matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10241)|
| 2:50:47| that you're dealing with on on-premise, off-premise, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10247)|
| 2:50:55| As I say, I expressed my concern in those questions that I presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10255)|
| 2:51:01| I hope all of you got my memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| If you didn't, tell me and I'll be happy to get you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| But this is another example of a real significant problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10266)|
| 2:51:14| Wouldn't that be considered an off-premise sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| Wouldn't that be considered an off-premise sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| It's an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| Right now it would be a preexisting nonconforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| and it would be protected under 13.7208 of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| And this ordinance seems to present a different view of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| But, you know, you all don't permit any new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10298)|
| 2:51:47| And I'm not speaking for the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| They take that up for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| But that is an illustration of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| Well, I think that's an off-premise sign, and that's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| He'd be leasing a sign on somebody else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| You know, for that use, that becomes an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| We're talking about on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| Even if he owned the big square and he subdivided it and sold it off, he sold it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| He sold that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| It's an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10337)|
| 2:52:18| I did not understand that the change in use applied only to on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| Should we say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| We're talking about on-premise property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| We're not talking about off-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| I don't think that it specifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| Well, that's what we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| Then I think we need to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| We need to clarify that, that we're talking about on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| The ordinance says signs, and if you read through the definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| you all have combined the subject of off-premise signs and on-premise signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| and treat them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| That's the definitional problem that the gentleman who was here earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| Mr. Douglas, was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| Thank you for answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10378)|
| 2:52:59| I think there should be only the change in use on on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10383)|
| 2:53:04| Because off-premise signs are still advertising off-premise activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| How can you say there's a change in use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| The sign task force looked at on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| That's what we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| We did not discuss off-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| And if we need to make those corrections, then you need to make those corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| But this deals with on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10399)|
| 2:53:23| Okay, so we currently have a motion on the table to add the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| So, Dwayne, Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| Just, you know, for further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| why don't we just say that any time a business changes or closes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| whatever new business comes in has to put up a new sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| or conform to the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| No, that's way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| That's way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10425)|
| 2:53:46| She's trying to give you some latitude where you don't have to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10429)|
| 2:53:50| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10430)|
| 2:53:51| In a reasonable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10431)|
| 2:53:52| I'm just trying this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| Oh, I mean, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| 13-7208 is what you did by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| I think you've got to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| Back to what we talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10440)|
| 2:54:01| this thing's about being reasonable to the business owners that they're selling their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| Your deli, you sell it to Nick, comes his deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| You know, you didn't change the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| You still had the same use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| Even you change the ownership doesn't mean you leave it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| You shouldn't have to change the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| Throwing it out for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10460)|
| 2:54:21| it's a way to clean up the signs that we have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10461)|
| 2:54:25| It's awfully harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| It's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| I don't think it's not anything we talk about in the sign task force and not say, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10467)|
| 2:54:33| This was added later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| This was added by Stair at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| Yeah, Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| What do you intend to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| I think it's very harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| It's very harsh to leave it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10488)|
| 2:54:49| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10489)|
| 2:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10490)|
| 2:54:51| So we have a motion and a second to add the language that Krista provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10491)|
| 2:54:56| I'm going to ask that we amend that to say change in use for on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10496)|
| 2:55:02| So limited to that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| I agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| Entire category, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| Entire 14.1 deals with change in use for on-premise signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| and it doesn't deal with off-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| That's a different beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| And I have an additional suggestion to add the word on-premise between non-conforming and sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10515)|
| 2:55:23| as it's highlighted on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10525)|
| 2:55:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| Because that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| I can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| I think this whole ordinance deals with on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| We may have to, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| You know what you've got voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| Cindy, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10543)|
| 2:55:44| Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10546)|
| 2:55:47| Is council ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| And that was a friendly – that's just added on to that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| So we only need to vote once on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10556)|
| 2:55:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| Does that mean we're done with 13 and 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Anything else on 13 or 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| Well, Krista, can you explain why what is now the old 14.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| regulations for off-premise signs approved prior to 1984?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| Which is 14.2 now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10579)|
| 2:56:20| Which is 14-whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| Why do we need to – why that needs to be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| So that's related to billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10587)|
| 2:56:28| and I think that that's just copied from the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10588)|
| 2:56:35| That's not what we're dealing with is off-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| I move we strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| There's no other references to billboards in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| and we're not talking about billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| It's in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10604)|
| 2:56:45| We may need to keep that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| Signed billboard or other advertising device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| We put it in the definitions, but, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10609)|
| 2:56:54| That's a sign type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| What's the problem with leaving it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| Because we were originally just dealing with on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| We haven't – you know, the sign task force didn't discuss billboards at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10624)|
| 2:57:12| I thought that was in prohibited uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| Yeah, there's a prohibited – Section 3.8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| billboards and other off-premise signs are prohibited in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| You've been regulating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10644)|
| 2:57:29| Page 300, it's Section 3, Subset 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| It's prohibited in all zone districts other than, I guess, as grandfathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| So this ordinance does address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10659)|
| 2:57:44| Speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| This ordinance does address those and has since the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| Unintentionally, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10672)|
| 2:57:59| Okay, is there any action to be taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10682)|
| 2:58:07| Okay, can we move on then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10687)|
| 2:58:08| Section 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| Might I just ask, Krista, this is to preserve the sign law that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| without throwing it out with the bathwater, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| This is a control of off-premise signs that's preexisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| Or it lives somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| I would not recommend – I would recommend leaving it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| Okay, leave it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10712)|
| 2:58:36| Okay, so that is being left in at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10716)|
| 2:58:40| Councilman Grieve, did you have your light on for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| Yes, are we on 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10722)|
| 2:58:43| We are now on Section 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| Okay, 15.4, I'd like to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| Really speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| Here's a sign right in front of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10730)|
| 2:58:51| Please speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| 15.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| Permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| Signed permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| I'd like to just have Peter address the fact, have we raised the rates for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| and where do we stand on our fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| whether or not this is really enough compared to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| 75 plus 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| 15.4, page 327.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10752)|
| 2:59:20| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Peter Arons, Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| We re-evaluated our fee schedule, compared it to regional neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10763)|
| 2:59:29| found that we were quite a bit lower than our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| realized that the current fees don't come close to covering the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| associated with regulating the signed portion of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| We raised them accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| They're not out of line with our regional neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| They're actually still lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| but we thought it would be appropriate to raise them to these levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| So these are the numbers that you're recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| Thanks, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| Okay, so no changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| What about the hospital thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| Okay, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| Just dealing with the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| Is that the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| That's hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10805)|
| 3:00:07| Well, that was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10808)|
| 3:00:14| Can we remove the pins from our fingernails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| We're back to the original motion as amended, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10817)|
| 3:00:23| which will incorporate all these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Approve it as changed just this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10826)|
| 3:00:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10833)|
| 3:00:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10834)|
| 3:00:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| Mayor, can we have Cindy review those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| Actually, I thought Will might want to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| I'd like for him to read every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| Have them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| All I want you to know is Cindy wishes she had retired two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10846)|
| 3:00:50| rather than two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| I just heard his report, blah, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10854)|
| 3:00:55| Mayor, I do want to say one thing about Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| She was at every signed task force meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| and she was really the glue that held us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| And I can't say enough for the amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| and effort that she put forth after hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| and the amount of time that she has spent with me going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| and digging through the archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| And I just want to say, Cindy, thank you, thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| In fact, let's give her applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10877)|
| 3:01:23| Of course, this is what drove her to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| So thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| So you're blaming me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| I'm blaming you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10890)|
| 3:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10891)|
| 3:01:32| So now we're going to vote on this motion to approve 12A as amended, multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10900)|
| 3:01:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10903)|
| 3:01:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10904)|
| 3:01:45| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| So we've got eight for and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| Alternate motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| So there is a no when signed off the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10913)|
| 3:01:58| No living person remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| And so now we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150707?start=10920)|
