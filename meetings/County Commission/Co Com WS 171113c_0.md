| 0:10:06| Okay, I didn't know if you were going to give me permission to speak or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Boesler, members of the Commission, the board discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| quite a bit last week at the workshop and at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Ultimately, what they approved, this was going to come from coupon book money, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| a lot of discussion about that, and what the board ultimately approved was $500 to reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| the meeting room for the banquet, Teacher of the Year Banquet, with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| that we were supposed to work towards getting a donor to fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| I think as of this afternoon, we have found a sponsor that is going to fund the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| this, so that's kind of the latest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| But the $15,000 the board did not approve, they approved $500 to reserve the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| center for the banquet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Okay, I was just trying to find out, there was an article that said it was coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| coupon book sales, was that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| That was the initial discussion and the recommendation at first, but the board discussed this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| did not wish for this money to come from coupon book sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| I was going to say, so our resolution says it's just a contract amending the use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| space for 15250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| You're still going to have to do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Still got to have the contract, but you've got a donor now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Yes, to reserve the contract was $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| It was due, I think, this month, so that was going to reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| If we hadn't gotten a donor to sponsor it, then we would not have paid for it out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| coupon books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| But this item had to be sent over prior to the board meeting, so that's the reason that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| it's in the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| I want to make a motion to send without recommendation and change my motion, because what I want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| to do next week is to send us the donation so we can put the whole thing together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| put it to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Okay, so the motion before us is to pass without recommendation to a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=731)|
| 0:12:22| Yeah, he's going to bring the, can you get with Jill and add the sponsorship so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| go ahead and put the whole thing to rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=746)|

| 0:13:16| From reading this agreement, it looks like this is an agreement just for us to take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=796)|
| 0:13:29| maintenance of anything, any improvements that the state makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=809)|

| 0:18:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1107)|

| 0:18:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Item 47, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 6, Section 6-48, entitled Leash Requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and Chapter 27, Section 27-7, entitled Animals in County Parks, to define wild or exotic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| animals to only include all animals classified as Class 1 under Tennessee Code annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Subsection 70-4-403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| This amends Ordinance No. 0-98-10-101, adopted October 26, 1998, and Ordinance 0-10-4-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1164)|
| 0:19:35| adopted May 24, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| And we have a speaker here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Yes, ma'am, could you please give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Yes, my name is Victoria Clowda, 6644 Raccoon Valley Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| So this ordinance amendment came about because I had originally contacted the Parks and Rec Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1203)|
| 0:20:13| and I was told that my animal was not allowed in a county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| My animal weighs 2.3 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| His name is Felix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| He's about this big, and he's a fennec fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| They are not native to this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| They're not native to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| They are native to Africa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| And I was told that he was not allowed in the parks because he was an exotic animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| Upon poking that question a little bit, I found that the way the code is written right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| no exotic animal period can be allowed in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| So an exotic animal could be anything like a hedgehog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| It could be a chinchilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| It could be a crested gecko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| It could be a pet that a small child has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| So these types of animals, I believe, should be allowed in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| And by changing this code to the way that it is stated, this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| it will allow us to not only include those animals in parks in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| but it will also exclude animals that we wouldn't want in the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| because it's a little ambiguous currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| Vice Chair Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I've been looking at the pet ordinance for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| and we were talking about exotic animals and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| The phoenix fox that this lady is talking about is an exotic animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| It's also an animal that we don't have a way of testing for rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1308)|
| 0:22:00| So we don't know if it has rabies or non-rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| And I also talked to some veterinarians about the fox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| and it being an exotic animal or a wild animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| He's not a wild animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Bear with me because I talked to a veterinarian that they said it was a wild animal classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| You have domestic animals and wild animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Now, a domestic animal can sense the difference between the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| and some veterinarians say domestic animals will attack another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| what they sense is a wild animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Now, I don't have a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I was looking at this whole issue about not because of your fox, the phoenix fox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| but just animals in general, the way the pet ordinance was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| And I got a lot more education than I thought I needed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| But anyway, that's one of the reasons they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| If that dog, your fox, bites another person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| there's not a test that they have to check for rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| However, within your Section 6, your animal codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| you can look under what happens if an animal bites someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| and the animal is put under a quarantined period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| It is not immediately euthanized and tested for rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| That's the way the county codes are written currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| Ma'am, I hate to interrupt you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| but we are into discussion at this point amongst the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| So the situation that we're talking about here is these exotic animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| is not really clearly defined in how they're regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| but the Veterinarian Association that I had been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| not before your issue came up in the park, but others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| of how we treat these animals under the pet ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| And with these exotic animals comes risk to other people and other animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| and how they react to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| And the veterinarians were really saying domestic dogs to domestic dogs will fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| but a domestic dog to another one that thinks it's another little dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| will try to kill the other animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| And I said, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| And they were explaining that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And I don't know how we'll answer that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| but letting your dog run, your fox, Phoenix fox, run freely as a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| And I like its big ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I know what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| It's a cute animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| But it also incites a danger to itself with other domestic animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| is all I'm saying, this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| And that's what veterinarians have told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| through the Tennessee Veterinarian Association and a couple of local veterinarians here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| So I was just bringing that up to the rest of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| that were to try to change this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| We have a dog park, but that's not a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| It's a fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| And there's a difference there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| So we might need to kind of take a little bit of education from some veterinarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| to let us decide if we really need to do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Just confirming, this will be a public hearing on this since it's a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| I just was wanting to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| People who have the beautiful birds, I call them the Caribbean birds and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| and they have their wings clipped and they bring them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| You see them a lot, you know, on Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| see them down by Calhoun's and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Are those considered exotic also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| And I do have a concern if we can't have a way with the rabies and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| That's a very serious health issue for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| and also we need to make sure we have definite clarification before we change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Yeah, I know you said we were in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Can we ask the speaker a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Victoria, you and I had a discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| and, I mean, you know my concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| But Class I, the definition of Class I, what all does that include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| A Class I animal is all your really large, inherently dangerous animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| as defined by the TWRA, the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| So that would include lions, tigers, things like that, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| that you absolutely do not want in your parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| They're animals that have to be maintained by a zoo in a permanent type housing setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| So what is your animal classified as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| A Class III exotic, or a Class III animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| They don't use the word exotic in the state ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| However, he's a Class III, which is in the same class as a hedgehog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| which is in the same class as a chinchilla, as a non-native rabbit, a non-native hamster, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1660)|
| 0:27:49| It's your not inherently dangerous non-native species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| Also listed in that class is bobcat and primates not otherwise listed in Class I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Commissioner Busler, in your conversations with the state veterinary board, or whoever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| have any of the other 94 counties adjusted their policies on exotic animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| I didn't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| I was asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| I was asking, when we first passed this PED ordinance about two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| under Commissioner Orenby, when he presented, I really didn't look at it real closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| but it also gave a lot of definitions how you take care of animals and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Then we got into the exotic animals, but I have not got to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| No, I have not asked anybody else how they reacted to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| only that they told me about some of these animals and how you have to care for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| and how domestic animals react to wild animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| And then a follow-up, I mean a follow-up, another question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| Does this, because an exotic animal would be allowed in one of our county parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| how does that play out as far as the liability against the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Anytime, and this is the owner's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| I think the county would be immune, but the owner's responsibility in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| it's referred to as strict liability, and there is no defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| So if an animal of an owner injures another animal or another person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| from a legal standpoint, they're totally exposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| and strict liability is what it says it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| They would have to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Even if we changed from domestic animals to exotic animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| We can look at it in a little bit more depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| I prefer to err on the side of caution when it comes to strict liability issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| and it does attach to all wild and exotic animals, strict liability does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| I'd have to do a little more research in terms of the negligence aspect of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| and then you have comparative fault and a lot of other issues that would attach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| but we can give you a little bit more information as it relates to the type of animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| and what the law is related to these animals by the next reading at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| We'll have you something that will give you a clear definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| of what the young lady here is talking about in terms of species and animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| and try to get some more information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I was just going to make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| As you're getting rulings and doing research on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| we've got a great resource in our backyard with the Institute of Agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| at the University of Tennessee and the University of Tennessee Vet School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| That might be, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| an expert witness that could help confirm what she's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| or give us any additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| So if the commission's with your direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| I can reach out to the Institute of Agriculture at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Then we'll be fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Don't I still have three minutes and 30 seconds left to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Awesome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| I would like to touch on the topic of rabies really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I've done a lot of research into rabies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| and that seems to be your main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I would say that in all my research that I've done on the CDC's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| who track rabies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| I've never found a case of reported confirmed fennec fox rabies worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| There hasn't been one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| There is a vaccine that these animals are given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| It's a vaccine that you give a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| It's a vaccine that you give a ferret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| There are not studies that say it specifically protects them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| However, under your county ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| the only thing that is needed for an animal to be vaccinated is that it has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| given by a licensed veterinarian on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| It's a three-pronged test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| My animal is given an approved vaccine on an annual basis by a licensed veterinarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| Under your ordinances, my animal is vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| That is the gist of the rabies argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| because there is no argument when you look at the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| So whether or not it protects them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I don't think that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| I think the question is it's a question of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| That's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| We're looking at the ordinances here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| And the way it's written, my animal is vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Another thing to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| you all are very concerned about another animal attacking mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| You know, if I'm attacked by an animal, it's that owner's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Would not the same be if that animal attacked mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| If a dog attacks another dog, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| You know, if a poor girl, I have this friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| and her little girl, Susie, has a hedgehog named Pistachio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Pistachio goes to county parks all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| He often frequents her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| He gets in a little carrier, goes around to county parks with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Susie's mom and her dog, and he stays within his carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| You know, is that something that you all don't want to allow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Do you not want to allow hedgehogs in parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Do you not want to allow, you know, chinchillas, hamsters, things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| I think everyone gets caught up on this rabies issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| And foxes account for .4% of all rabies within the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| And those are foxes that are normally bitten by a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| So your top rabies vectors are cats and dogs, not foxes, not raccoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| It's cats and dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| So if your biggest concern is rabies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| then I suggest you ban cats and dogs from your parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| because that's where you're getting the majority of your rabies cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| And to add one more point before I finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| you know, these animals, everyone has these stigmas about owning these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| They're not egregious animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| They're not out to harm people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| My fennec fox is registered as a therapy animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| He is insured through a company as a therapy animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| He is registered as my emotional support animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| So while you may not be of the opinion that this animal is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| that maybe should be kept or that it shouldn't be allowed in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| the fact is that people do own these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| And to exclude all those people from your parks, it just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| Excuse me, can I ask you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| The vaccine that you're giving your fennec fox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| is it approved for use on fennec foxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| But the veterinarians at UT do use it on fennec foxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| and I take him to UT Exotics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| He's given a vaccine that is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| In general, I get a little placard just like everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I get a piece of paper that says he's had his vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I get a little tag for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| He's vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| You bring up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| This is an exotic animal, and you go to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| and you're bringing an animal that is not normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| and this animal is attacked by someone else's pet or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| bites a child or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Aren't you responsible because you're bringing an exotic animal to a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| that no pets has ever seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| You should be liable, not the dog itself should be liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Maybe you should be the one that's liable, which brings to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| do you have insurance that would cover most homeowners' policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| cover pets biting other kids or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Do you have an insurance policy that would protect you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| However, if we're going to talk about another animal attacking mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| okay, let's say my fennec fox is an exotic animal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| The definition of an exotic animal is a non-native species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Can we all get on board with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Okay, so I have a red fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| They're native to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| If you go to a park, you can find red foxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| You can find raccoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| You can find squirrels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| They're not pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| They're native to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| It's not an exotic animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| They're not pets, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| We're talking about pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| But a dog could still run into one in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| Just if I were to bring my red fox to a park, exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| I understand they're not pets, which leads to the next question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| is do you have to have a license for this animal, this exotic animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| Because most, the TWRA, I mean, they're pretty strict about having licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| I have a license for my red fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| My fennec fox is a Class III animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| It is not a native species,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| and you do not have to have a license within the state of Tennessee to own one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I guess, getting back to Commissioner Daly's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| is if I take my dog to the park and it sees a red fox and attacks it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| I don't have to worry about the red fox suing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| I guess you would if I was in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Is it your red fox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| So I just need to ask the law director just for some further clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| on exotic animals and if we can move through that process first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Well, we will do some more research to give you specificity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| but however, the word strict liability means what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| It doesn't matter who attacks who first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| If an exotic or wild animal bites a domestic animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| even if provoked, the wild animal is strictly liable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| and the liability will attach to the owner, not the dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| and there is no defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| That's just what the law says about wild and exotic animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| It's called strict liability, and it says what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2329)|
| 0:39:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Just for clarification, there will be a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| You will get to come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Did you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| No, I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| It's only for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| This will be a two-vote, no public hearings required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| No public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| There will be a vote next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| You all can personally require one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| if you want to have a public hearing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| but it's not mandamus to you as the zoning ones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| I think at our next month hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| it would be a good idea to have somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| from UT's vet school here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| and somebody from UT's ag department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| You mean for workshop or regular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| For the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| For the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| If everybody's in agreeance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| I think if you're adding experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| we should also add someone from the TWA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Sure, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Yeah, if you need me to find someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| or Hugh also suggested he could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| I'm on Young William's board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| and we have people from the vet school on our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| So if you need me to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| I would specifically recommend Dr. Greenacre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| She's the head of the avian and exotics department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| at UT vet school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| and Felix is her patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| I was just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| to second what Commissioner Thomas says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| between the two of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| I'm sure we can find someone at UTIA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| My in-house attorney, also known as my wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| works for University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| so it's not that I'm volunteering her for work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| but I'm sure she could help us find somebody over there at the vet school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| I support the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| If she has someone that actually treats this animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| specifically to the specific exotic issues of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| we need to have them present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Ma'am, I want to make a couple of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| First, I'm a pet lover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| My family has had pets their whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| We on this commission have to be very careful about unintentional consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| for things we pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| It would be very easy to pass this to allow you to let you take your fox to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| but we have to look out for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| So I think it would do us good to go deeper into this at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2496)|
| 0:41:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| The motion we have before us is to pass on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2514)|

| 0:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Next item is number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| It's Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| It is amended to Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Article III, Section 3.20, Article IV, Section 4.92,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and 22 Zoning Districts within Article V| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| regarding standards for wireless communication facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| and rescinding the adoption of the Wireless Communication Facilities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| This amends Ordinance 0-9-130, adopted September 10th, 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| as amended on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| I make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| Item 52, discussion of items to be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| at the upcoming legislative delegation and commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2570)|
| 0:43:04| What are we going to talk to them about, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| I'm going to withdraw the DUI bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| I'm kind of beating my head against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I get from the Attorney General, the DA, I get one story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| I get another story from a couple of the state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| One says one thing, one says another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| So I'm not even going to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| I suggest we don't even bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| It's just to the point to where something that should be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| is that nobody wants to step up and, you know, take the lead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| And it may be, just like you said, the discussion we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| we've got 95 counties, four counties are very big counties that can handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| Smaller counties cannot, don't have the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| It's an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| But we are losing so much money, solid waste here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| We are losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| What's the possibility of a private act then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| And that way it wouldn't involve the other 91 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| I believe the State Attorney General ruled that the law on DUI offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| picking up trash was unconstitutional, I believe, if I'm correct, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| Was it the State Attorney General or somebody deflected that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| Okay, that's criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| I'll have to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| I don't think it was that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| I think it was more of an unfunded mandate for these smaller counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And that they did not have the manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| They would have to go out and hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| But we have lost over 80,000, is that correct, man hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| This is Drew Thurman, Knox County Solid Waste, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| I don't know so much about the hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| but I can just say that it used to be a situation where if someone called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| it's our most requested service in terms of solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| You know, we have seven county convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| But when people call into our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| they're normally calling about litter on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| And we used to be able to respond same day, the next day, with a crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| One of two crews could go out, typically had four to five people in each crew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| to either pick up a stretch of road, remove the litter, or pick up the dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Because we may have averaged 120 probationers per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| And now we're lucky to have one or two per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| So, I mean, you can do the math on how that translates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| I don't have those figures in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| But how that translates in terms of miles served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| I had a request today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Someone said, you know, there's this one road that's really littered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And my response is, you know, we're going to send,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| as soon as we have enough people, we're going to send people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| And we just wait until we have two or three probationers that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| And, you know, we've scaled back to where high-profile requests or easy to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| like if it's a tire or a couch on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| something that's safe and easy for one or two people to go and retrieve and remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| That's what we're prioritizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| As opposed to these complained about, you know, these litter roads that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| where someone says, this whole stretch of the road is littered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| That's a much more difficult request for us to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| I do know that part of this bill that was passed has to do with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| and I may be wrong here, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Knox County used to give blood work for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| You were required to have blood work to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| You didn't do breath tests there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Now they've got an option, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| It's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I was told that DUIs are not as far as drunk drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| Those are still hard to prosecute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| but when you're under OxyContin, OxyCodone, marijuana and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| you have to have blood work to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Well, when they go before, I was told when they go before the Attorney General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| they plea bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| And they're not going to plea bargain to pick up 24 hours' worth of trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| That's not going to be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| That's not what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I talked with the lieutenant governor, and hopefully my request was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| and my request to state representatives and state senators is to have an opt-in program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| that we as Knox County can opt in to make them do the 24 hours of litter pickup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| and get our roads back to looking clean and having couches picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| and having refrigerators and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| That's what, you know, it's kind of like beating your head against a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| And I feel for you. I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| You get calls every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I get calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Governor John Smear Highway picked up, which is a convenience-centered highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| and it is bags after bags after bags of trash that's blown off people's trucks and their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| and they won't go by and pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| And it's hit by a tractor-trailer and trash is everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| So I don't suggest that we bring this one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| We can if we have time, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Speaking along the same line, I prefer that we did not withdraw it from the basket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| but that we leave that in there to be ranked among other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| We're going to have two or three, right, two or three topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| This could still be in the top three with more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| I don't think it needs to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| I was looking at the list, and I think one and two can actually be put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| And the number six, I think, is a key that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| I think the guys, when they went to Memphis, touched on it with some other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| So I think one and two can be combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| and six could be the administrative fee on sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| But one and two really, I think, can and should be put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| And one and two, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| whenever you talk about discussed clarification of the private act regarding MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| in the Knox County Law Department, what are you referencing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Are we required to use MPC, or can we form our own planning department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| That's just kind of a question as to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| and maybe the law department can look into that at the private act on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| Do we also want to add to this about the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Well, I think the urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| we need to find a way to get an answer on that that's definitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| I mean, I feel, as the law director does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| that it no longer exists based on the fact that it's expired out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| and nobody's met and updated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| So I think it's expired out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| But if the MPC is not going to listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| they're going to still do what they think is in the urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| because of their other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Do we need the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| The two that I have down there is four and five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| and four is something about modular housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| and how you can inspect them and how we can protect the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| But it is all taken, it's an act passed at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| that the state takes the responsibility of the inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| but they don't have enough people to do the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| And when a modular house is resold, and like a regular house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| you do have a homeowner's inspection on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| You don't even have that on modular housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And some people, when they buy a modular house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| there's no protection for that individual how you set it on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| It's not even required a foundation, anything for it to sit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| But it's all taken care of at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| We have no way of protecting our citizens from some of these sales that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| once they put it on there and they go out and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| oh, the setback's not right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| and the people cannot afford a mover to come back out and move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| and set it like it's supposed to be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| And that was one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Some of these laws that they've passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| have taken our way of protecting our citizens out of our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| and put it on the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| and they don't have the inspectors and other things to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| to take care of what they're supposed to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Are you suggesting that if a used modular home goes up for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| that the county should come out and inspect it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| You should be able to know if it's livable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| If you go to some of these houses that you go into, they're not livable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| You wouldn't get a CO for that particular unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| But because we do not have that inspection right to say what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| if they're usable or not, or they're inhabitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| we don't have the opportunity to protect that person that buys that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| Doesn't the private market provide home inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| that can be done on modular units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| I just think we're setting ourselves up for some liability here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| If we start going out and saying this is a livable house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| or this doesn't meet this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| I just always thought that was kind of a free market thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Okay, you cannot go under a modular house and check the plumbing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| I think that's where you go through codes out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| You cannot look underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| You can't go inside and inspect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| It could have bad plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| It could be infested in all kinds of animals or bugs or what like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| But we can't go in and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| We don't even know if the plumbing is hooked up to the sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| because we can't even go under there and inspect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| We don't know if that's true on any stick-built house either that's resold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| You still get a, when you build a stick-built house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| you do get a plumbing and electrical inspection and it's hooked up to sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| When it's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| When it's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| And even when you resell it, if you get any kind of loan on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| you are required to have a home inspection on it, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| But not on a modular house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Not on a loan on a modular home, a pre-sale, an existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3232)|
| 0:54:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Dan may have a little bit of a comment on this, on mobile homes, modular homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I know while we were on BZA, man, Utah, we have no authority whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| It is governed by the state of Tennessee, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Utah County codes has no authority whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| My understanding is that the mobile home industry or modular home industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| they are strong and they are big lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| I think John and I sat there and we felt for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| They brought in a home, brand new modular home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| and set it outside the setbacks and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| There's nothing we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Either you make them move it or you give them a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| These people are elderly people, usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| and they don't have the money to come back and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| It's something that I think Commissioner Bush was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| We need to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Maybe we can get some traction, but I wouldn't look for a whole lot of traction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| I see that point on new setback issues that happen with modulars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| That does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I don't want to avoid Knox County's in the home inspection business on existing properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| because of the liability of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Maybe there is something we can do without the state in the form of an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| requiring people to have a survey before they set a modular home to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Because I agree, the companies that set these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| they're going to look for the easiest spot possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| and it may not be as far back as it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| But maybe that's something we could do locally without the state as an ordinance to require a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| The company setting it, get a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It will be an added expense, but sometimes that's better than a headache later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3342)|
| 0:55:52| All right, we're ready. I'll change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I'd like to talk about number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Mr. Caldwell is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Did Chris leave? I guess he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| But I want to brag on—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Let me skip to five. Let's go back to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Number five? Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| On number five, we have jurisdiction regarding annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| I've had this happen to me this past month on three different occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| where there has been an accident occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and they cannot find the jurisdiction of who writes the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| It's either the city or the county, and they both said it's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Finally, you have to call maybe a state trooper to come by and take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| We've got to look at some way of making it easier to define where the city's at and the county's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3399)|
| 0:56:50| We've got to know how you take care of certain jurisdictions on other items on our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| I've got one part of the road out there that the south part is the city, the north part's the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3417)|
| 0:57:07| and it's all under the jurisdiction of the state if the state wants to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| So how do you take care of your citizens if you don't know where the dividing line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| between the city and the county and where the state needs to kick in, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| We need some definite guidelines to make sure that when there's an incident that needs to be taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| that there's somebody there to take care of it who's supposed to take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| without sitting there and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| ìAin't my job, ain't my job. We've got to take care of our citizens.î| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| So let's let the state say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| ìOkay, let's find out the jurisdiction of annexation and where it needs to be taken care of.î| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Charlie, I have several of those same issues in District 2, Tassel Pike and 441 slash Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3470)|
| 0:58:00| and Murphy Road, one side's city, one side's, I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| So what I have been told by officials and all is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3486)|
| 0:58:16| I'll just use Tassel Pike as a model here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| Tassel Pike is a state road from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| It is also in the city. It's also in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| So I've been told, you know, city has access on Tassel Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| from where it starts down in the Smithwood area all the way right past Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| So if anything happens, the city is supposed to answer on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| Now, not in the subdivisions, but on that main road they have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| so they are allowed to sit there with speed traps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| But then if an accident happens on Mainville Highway in your district, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| It's, you know, county and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I've been told Highway Patrol has to come and answer that accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| and it takes forever because there's not as many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| So, I mean, you know, anything about putting up any caution lights or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| you know, city has access, but it's county and it's state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| So you've got to get all three to go together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| and then get somebody to say, I'll pay for that, and then I'll do the operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| So it is a mess, and I feel like it's very hard for us to take care of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3586)|
| 0:59:56| because they're paying, a lot of them are paying city and county taxes and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| And we do need clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| It needs to be mapped out where we can show and know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Okay, moving on to Item 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| So you want to move on, or are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| I guess my question on this is, what do we ask the state to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Are they just going to turn around and look at us and say the city and the county need to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| and define where their lines are better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| I don't know, but, I mean, we do need to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| who's going to take responsibility in this area if city has access and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| It's just very frustrating when you have these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| and there's a lot of traffic on these roads and a lot of things that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| and it's very frustrating not to be able to give any solving answer to your constituents that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3654)|
| 1:01:05| So somebody is responsible for this, this, and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| and we just need to know for sure and have it, I guess, documented in our county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| The 3rd District is also, in a lot of ways like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| between Cedar Bluff and the finger annexations in the northwest section of the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| There's a lot of places that you can drive down the road, you go from city to county, then back into city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah. I guess I've just, you know, as government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| and we're here to help the constituents and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| I just feel like there needs to be a defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| someone needs to take the responsibility and address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| instead of passing it from this one and that one and no one taking the responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair. The reason why I was bringing this up here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| she pointed out an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Okay, the road is taken care of by the city, but the subdivisions are taken by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| Now, there's some way that you've got to pull that back in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| okay, these areas are clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| These are the city limits and these are the county limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| You can't have a string run straight up through here and you don't take care of either side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Now, the state has to, because they have allowed this kind of annexation go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| but now we've got a new law passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| how can we now straighten it back out that they let go for so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| We just need to bring those issues up and kind of define these issues and define the boundary lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3760)|
| 1:02:49| That's basically what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| Number six, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| You know, the last meeting we brought up, the sales tax, Mr. Caldwell did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| and I was on the end of wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| Fortunately, we got to go down to the CTAS and Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| on at least three opportunities, got to stand up and present his proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| or the proposal that was before the state legislature last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| This time we got traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker got up before the legislative body there and got a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| and it was 99% almost unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| It should have been unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| We had one county commissioner out of Kingsport that thinks that the state ought to keep his money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| which is unbelievable why he would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| But after three or four different presentations by the commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| people were coming up asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| We didn't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| They were calling their trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| They were calling everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| I think we'll get a little bit of traction on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| and I think this will be an important subject that we do need to discuss at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3844)|
| 1:04:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Well, thank you for the kind comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| and I wanted to give you a quick update, too, on the financial aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| as far as what it costs Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| The fee for 2017 was $524,000 to get our own sales tax back from the State Department of Revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3869)|
| 1:04:41| And for the city of Knoxville, it was $1.7 million just to get their sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3881)|
| 1:04:50| And then the town of Farragut was $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| So, I mean, you can imagine what those entities could do to improve parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| you know, anything to make it easier for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| But $524,000 just to get our sales tax back is crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| So I think we got the ear of a lot of county commissioners around this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| and we're going to continue to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| In fact, when I left the meeting, I had a commissioner come up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| hey, I'm going to get the lieutenant governor, my senator, and my state representative together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| and I want you to come over here and we're going to have a sit down and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| So that was very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Well, I know the purpose of this discussion was to try to put together kind of our list of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| that we want to be able to talk with our peers who represent us in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| And I feel like we want to try to get to some white smoke on this in terms of how we're going to list them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| I realize this isn't a formal proposal or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and we can certainly change this between now and the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| but at least what I've heard from the fellow commissioners, I know that the combination of number one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| we all know we've banged our head on that at how many meetings when we go into our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| That seems like something that's on it that is something we can get in, that we can make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| We look at number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| That is something that a change can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| So those are two things that are influenceable, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Back to the one that Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Wright brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| the DUI thing is something potentially that we could have some influence on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| The one that I see as having the hardest time influencing or actually we can influence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| but we might just be talking to ourselves, would be on the modular housing inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| and the jurisdiction regarding annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| I almost wonder with the annexation issue around trying to figure out jurisdiction issues with law enforcement response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| is that something that needs to be solved here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| and then try to develop a best practice that can be shared with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| I mean, I don't know what we would ask them for on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| other than saying if it's clearly a highway patrol issue, they're going to tell the highway patrol to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| If it's something that's close to a city, then all cities are mandated to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| It's how do you get a defined black and white rule that they could pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| and I just don't know what that black and white rule would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| So at least that's where I'm a little struggling on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| Well, the state had an act before it to where the citizens could decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| if they wanted where they were annexed involuntarily the last time to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| could go back to just the county side, and I think that didn't pass the state line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| I guess I just want to figure out how does that translate into local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| trying to figure out when you've got issues, or issues isn't the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| jurisdictional decisions on responses, and how is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| If the state can define it, then that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Can it say it always defaults to the city if it's something that's on a line or an area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| That's something we could ask them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Can you have it be a rule that if it used to be part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| if it's been recently annexed, or if it's something that's on a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| where a city and county share a common border, those are ones that get –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| I still come down to how do you ask for help on that, and what is the ask exactly going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| What you would do is you'd go to the state and you'd say, okay, here's the issues we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| Tassel Pike, they want the road to get speed money off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| but they don't want to take care of the citizens either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Why do they need that street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| The second thing is, okay, I've got a piece of property out in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| that part of it was annexed by the city when there was nobody on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| because you could annex it so you didn't have to put out public form or notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| because there wasn't anybody living on it, but they didn't annex the houses around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| Now that piece of property is all cut up, and the people that want to buy the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| they want all the property to be county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| A bigger major part of it has houses on it that are in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| but there's also another big part that the city has annexed and nobody knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| So why can't we even those lines up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Is there some way that we can work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| Because I know that they're not going to give up their revenue on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| I guess my point is our discussion has been around law enforcement responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| and trying to figure out who's got jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| when the question that you're trying to call is really can something be undone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| from an annexation point of view, and those are really two completely different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| So that's where we almost need to figure, are we asking to have some annexation undone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| or are you saying can we develop something to make it easier for law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| to figure out who owns this, and those are two completely different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Commissioner Scowmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| At the last day of the Tennessee General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| the Tennessee Senate approved the de-annexation bill 29-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| and sent it over to the House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| so we have to encourage our House members this year to take it up and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| So it basically went to summer study for the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| So that's good that it went that strong from the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| Summer study is a place that goes to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Well, they have to bring it back because it's been approved by the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Okay, so really we have already the state legislator working on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| We just need to force the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Okay, but I thought the purpose of this meeting and our discussion items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| were very specific to Knox County, the things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| I agree that we need to push the legislator to keep working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| So looking at this list, I think one and two are definitely local items that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4256)|
| 1:11:05| Looking at number six, I wonder if, John, you haven't started that fire statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| and it's not so much that we need to push that locally to occupy one of our spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| Correct, except that we just need the Knoxville delegation to be 100% behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| because that sets the tone for the rest of the 94 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| The DUI bill, I know that, Mr. Daley, that you're tired of butting heads with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| but I think that's something that is very specific to Knox County that we definitely need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| So I would say that we throw three at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| One, two, together, three, and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| We have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Those will be our three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Are we down to announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| No, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I'm in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| We're down to discussion, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| We had the pet lease ordinance in front of us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Do we want to have a work session or a workshop specifically on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| or do we want to just address that at our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| I think it's just me because they'll have some more answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Okay, but if we're going to bring in some other speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| are you all okay with doing it during the meeting as opposed to a special meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Next, I want to get a quick update on what happened in Memphis at the TCCA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you start and then go to Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| It was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| Commissioner Carringer was duly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Several people came up and were very upset that she wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| When I explained to her it was a family situation, they understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| but you were definitely missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Even the executive director of the Tennessee County Services Association came up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| where is Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| But then he understood once I explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| But it was a good conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| I think you always go away learning something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| I don't know if maybe Commissioner Buster wants to explain what happened in the education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| regarding school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| Apparently the executive director of the Tennessee School Association wanted the commissioners to go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| with their plan to have separate school districts set up for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| It's called special school districts, which are starting to set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| which means they would get their funding directly from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| And us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Is that different than the special school districts that we already have around the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| It's a completely different thing that they're talking about to bring before the legislation because, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4446)|
| 1:14:16| we had a person there that was explaining the school districts and said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| they would go directly to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| And I had some questions for them that I have on a list there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| I said, okay, if they're going to get the funding directly from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| do we have a maintenance of effort in the county anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| If they're funding all the schools directly from the state, would the teachers become state employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| Because we're no longer funding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| It's coming directly from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Would they fall under the state insurance and not the local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| What about the insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| All this other stuff that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| And how are we going to answer that since we're not going to be funding them anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| You mean our maintenance of effort as far as the local portion would go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| I was asking all these questions because if that maintenance of effort goes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| and they're getting the funding directly from the state and also the number of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| because the state also says you have a certain number of teachers that the BEP is funded on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4513)|
| 1:15:21| And it's a lot less than what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Will we lose teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Also, what about the school, the buildings that the schools are in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| Would that still belong to the county or would the state take it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| And my question there was on the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| we're only required to have one high school and one grammar school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| So if they want to take the schools over, which high school and which grammar school are they going to take over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| You know, all this sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| And I was not really, there was not a lot of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Well, and maybe Commissioner Daly can confirm this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| but my understanding there's one county in Tennessee that has five separate school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| five separate superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Their county tax rate is $0.98 and their school tax rate is $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| What county is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Can you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| It was one of the smaller counties, too, and I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I want to say around Giles County or one of those smaller counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| I was stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Even Memphis schools are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| Shelby County schools, Shelby County has probably got, they're leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| They're leaving the Shelby County school districts and going to special school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| And who is pushing this, the TCCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| No, no, the school, the comparable group for the school boards wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4600)|
| 1:16:48| And so the commissioners said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| They voted unanimously no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| They voted not to recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| But, again, it goes directly to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| And then one of the other things they're still pursuing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| and everybody should have gotten a copy of the legislative platform in their mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| The other thing, as far as a county level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| they're still pursuing the state to pay for state prisoners at point of incarceration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| so at the point of being booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| And so they're still pushing to get paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| So there's just a lot of things going on that we'll hear about here in the next two to three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| Some of the other things, we had a good program from Mr. Tony Farmer from the TBI on the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| He would be a great, for us county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| and Metropolitan Drug Coalition and all of them, to have a meeting and have him come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| He did about a two-hour presentation in 40 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| That was mind-blowing, the things that were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| We always learn something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| I did not get a chance, but Michael or Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| I did sit in on a meeting about the U.S. Census coming up in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| Have they contacted you yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Who's their point person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| I'm not sure who the point person is with the census is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Mike Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Mike Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4699)|
| 1:18:29| Michael Grider, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| So we've had a couple meetings with some folks from the regional census office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| I think KGIS, John Gustin, is working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| They're in contact there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| They're also in contact with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I don't know who our point person is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| A lot of that's going to kick in after the new mayor takes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| So that's when that ramp-up will really start to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| It's going to be next fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| But that is something they're already starting to get on our radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| talking about forming a community committee to kind of help get the word out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| and publicize the need to return those census surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Yeah, I thought it was going to be a boring hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| but it was not because this started back in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| We're starting out three years in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| and it's very important that we get a correct number for federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| and all the types of funding that Knox County will lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| So I'm glad that we do have the point person that they have been in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| We did that on the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| The only other thing that I can think of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| we've got to be careful on the transportation part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I'm not supporting anybody yet or denying or not supporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| but we've got a couple of governor candidates that want to do away with the IMPROVE Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| That's going to do away with money that we've got for roads and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| so you've got to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| I'm not missing three cents a gallon right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| I'm not missing seven cents a gallon coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| We would lose a million dollars to pay for roads and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| So the CTAS, the commissioners, they're not for repealing the IMPROVE Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| because that's transportation money that we've been using and we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| John spoke about the jails, and I believe on the Veterans Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| it was a great year for veterans last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Veterans got everything that we asked for on Legislative Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| This year they're going to ask for a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| It may not be important to you, but it would be important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| that a Purple Heart veteran will get two license plates instead of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| because most people have got two vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| To you that may not be important, but to them that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Little issues, but we had some big wins in the veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| and there will be some more veteran issues coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Director Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| I actually should just mention that I think David Connor will be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| for your meeting on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| so it would be a good time to ask about questions about your legislative agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| and any of these other matters that are pending before the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| that are going to be of interest coming up in Nashville next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| As far as I know, David will be here Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| I just want to make one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| When we use the initials CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| we're probably meaning Tennessee County Services Association, T-C-S-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| It's easy to say CTAS, which is the public policy and the training portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4888)|
| 1:21:39| Okay, we're down to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| I would like to raise three points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| and it sort of starts with Commissioner Daly saying something a moment ago about veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| I received in my local county mailbox here in the building a card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| and I see heads nodding yes, they may have received one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| This young man may have been working from an outdated list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| because he addressed the envelope, Mr. Board Chair Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| Once a chair, always a chair, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Let me read the letter as I've received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| This is in fairly large, big pencil block print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| It says, Dear Mr. Wright, I hope you make this country a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4950)|
| 1:22:39| Then he sort of wrote a little bit in the margin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| I hope you have the best day ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| And then he had a flag, which was mostly just lines and little circles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4970)|
| 1:22:58| and a smiley face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| So that's the top half of the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Bottom half of the card says P.S., and he meant our school, but he wrote R-A-R-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4983)|
| 1:23:13| But anyway, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| That's about the way I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| Our school is going to pray for you and the rest of the council, mayor, and everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=4999)|
| 1:23:29| And he has another smiley face, and he puts under that the word you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| I think he's saying this is what he contemplates me to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| and it's big eyes and a smiley face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| And he closes by saying, To Mr. Wright, from Caleb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| I wanted to take a moment this evening to say hi to Caleb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| because it was a great day that I received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| So he sort of said something about veterans because of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| I wish to thank those people that organized the Veterans Day Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| It was Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| As the group of veterans that I was with moved from the Coliseum to Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5055)|
| 1:24:24| I thought the crowd was kind of sparse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| But as the parade route turned onto Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| there was never a more enthusiastic crowd that I've witnessed being at the Veterans Day Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5072)|
| 1:24:40| They were from kids sitting on the curb to people crammed up against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| It was wall-to-wall parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| And I wish to thank those people that came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| those veterans that came out and stood along the parade route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| because it was the best parade that I had ever had the opportunity to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| Which then brings me to my last of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| While I was there, I encountered Eddie Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| Honor Air solicits your contributions to transport veterans from Knoxville to Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5111)|
| 1:25:22| for a one-day trip to visit the memorials there placed in the honor of World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5122)|
| 1:25:30| Korean War, and Vietnam War veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| I don't know how they come up with their rules on who goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| but I would encourage any veteran to apply to participate in that trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| because it's mind-blowing at the impact that I have witnessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| upon some of the participants of that particular trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| As a result of the way I feel about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| I've written a discretionary fund disbursement to Honor Air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5167)|
| 1:26:18| and I've done mine in the amount of $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| because that's what it takes to transport one veteran on one trip, $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| I would encourage my fellow commissioners out of your discretionary funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| to submit a form to the director of the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| because once we get one form, we do not have to go through the signature process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| As this is month of November, we had Veterans Day Friday, Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5202)|
| 1:26:51| We've got Thanksgiving Day coming up, and I think one of the best things you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| and I encourage those folks out there watching us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| to consider contributing to Honor Air to allow them to then use that money 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5221)|
| 1:27:10| to transport a veteran to Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| so that they might have the opportunity to visit their particular war memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| The one last thing that I have to say is I've paid my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| I've been an escort, and one trip I had three gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5246)|
| 1:27:40| One of them could have never made the trip to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| His wife could not have taken him to Washington to the World War II memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5265)|
| 1:27:53| He was in a wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| He could, with assistance, get himself up and down the steps of the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| He sat on the front seat of the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| When he was off the bus, he had to be in a wheelchair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| and we were buddies for the day because my other two guys could take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| I encourage you, my fellow commissioners, if you could, out of your discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| contribute to Honor Air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| I just want to give a heads-up for this Wednesday, 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| It's going to be the 34th monthly Ed and Bob Night Out, and we're at East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| We're going to the Old Kays Ice Cream location on 4700 Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| which is at the foot of my childhood home where I spent many quarters getting a milkshake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| So that's going to be 5 to 7 this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| It's now called Scott's Place, and we had a wall-to-wall meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| and I hope we have a good turnout again this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| 4700 Asheville Highway, Robert Asheville Highway and Holston Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5348)|
| 1:29:15| All those come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Yeah, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| I just wanted to brag on I represent two middle schools in District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| Gresham Middle School, and Donna Parker is the principal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| Every year she hosts a veterans lunch for veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| and I've been honored to be able to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| So I wanted to say thank you to her staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| and the importance that they are showing the students there at Gresham Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| how important our veterans are and for honoring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| And since Commissioner Wright mentioned his little note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| I got a note from a little girl named Ashley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| and little did she know probably what really this meant to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker said I was not able to make the Memphis trip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| had a very serious health issue, came up with my middle brother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| and praise be to God, a miracle really happened in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| and he's not out of the woods, but it was not the C word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| And so I'm still very riding high on that great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| So this Ashley sent, and she says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| Dear Commissioner Carringer, we are praying for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Jesus loves you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Thank you for getting up every morning and going to make our country a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| I hope you have a great year, and I hope every day God will be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| And that just says it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| And why I'm here and to help serve and what we do up here every day of our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5468)|
| 1:31:16| is to make sure that we have a better place at the end of every day for the people to live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5476)|
| 1:31:26| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| This coming Saturday is the third Saturday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| That means that downtown Powell at the community center, we will have another veterans breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| and the chow line is going to be open at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| We normally have two World War II veterans there, and then we have every branch of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| Even the Coast Guard even shows up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| So we're doing that this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| They come by Powell Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| No, they come Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| But anyway, but it's downtown Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| And remember, Powell is the oldest community here, older than the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| So if you want to see a good place, come out to Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| Commissioner Dayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| I don't think I can top that, but I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| It's not the 34th, but it is the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| I asked the commissioner on the 28th of November at Gap Creek Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| So all my friends up in New Hope or Gap Creek area, Seven Islands, come and see me at the Gap Creek Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| It starts at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Tomorrow, for all of us that are principal for a day, I get to be principal at South Dole High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| who will be central Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| And also this Thursday at 2.30, we are having the Baker Creek Playforce for the South Dole Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5563)|
| 1:32:52| opening at 2.30, if anyone wants to attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| And I actually have a couple of announcements, a little veteran story too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| I had my TV broadcast premiere hosting the CTV show Friday night, and I had Mayor Burchard on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5582)|
| 1:33:11| and we had a call from a veteran who was a Vietnam veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| and he said that he had never really felt appreciated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| but he had went to one of the elementary schools for one of their veterans' presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| And I know that a lot of the schools do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Where my wife works, they do it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| So I would encourage the school system to reach out to veterans that don't have kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| that aren't the parents or the grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| to reach out to people that don't have kids in the system to try to get them to come to these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| because everyone I hear about is really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| and I think all of our veterans deserve to go someplace where they feel treated special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| Second thing is, tomorrow is principal for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| I will be at Cedar Bluff Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| And how many of you guys are doing it this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| I'll be at Inskip Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| I know where Dave's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| I was going to say, Rudy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| I will be at Rocky Hill Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I'll be at Cedar Bluff, and we need to remember that they do not allow paddling in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| You can't do that, even if you're the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| I will share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker and I will be, and Commissioner Brantley will all probably be tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| We can't do it because we're going to be doing pension committee work tomorrow from about 9 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| Is there anything else to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113c?start=5680)|
