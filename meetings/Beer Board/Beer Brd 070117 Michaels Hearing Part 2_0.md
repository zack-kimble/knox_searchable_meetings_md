| 0:00:00| The city has completed its opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| The permit holder has decided to defer the opening statement, if at all, until after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=15)|
| 0:00:22| the city completes its case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=22)|
| 0:00:25| Are there any other preliminary matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=25)|
| 0:00:27| There is, please the chairman and the board, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=27)|
| 0:00:35| We would ask, Mr. Watson, if you're going to participate as a judge in this case to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| instruct the members of the beer board as to the effect of what an opening statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=39)|
| 0:00:48| is as a matter of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| I would instruct the beer board members that an opening statement is simply a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| by counsel of what they anticipate the proof will show in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| It is not to be taken as evidence itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| When you make a decision on this case, you will make a decision based on the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| that is adduced in the case by the parties, either through the introduction of documentary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| evidence as it may be received, or through the introduction of testimony from witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| who are sworn before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| And that the statement of counsels are not evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| I think I just said that, but if I did not, your statement to that effect is, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Secondly, counsel and I have convened and met with Mr. Swanson during the recess, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=96)|
| 0:01:44| we have pre-marked a number of exhibits, but we only made one copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| The first defense exhibit was, I believe, and you may correct me if I'm wrong, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| order that governs why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| The second one is the rules of procedure that Mr. Swanson faxed to me this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=123)|
| 0:02:12| The city has filed two exhibits that's been admitted by agreement into evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=132)|
| 0:02:23| There's one exhibit that is subject to debate for further admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| I think the city has offered three exhibits, which parties will stipulate, and one exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| which needs to be discussed before the beer board considers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| We've asked for an instruction as to the legal effect of a stipulation between counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=162)|
| 0:02:51| I would instruct the beer board members that when the parties stipulate something, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| may take that as accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| You don't have to take that necessarily to be proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| You can take that as the parties agree through a stipulation that you may accept these documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| that have been stipulated as exhibits as true and lawful exhibits in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| You may consider those for whatever they may be worth in terms of your consideration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| With regard to the one exhibit, which has been marked for identification only when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| comes up during the proof, if an objection is raised to it, we will take argument with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| regard to the objection that is raised and make a ruling with regard to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| it will be received at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Anything further, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Thank you, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Swanson, exhibit three is the one that we've been referring to as for identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| That is the certified copy of the revocation suspension complaint that was filed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| against Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Since it's a certified copy of the beer board and it's before the beer board, we ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| it be admitted into evidence at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Is there an objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Would you please come to the podium, both of you, when you're going to address the presiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| officer, if you could come to the podium so we make sure we get all this on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I thought I was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| For the most part, you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Sometimes you keep talking as you wander off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| In federal court, I have a wide berth or a big chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=260)|
| 0:04:31| The document in question that's marked for identification is merely an assertion or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=271)|
| 0:04:42| accusation not supported by competent evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| It is only a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| There is no possible humanly way that any person could be called upon to defend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=293)|
| 0:05:05| document, otherwise we will be here until two weeks, if those documents are admitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=305)|
| 0:05:17| as substantive evidence, because these matters are matters that are before Mr. Petty, Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| Petty, a very respected hearing officer, lawyer in this community, and smuggling those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| into this record does nothing more than prejudice the rights of Michaels to the extent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=334)|
| 0:05:47| it deprives them of an opportunity to reasonably be heard and, in order, it denies them the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| right to prepare defense under Holmes v. South Carolina, and thirdly, it denies us a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=354)|
| 0:06:06| for effective assistance of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| No person can be called upon to defend 26 charges that the city seeks to, for lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=369)|
| 0:06:19| a better term, smuggle into this record to bootstrap their position in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=379)|
| 0:06:29| Now, if you admit it as evidence, Michaels' position is we would have no choice but to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| debate each and every one of those allegations, which is before Mr. Petty, and therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=398)|
| 0:06:49| whatever ruling you make here would render the effectiveness of Mr. Petty's role as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=409)|
| 0:06:59| hearing officer and administrative officer moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| It is unnecessary, it's not relevant, and I know you don't consider the rules of evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=423)|
| 0:07:12| but it is not relevant, and it is not provative of the issue that she made in her opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=432)|
| 0:07:21| statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| She told the Board and the Chairman what she intended to prove, and not one of those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| I submit goes to either allegation that she said she's going to prove in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| and because of that, we would ask that it not be admitted as substantive evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| Ms. Evertine, what is the purpose for which the city seeks to introduce these documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| What Mr. Bell fails to tell you is that I also mentioned in my opening statement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| the city had filed a non-compliance complaint last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| That is the purpose for introduction of this evidence, to show that a complaint was filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| and I also brought up in my opening statement that it contained in that non-compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| complaint were allegations of underage sales, over-serving, and other acts of misconduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| and that simply is to show that allegations are in the complaint, as I stated in my opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Not for the truth of the matter contained in the complaint, which will be before Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| Petty in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I'm going to rule that the documents will be admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| They will not be admitted as substantive evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| They will not be admitted to show that the allegations that are contained in those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| are true allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Those allegations are allegations which have been lodged before a hearing officer and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| now pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| There is no proof at this point in the process, there is no proof that any of those allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| are true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| They are going to be received solely for the purpose of showing the billboard that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| is currently pending before a hearing officer a number of allegations which the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| officer has not yet had a hearing on and the validity of which has not been established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| but it is pertinent to you for this purpose to know whether or not there have been other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| allegations made without knowing whether or not those allegations are true or not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| That's the ruling of the presiding officer, and now we'll proceed with evidence unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| there are other preliminary matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Ms. Ebertein, do you have a witness to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Mr. Swanson, our first witness is Officer Jennifer Mathiak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Could you spell the last name for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| M-a-t-h-i-a-k.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| And since she is the first witness, I believe we've agreed to have her at this end chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| Officer, if you would just come right up to this chair right up here on the end right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| The finance director has made that available for you and all the other witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| Would you raise your I forgot to ask, is the rule of sequestration requested in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| It just takes one party to request the rule of sequestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| It has been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Who is your representative, Mr.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Rick Jordanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Do you have other witnesses present here in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| And the city, I assume, has other witnesses in the room as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Who is your representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Donnie Huskey, the beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Everyone who anticipates testifying in this case, please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Mr. Bell, you have something preliminary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| I didn't want to invoke the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| I noticed that May I share this with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| The reason I didn't invoke the rule, I see that there are a number of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=645)|
| 0:11:01| officers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I may want to call them in rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And I wouldn't want to deprive, for example, my friend, the chief of police, the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| to sit here and witness this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| But frankly, he may have knowledge of some of the facts that would be important, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=675)|
| 0:11:24| his history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| We're going to determine that rebuttal witnesses are not subject to the rule of sequestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| So unless you intend to call someone in your case in chief, those are the witnesses I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| to have stand now and raise their right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| If there are rebuttal witnesses, we will deal with that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| But they will not be subject to the rule of sequestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| I'll raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Do you and each of you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you give before the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| You may be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| One question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| I have an expert witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| May that expert witness stay inside as is allowed under the Tennessee Rules of Evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| Is there an objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| He hasn't shown why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| I don't care which microphone you use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Just say you use a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| He hasn't shown why an expert is relevant in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Well, if it's an expert witness, though, do you have an objection to an expert witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=737)|
| 0:12:27| if that person is to be utilized not as a fact witness but as an expert witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| That will be subject, of course, to that objection as to whether or not that testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| is relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| We'll make that objection at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| So at this time, if they are truly an expert, we do not object for them to stay in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| You may proceed with your first witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| And it is now, we're starting the presentation of proof on behalf of the city, and it's now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| 9.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| So there are two and a half hours under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| We need to ask the witnesses who are going to be witnesses to please wait outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| And when you're outside, please do not talk with one another about this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| And if you get done testifying and go back outside, please do not have any conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| with any of the witnesses who are waiting outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| I think they're all out, Ms. Eberty, and you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=799)|
| 0:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Would you please state your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Jennifer Matiuk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| And where are you currently employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I'm employed right now with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| How long have you been with the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Since June of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| And what is your position with the department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| How long have you been with the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I've been with Knoxville approximately six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| And where did you work before you came to the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| I worked for the city of Cleveland, Tennessee at the police department in Cleveland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| And so what division do you currently work in here at the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| I'm a patrol officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| In your history with police departments, both here in the city as well as in Cleveland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| had you ever been involved in a beer sting before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| So on December 28, 2006, that was your first beer sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| How did you come to participate in this beer sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| On Tuesday, December 26, I was approached by Chief Pedousis and asked if I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| Any hearsay she'd say as a result of that, she did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Just explain what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Don't testify to the board what you heard, because that's hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| You're asking what I did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| That you were approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| And then what did you do once you were approached?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I agreed to meet on Thursday, December 28, in Officer Husky's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| to go into Michaels with a Explorer, an underage, under 21 female, and attempt to buy liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=913)|
| 0:15:23| And Officer Husky is the beer inspector for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| And so did you actually go on December 28 to Officer Husky's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I arrived at approximately 5.30 p.m. in his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| and met with him about details about going to Michaels later that evening and buying an alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=935)|
| 0:15:44| And who was present in the inspection unit at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| At that time, Officer Husky, Investigator Poore, and Explorer Chrissy Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| Once you arrived at the inspections unit, did a discussion ensue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| And was there an explanation about how an undercover sting works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| We were basically explained or told what our job was in the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| We were to go in, sit near the table, each order a drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| and if we were served or if Explorer Key was served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| to call Officer Husky, who was waiting outside, and at that time they would come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| And so Explorer Key, is Chrissy Key?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| After the explanation about what your role was in the sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| did you observe Officer Husky take Chrissy Key's photograph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| He each told us to clear our wallets, purses of other ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| We were just to have our regular Tennessee-issued ID or driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| He gave us each $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| He took Chrissy Key's picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| And then that was basically what we exchanged numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| and those were basically the instructions that he gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Did you see the identification that Chrissy Key was carrying with her that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| What kind of identification was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| It was her regular Tennessee driver's license, picture ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:29| Permission to approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| You may approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| We have enough copies for both it to be a place in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and then have copies of this exhibit with board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Mr. Swanson, this council, on some exhibits we have enough for all the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Do the members want these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| You've given a copy to the other side, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Yes, previously before today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| Is this the identification that you saw that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| And this is Chrissy Key's Tennessee state driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| We'd ask that this be marked as the next exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| If somebody would bring it to us, we'll have to mark it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Let's use the one that she's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Next number is city number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:36| She needed back to testify from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Other than this Tennessee driver's license ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| was Chrissy Key carrying any other identification that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| After the discussion about how the sting would proceed, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| After we left Officer Husky's office, Chrissy and I rode in an unmarked vehicle to Michael's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| parked the car in Michael's parking lot facing Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| and entered Michael's restaurant through the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| approached the bar area, and sat at a table just left of the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| No one else was sitting in the tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| There were probably, I would say, approximately 20 people around the bar area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| We sat down at a table, and a server came up to our table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| and I guess asked or requested if we wanted a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| I ordered a vodka drink, and Chrissy ordered a glass of Merlot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| She then asked to see our IDs, and I took mine out of my wallet and gave her my ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| and she looked at it, and Chrissy did the same, showed her her ID, and she looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| And at that time, the server said she would be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| A few moments later, she came back and set a glass of wine, the Merlot, in front of Chrissy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| and set my drink in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| And the driver's license ID that is now Exhibit 5, is that the ID that Chrissy showed the server that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| And you saw the ID that she was showing to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Did you leave Chrissy's side from the moment you left the inspections unit office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| to the time that she showed that ID to the server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| After the server looked at Cheryl's ID, actually, you took your ID out of your wallet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| and showed it to her, and the server looked at that ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Yes, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Did Chrissy take her ID out of her wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| She didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| She left the ID in the wallet and opened the, it was a foldable wallet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| she opened her wallet and showed it to the server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and the server, with her hand, grabbed part of the wallet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| and looked at her ID while it was in the clear part of her wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| The server didn't ask for the ID to be taken out of the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| No, she did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| And so what happened after the server took your drink orders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| A few moments passed and she came back with the drinks that we had ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| and set them in front of us, set the glass of Merlot in front of Chrissy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| and my drink in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And at that time, Chrissy went to the bathroom, to the restroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| and I called Officer Husky from my cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| A few moments passed and he entered Michael's, came over to my table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and I pointed it out to him who had served us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| And did you, in fact, get the drink that you ordered that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| And did Chrissy get a glass of what appeared to be wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| Once you pointed out the server to Officer Husky, what did you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| At that time, I went to the bathroom to get Chrissy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| and we walked out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| As we were walking out the door, Officer Husky asked for Chrissy's ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| and she gave him the ID that she had showed the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| And at that time, we kept going out the door to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| She took that ID out of the clear plastic wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I'm sorry, the pocket of that wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Where did you go once you left the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| We went out to the car and down the road out of the property of Michael's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| and waited for the other officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Once the other officers met up with you, where did you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| We went back to the police department, the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Back to the inspections unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| At that time, what happened at the inspections unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| We returned the money that was given to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and Officer Husky took another picture of Chrissy at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| And did Chrissy look the same as she did prior to going to Michael's that evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:10| That's all the questions we have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| I'm well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| You want to do good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| In that regard, if I ask you a question you don't understand, ask me to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| Can we have that agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| I take it that as most post-certified law enforcement officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| you've been through what I call witness school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| that is how to present yourself in a court of law and give testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| And part of that training as a witness is in order to enhance your credibility as a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| You would agree with that, wouldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Now, in this case, as part of your training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| law enforcement officers are told to make field notes as to a crime they witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:24| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| And specifically in the nature of what one might term a, quote, beer sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:36| there is a special document that's created by the Knoxville Police Department for such a project, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:47| I'm not aware of me doing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Are you familiar with a report that's generated by the Knoxville Police Department called an after-action report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:10| Not one that I would be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Personally, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| Do you know that they have such reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Don't look at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Look at me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I'm not aware of needing to do one in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| It's a general order, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| I was not told to do one in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| You do have a general orders notebook to govern your conduct as a police officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| And one of those orders, specifically general order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| does direct you to fill out all specified reports as generated by the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| If that's what it says, that's what it says, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| Did you make a written report in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| I wrote, I guess, personal notes immediately after and emailed a copy of my notes to Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:10| I did not fill out an official report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| And who did you email those to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| I'm sorry, the hour is late, I'm old, I'm hard of hearing, and my voice is dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Husky, H-U-S-K-E-Y?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Have you reviewed those notes prior to giving your testimony here this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| I don't have a copy with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| When did you look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| I'm sorry, did you say when did I look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| The past few days I've glanced at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| I'd call upon the hearing officer to order the Knoxville Police Department to produce those emailed notes and report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| that was generated by this witness that was used as a testimony as a witness in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| You may proceed with questioning the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| May I be heard on that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| You've made your record on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| You may proceed to cross-examine the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I think I've made my record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| My record is such, is that in administrative law hearings, in circuit court where they award money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:24| in divorce court or juvenile court where the state takes your children, or in criminal court where they take your liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:33| in every court in the United States, that request is upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| As a matter of due process of law, I would like a ruling as to why we are not entitled to a fair shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:48| Your request is overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| You're entitled to a fair shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| You're going to get a fair shake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| You may question the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| Would you please tell us who is in possession of those notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:10| I have a copy on my personal computer at home, and I also emailed the exact thing to Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| Is there an official file of the Knoxville Police Department on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| I would think there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I don't have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Who's in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Who's the case agent on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Who's in charge of this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I would think the Knoxville Police Department is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Officer Husky, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Now, the Knoxville Police Department has a lot of grants that are given to them and a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:53| Have you seen an instrument called a tape recorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| Have I ever seen a tape recorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| The Knoxville Police Department tape recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Have you ever seen such a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Have you ever used it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| While on patrol, I have, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Have you seen a video recording device?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Yes, sir, while on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Now, did you or any member of the Knoxville Police Department record any of this of what you're saying here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:31| Not that I'm aware of, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Did you do that personally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Now, there's a general order of the Knoxville Police Department that governs recording when it comes into contact with citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:53| Are you aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I am, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| That would be General Order 2.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Was that used in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| No, it was not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Stay pretty close to that microphone, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| Were you, as a law enforcement officer, trained in how to conduct an undercover, for lack of a better term, sting, I think is the term of art your agency uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:49| Other than the instructions that I was given the night before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Tell me those instructions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| I was told to present my true ID at the time, to have no other ID with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:10| Other than my profession, I was not to lie, not to say, you know, not to provide correct information other than my occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:21| In other words, if you were asked, are you a law enforcement officer, you were permitted to say, no, I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| But other than that, you were to say anything else that some person in the establishment asked you, you were to answer truthfully any questions put to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Is that all the training that you had in this particular operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Other than the instructions of the actions that we were to take, I was supposed to call them, you know, if we were struck that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Was this the one and only, quote, sting that you had participated in as a law enforcement officer, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| Do you know that the Knoxville Police Department has a policy that discusses underage stings to local establishments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:26| I was not personally aware of that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Well, in your training, in-service training, you do go to in-service training, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| I have not been to an in-service here yet in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I'm aware that they conducted them. That's about all I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Were you advised that under the Tennessee law that, well, strike it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| Let me start where it should start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Do you know why this young person who was with you, her name is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| Chrissy Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Ms. Key, who was apparently how old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| Eighteen years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Why the Knoxville Police Department had her issued a driver's license the day before this particular sting operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:27| I'm not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| members of this hearing panel were to look at that license, they will see it was issued the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:42| Did you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| She had told me after we got back to the station that she had recently renewed her license, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| And did you see the driver's license that she had before she was directed to go to Michaels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| and make a purchase of alcohol, beer, or wine, or liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I'm going to object to that question. He's assuming facts, not evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| There's no testimony that she was directed to get a new ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| I don't think the question assumed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| He asked her if she saw the license that she had prior to the license that she obtained the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| He asked if she saw the license that Chrissy Key was directed to get by KPD, and Chrissy Key was not directed to get a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| That's what our objection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Mr. Bell, would you like to rephrase the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Did you see her previous license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| The only ID I saw was the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Did you have it in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Well, we'll get it for you in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| David, could you read into the record the date of issuance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| 12-27-2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| What was the date of this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| 12-28-2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| You may return that back to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| Now, as part of the operations of the Knoxville Police Department, are you familiar with the fact that when you do these stings, you are supposed to hit more than one establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:25| I'm unaware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Is this the only establishment you went into that particular evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Is that the only establishment you ever went into on a sting operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| Did you consider, or do you know whether or not the city of Knoxville considered the fact that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2141)|
| 0:36:05| at a place called Cool Beans, do you know what Cool Beans is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:19| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Objection is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| As to the question about Cool Beans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| We cannot hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Did you consider Cool Beans, Liquids, Coyote Joes, Cumberland Taproot, the Red Iguana, Goodfellas 2234, Goodfellas 2240, Breakers, Electric Cowboy, Blue Cats, or other drinking establishments to strike a sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:51| I was told to go to Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Michael's alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Would it surprise you to know that at Michael's, the history of the 911 calls and the records from your very own agency shows that the officers initiated the incidents 42 times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2215)|
| 0:37:17| at least three times more than any other beer establishment or liquor establishment within the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:33| Objection is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| ICWO, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| ICWO versus United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| The objection is sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I don't think that's an appropriate question for this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I don't think you've laid any foundation for asking that question to this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:55| Would Your Honor like to read ICWO versus United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| No, Mr. Bell, I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| You may ask another question if you've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| If not, you may rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:12| Did you know that of all the various establishments in Knoxville, that all the other liquor and beer establishments have more fights, more investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:33| more DUIs, more domestic trouble, more juvenile problems, more disturbances, more suspicious persons, more assaults than any other than Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:47| Did you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| These other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Objection is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Did you know or were you aware that in addition to the officer initiated incidents at Michael's, which is 42 over a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2333)|
| 0:39:06| which is 3 to 1 over anybody else, that there were 19 walkthroughs of Michael's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:15| more than what happens at the Red Iguana where you have shootings, knifings, stabbings, raping, robbing, murders, pillaging, and plundering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:26| Objection is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Also sustained as to the fact that it was a multiply compound question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Did you know that Michael's had, within a represented period of time, 19 walkthroughs when the, for example, Goodfellas had none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:56| Objection is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Did you know that Michael's had 19 walkthroughs when the Red Iguana only had one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| Objection is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Well, I could go on, but I take it from the ruling and the objections that none of these statistical data is going to be allowed to be asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:30| Not to this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| There's no foundation for this witness to have that knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| It's irrelevant as to this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:43| Well, I said Yick Woe versus the United States, Your Honor. I misstated it. It's Yick Woe versus Hopkins. I misstated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I apologize and substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2454)|
| 0:41:07| Well, in your training, you were debriefed at roll call as to the trouble spots, are you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:16| Within the city, within your sector, east sector, downtown sector, west sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| So the areas that I asked you about would be within your patrol zone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2482)|

| 0:41:33| What patrol zone are you generally assigned to or assigned to at this time, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| Right now I'm in the FTO program. We're in the west district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| West district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Okay. Where Michaels is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Okay. So you're familiar with the number of other establishments in the west sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| And you're also debriefed as to which ones are having car break-ins, vandalisms, burglaries, raping, stabbing, the seamy side of life that occurs in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2515)|
| 0:42:08| Yes, sir. Certain areas, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Now, were you advised and have been advised, based upon your knowledge and response to what Mr. Swanson said, that Michaels was a particularly high spot for violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Were you told that Michaels was a particular high spot for public intoxicated individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| That Michaels frequently sold to underage individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| I don't recall being told that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Were you told that Michaels was a place that furnished alcohol to citizens and allowed them to drive under the influence of an intoxicant? You weren't told that, were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2571)|
| 0:43:07| I don't recall those exact words, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| So how was it you know that you were told, why was it Michaels was chosen on this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| I was not told the reason. I was told Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Just to do it. Just to do it. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| And like a good police officer, you follow orders of your superiors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Mr. Bell, you're wandering away from the microphone again a little bit. If you could...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| If I'm not to, Your Honor, I'm pretty well... I'm more aware of this mic here than I've been in any court in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| I understand. I wish we had a lapel mic for you, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:56| I hope none of these federal judges are watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| I doubt that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Probably in bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Yeah, that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| I'll hear about it in the next two weeks, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Okay, now under the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Before the sting occurred on Michaels with this particular young lady, Ms. Key, and yourself, were you searched before you went in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:38| My person? No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| Was she searched?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| You know that it is a standard operating procedure that if I'm going to make a purchase of an illegal substance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| whether it's marijuana, cocaine, cocaine hydrochloride, liquor, beer, whatever, that the undercover agent is searched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2693)|
| 0:45:03| make sure that they have no contraband, that they're checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| and that the person who accompanies them is likewise searched, inventoryed, is recorded, noted, charted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| They go in, make whatever purchase they buy, come back, research again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| to make sure that whatever was left there, whatever was acquired there, was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| Did that happen in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Is that the standard operating procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| You went in with $30. Did you make a record of how much money you came out with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| We each came out with what we went in with. We each had $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Was it marked? Marked money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| Was the money marked? I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Well, how do we know that? I mean, it wasn't recorded, it's not marked, it's not recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| This is different than any sting operation that's ever happened in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| Tell me how you all documented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Objection, argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Well, all right, let me rephrase it. I don't mean to be argumentative with you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| You've been a very good witness, and he ought to give you a raise tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| But how in the world did you document, and I know you were just doing what you were told, and I'm not picking on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| He'll probably have a new training program come tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Just ask the question, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Tell me, how did you document what you say happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| There's no recording, there's no copying of the money, there's nothing to corroborate any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| How, oh how, did the Knoxville Police Department conduct this operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| and deviate so far from their acceptable standards that they do in every case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| Objection. He's stating the law, and he's incorrectly stating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Additionally, he's being argumentative with the witness, and he's asked this question already, and she's answered this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| She wrote down her personal notes, and she emailed those to Donnie Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| The objection is sustained as to the argumentative nature of that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| You may question this witness with regard to what she knows about this, but try to do it in a non-argumentative fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| You came out with $30, and as I understand it, this Ms. Key came out with $30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Do you remember that exactly, notes, no notes, as being the naked, unvarnished truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:56| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| That's my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:13| Tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Nah, just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Did you have a credit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:30| I don't recall if I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| Now, did you drink your drink? Did you consume the alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| I had a sip of my drink in front of me while I was waiting for Officer Husky to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Was it a good drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Objection relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Well, did it have alcohol in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Was it a good drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Objection relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Did you taste Ms. Key's beverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Did she taste it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| No, she did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Did you seize it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| You didn't pay for it. You went in with $30. She went in with $30. You walked out of it. She didn't drink it. You didn't charge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:25| Is there a question here somewhere you want answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Yes. My question is, was it at that point that you got on your cell phone and called for backup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:37| When she said the drinks in front of us and Chrissy Key went to the bathroom, I made the call at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| Officer Husky came in, and we left at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Read erect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| We have no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| At this point, I would ask the beer board members if there are any questions for clarification that you would like for me to ask this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| Seeing none, the witness may be excused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| Does anyone anticipate recalling this witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| I don't know until we see what the proof is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| All right. If you'll just wait outside with the rest of the witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| I hate to do that. She's been very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| It's all right. Just needed to know. Counsel, call your next witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| Our next witness is Explorer Chrissy Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| Got somebody to get her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| The officer is getting her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| We don't have a bailiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:58| You want one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:42| I would remind the members of the beer board, please do not discuss anything regarding the case that you're hearing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| We aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| We're just picking on the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| It's quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Just a reminder while we're waiting for the witness to take the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| Is Ms. Key coming in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3124)|

| 0:52:12| All right. Would you have a seat right there, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| You may ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| Would you please state your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| My name is Kristen Key, but you can call me Chrissy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you. And you're an Explorer with the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3144)|

| 0:52:47| Mr. Bell, did you say something I needed to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| I told her I would stipulate in a self-explanatory document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3170)|
| 0:53:00| That wasn't something you needed to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| Chrissy, did you already say what your birth date was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| And that's your birth certificate before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| And Mr. Bell does not object to that exhibit, so we'd ask that there be the next marked exhibit, number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| It will be received as City Exhibit number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| And so you just recently turned 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Where do you go to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| I go to Christian Academy of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| And what grade are you in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| I'm a senior, 12th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| So you graduate this spring then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Were you born here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| No, I was born in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| And when did you move here to Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| It was when I was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| And how did you come to volunteer with the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| When I was on one of my school trips, we had two deputy sheriffs come, and I'd always been interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:58| and they just got me interested, told me about the post, and then I came into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| And so you are an explorer with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| What exactly is an explorer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| An explorer is a voluntary position where we just assist officers with DUI checkpoints and football games and other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:18| And before December 28, 2006, had you ever been involved in an undercover beer sting before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| So this sting at Michael's was the first time that you'd worked with the inspections unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| Where did you go first on the night of December 28, 2006 when you arrived at the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| Where did you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| I was in the inspections unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| And who was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| It was Officer Husky, Officer McNutt, and Agent Jason Poore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| They were all in the room, along with Officer Matiuk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| Jennifer Matiuk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| And what were you wearing that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| I was wearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| The exact same outfit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| I hate to do this to you, but could you stand up so the board members can see your entire outfit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| Would the record please reflect that the witness is standing and showing the members of the beer board the outfit that she is wearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| And it's a blazer with a turtleneck and pants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Same clothes, same makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Anything else, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| I object to that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Would the hearing officer make a ruling as to what he guessed her age to be before she hit the stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:41| No, Mr. Bell, I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| Go ahead and sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| I'm sorry, Chrissy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And the night that you were there in the inspections unit, did you have your wallet with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| And do you have that same wallet here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Can you pull that wallet out for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| And would you mind opening that wallet up and showing the board members where you keep your driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| And you may need to hold that up a little bit high for the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Please let the record reflect that she has opened a green wallet and is showing it to the members of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Mr. Bell, is there anything else the record needs to reflect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| Rather than look at it, may I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:47| Now, recognizing that you're going to get an opportunity to cross-examine, is there anything else the record needs to reflect at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Could you pull up her microphone there if you're going to talk right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| I would like for the record to show, please, that, and maybe you can describe it better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| but there appears to be charge cards and other business records in this document that would –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:23| You mean in the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Does the city have any objection to the record reflecting that the wallet also contains other business cards and documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| I may have a way of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Perhaps we could just take it and make a copy of it like this, make a copy of that upside down as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| I don't know if it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Does the city have any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| The city has no objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| That's how it looks tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| Does the city have any other notations for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| And that driver's license that you showed to the veer board that's inside that wallet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| is that the same driver's license that you had with you that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| And you had it in that pocket sleeve of the wallet just as you do tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Do you have any other photo identification in your wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| And did you have any other photo identification with you that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Ms. Key, could you get just a little closer to that microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| You have a really light voice and it's having trouble picking you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| I think it is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| And when you were in the inspections unit that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| did Officer Husky ask you about your identification you had in your wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| He asked me if that was the only identification I had and my wallet was laying open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| so he saw that there was nothing else in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| And so you confirmed that that was your driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| and that was your only ID with you that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| Speaking of your driver's license, when was that driver's license issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| It was very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I got it, I think it was two days before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| So it would be the 26th, I'm most positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| And can you look at that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| and tell me the date that it was issued to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Excuse me, it was the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Was that the day before the undercover sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| And why did you go and get a new license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| My old license was when I was from 16, and I wanted to get it renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| So that you'd look more like you do today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| While you were at the inspections unit, did you speak with Officer Husky about the sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| And what else happened other than the discussion about the sting while you were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Well, we went and then he told me everything that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| We were going to go in, order our drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| and he told me to show my real identification and that I couldn't have a fake ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| and I agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| And then he also told me that I could not lie about anything except where I did work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| So you were told not to lie about your age if asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| And you were told to show your proper ID, your legal ID, if asked for your ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Was your picture taken at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| And who took that picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| What happened once you left the inspections unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| We walked to, I think it was the rear parking lot of the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| and me and Officer Matiuk got into an unmarked vehicle and drove to Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3648)|
| 1:01:00| And was Officer Matiuk with you the entire time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Well, we left together and then the time that we left after the sting, we were together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| And she drove with you to Michael's then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Once you and Officer Matiuk arrived at Michael's, what did you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| We went into the restaurant and we sat down at a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Like there was no one there, just people were at the bar, but no one was at any of the tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| And we sat down and looked at our menus to see what we wanted to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| We had a plan of what we were going to order, but I still wanted to look at the menus that were already on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| and decided what we were going to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| And so what did you decide to order that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| I ordered a Merlot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| And did you know what a Merlot was before that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| How did you decide on a Merlot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| There was some special going on that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| It was like ladies' night or something like that on the menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| And I looked at that and I was like, well, you know, I decided to order that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| And so I ordered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| And so once you decided what to order, did a server approach your table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| She ended up coming to our table and asked us what we would like to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| And then Officer Matejek ordered, and then I ordered my drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| And then she asked for our IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| She checked Officer Matejek's first, and then she looked at mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| And when you say she looked at your ID, did you take your ID out of your wallet at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| I just showed her, like I held on to my wallet and showed her my ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| She did not take it out, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| And so she looked at the ID through that clear sleeve in the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Then what did she do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| And then she left to go get our drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| What happened next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| We waited and just talked for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| And then she ended up coming back with our drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| And then Officer Matejek asked for some menus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| I think it was appetizer menus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| And I think they were really close because I remember having, she just brought them right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| And so she left, and then I went to the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| And when the server set down your glass, was it a wine glass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| And it was served right in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| She put it to my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| And did Officer Matejek get her glass right in front of her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Officer Matejek was sitting to my right, and the server came up to my left, and she put it kind of in the middle of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| But your drink was right next to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| Where did you go once you got it from the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| Once I got it from the table, I went to the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| And why did you go to the bathroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| The officers wanted me to go to the restroom just because I'm not a sworn officer, to protect me just in case anything happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| And so what happened next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| So I went to the restroom and waited for a few minutes, and then Officer Matejek came in to get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| And we decided to go out through not a side entrance, but not the way that we had come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Well, it was the way that we had come in, but it was through a different room to get to the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| And so we walked out, and as we were walking out, Officer Husky asked me for my ID again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| And he said that he would give it back to me, and then that we should meet him at Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| And did you give Officer Husky the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| I did. I gave him the one that was in my wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| The same one that you had that whole entire evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Yes, the one I showed the waitress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| And is that the same ID that's in the color copy in front of you? I think it's labeled Exhibit 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| With the red under 21 on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| Once you left Michaels with Officer Matejek, what did you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| We went to Weigel's to wait for the officers to come out because they had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| I'm not quite sure what they were doing. I think it was issuing the citation, just talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| And then they met us at Weigel's, and then we went back to the department where they took my picture again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:09| And then they said it was all right for me to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| And from the time you got your picture taken the first time to the time you left Michaels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| and got your picture taken the second time, had your appearance changed in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I know your hair is curly today. Was it curly that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| It wasn't because for Christmas I ended up getting a perm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| So it was a straight haircut that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Same as your driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:51| I believe you stated earlier that the server asked to see your ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| But you did not take the ID out of your billfold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I did not. It was in there the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Did she ask you to take the ID out of your billfold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| No, she didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| She just looked at it right there in the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| Ms. Key, I'm going to ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| If I ask you something you don't understand, ask me please to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| Can we have that agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| The role of an explorer is not that as an employee of the city of Knoxville or the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| The role of an explorer is principally to assist post-certified law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| and reserve officers in the mechanical operation of their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| And in point of fact, there's a webpage provided by the city of Knoxville about the role of an explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:05| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| And you've read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| And nowhere on that webpage does it say that you would participate in an undercover sting operation, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:18| I am not sure. I haven't paid that much attention. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| I'd ask counsel to take judicial notice of the city of Knoxville webpage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| if you've got your own webpage, about that of an explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| I'm going to object to relevance, and I certainly haven't seen the webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| I don't think these billboard members have seen the webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| If you would like to copy off the webpage and provide it as an exhibit, I think we would receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| But otherwise, we're not going to take judicial notice of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| No, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4070)|
| 1:08:09| The clothing you're wearing is not the kind of clothing you wear to school, to high school, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| The clothing you're wearing is something you would wear if you were going to an adult-type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| or a professional law enforcement-type meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| You don't wear those around your contemporaries, those type of clothing that you're wearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:46| In some cases, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Are law enforcement connected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| The reason why I ask that, do you own a lot of clothes that look like what you're wearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| Not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Most of your clothing is more fitting for your own age group, 18 years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:20| Can you please recite the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| And I apologize for not communicating well with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:31| When you get to be my age, it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| The clothing you're wearing is not that what folks 18 years of age wear traditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:48| I believe that, I don't know if that's correct, because a lot of people don't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| there's not like a certain, I don't know, I don't, it depends like what people like to wear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| So it's not my style, but I know that there are people that wear things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| In business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| And you're in high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| And were you told that the requirements of the Tennessee Code demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| that you not purposely disguise your appearance by clothing or otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| so as to misrepresent or purport to misrepresent your actual age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Were you told that you cannot make any statements designed to trick, mislead, encourage, or confuse the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:48| It wasn't that specific, but they did tell me that I wasn't supposed to lie about my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| I would ask the hearing officer to take judicial notice of Tennessee Code Annotated 3915.4.13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4254)|
| 1:11:04| that prohibits a minor or person under the age of 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| shall not purposely disguise their appearance as to misrepresent the person's actual age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:17| or make statements designed to trick, mislead, encourage, or confuse the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| Counsel, do you have any objection to taking judicial notice of the state statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| It's the law, so we don't object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| But if he's going to use it as evidence, I guess we'd ask that they provide it to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| Would you agree that it was correctly read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:48| It's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Tell me where it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| It's technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| He said purposely disguise the person's appearance as to misrepresent, and he left out a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| So, so as to misrepresent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| So as, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| It will be received as corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Now, I was able to get your motor vehicle results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| It also has some information about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| and I'm not asking you, ma'am, these questions to embarrass you or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| It's just basically for purposes of this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| It says that your height is 5'9", and I know it's not nice to state your weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| but the weight that's represented on your driver's license is your true weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| So you appear to be a fully developed, as the pathologist would say, well-nourished white female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| You would agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Now, may I approach the witness again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| You've asked her to see your driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| She's trying to get to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Pull the microphone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| It's up like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Can we do dueling microphones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Your driver's license is in a red-striped, pink-striped, dark green-striped, and light green, lime-striped purse, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| When you open it up, can I just take this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| Is this the exact position where your red stripe was on the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| It was either this way or flopped over, but I do not remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| It's really difficult, and the police officers did not make a copy of that, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| No, but they did copy my license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| They did not, not in the wallet, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Out of the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| May I just pass it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| You can watch me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| May I pass this through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Now, can you tell the members of the hearing panel where the red line is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| You've got a whole lot of people down at your table down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Why don't you let one of those people take it around while you go back to the podium and ask questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:29| Back to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| All the way to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| It's not picking you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Just hold it out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Now, what I'm referring to here as I ask you these questions, as they're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| there is a green protective cover that obscures the red line that says under 21, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4490)|
| 1:15:00| Depending on the way I put it in my wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| And you cannot tell the members of this committee how it was put in your billfold that particular evening, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| The lady did ask you for an identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| And you produced one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| You did not take it out of your billfold like your fellow officer voluntarily did, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:54| Now, I observe that your date of birth is 11-18-88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4554)|
| 1:16:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| When was your old license up for renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| Please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| It wasn't going to be expired anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| I do not remember when it was expired, but it wasn't expired before I did get my new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:31| When did you have your old license photograph made, when you were 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| When I was 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| And so it didn't have anything to do with this particular case to have it done the day before this particular sting to have a new photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:51| I did need to get it redone because it had everything when I was 16, and I knew I needed to get it renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| Well, not renewed, but I just wanted to get a new relevant picture, and I knew I was doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| Your address was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| I've got your old address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| You left the same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| I'm not publicly going to say what it is, but it's the same address, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| The information is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Your height hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Your weight hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Your haircut hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Your eyes hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Your sex hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Your date of birth hadn't changed, and your race hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| The only thing that was changed was your appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| And also on the green line on my license, it had restricted written on it, and now it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| When was that restriction lifted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| I'm not sure, but it is now not on my license, so sometime between when I was 16 and now 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| Well, actually, it never was restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| It was to expire 11-18-2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| I'm not quite sure what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| It did say something about being restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| You never had a restricted license, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| Sir, can you explain what restricted means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| You told me you had a restricted license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| You never had a restricted license, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| That's not what she testified to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| She said it had the word restricted on her license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Well, that means that she had a restricted license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Did you have a restricted license, or did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| If that's what it means, I think I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| It did say restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| That's why I was thinking that it was a restricted license, but I'm not sure quite what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| Where did it say restricted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Where did it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| It said it on the green banner where it says driver's license right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| But you have no traffic infractions that cause your license to be called into question by the Tennessee Department of Safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:59| Mr. Bell, if you'll study the law, I believe you'll discover that when you're 16 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| you're restricted in a number of ways until you turn 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| and all the 16-year-old licenses are restricted in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| The law requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| But her testimony is she got one when she was 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| And she said it was restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| And then when she got 18, she wanted to get one unrestricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| She did not testify in that fashion, but she may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Now, where is your old license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| I do not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| I'm not quite sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| At home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Did you give it to law enforcement as evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| Now, you're a young lady, single and dating, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4790)|
| 1:20:02| I've got some relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| I can make it relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Are you dating Gus Pedousis's son?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Now, he's been with you in a hearing in Chantry Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| and he's been with you at different at the night even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| So I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| I have a reasonable basis to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| And I'm fully entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| I'm not trying to embarrass you, but since he's in charge of this operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I think that's a reasonable inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| No, we're not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| I understand that he has been here with you and been escorting you at both hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| this one and the one last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| He has come because his father is one of the deputy chiefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| and he's interested, but he's not been escorting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:18| If you had gone into Michaels with the word restriction written across your license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| there's no way you would have been served by anybody, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| Objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| You went into Michaels with $30, and you came out with $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| You went in with a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| You did not take the credit card out and use it to purchase whatever it was you purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| You did not taste the beverage that was in the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Well, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4914)|
| 1:22:06| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Real quickly, Chrissy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| It's not your responsibility to check the ID on your wallet, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| There's an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| You need to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| There's one microphone right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| It may work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| I object to her leading her very own witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| She's testifying on behalf of her very own witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| I object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| He asked her under cross-examination if she took the ID out and showed her the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| and said you were required to provide a true ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| So I'm asking her a question whether or not it's her responsibility to check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| And I don't think I'm leading by asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Ask the question one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| It's not your responsibility to check your ID when serving drinks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| That is leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| Fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| It's easy to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Whose responsibility is it to check IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| The server's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Not yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Do you have your wallet in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Mr. Bell asked you if you knew which way the picture was facing, right or left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| Your photo was face-up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| And so when you look at your ID in the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| It's a series of questions leading the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| I'm asking her to perform a demonstration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| I'm not sure I'm leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| I'm going to overrule that because it's a preliminary issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| I don't think it's a real issue as to whether or not it was face-up or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| But be careful not to lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| If you would look down at your license and it's face-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| can you see the entire date of your birth without wiggling it back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| No, I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| And if you wiggle it to see the date, what happens to the red bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| It disappears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| And if you wiggle it the other way, what happens to the red bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| The red bar comes into view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| So as it's placed right now, can you see the red bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| I hate to do this to you because I know it's hard to take that ID out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Would you mind pulling it out of your wallet and turning it the opposite direction, keeping it face-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:30| Let the record reflect that the witness is maneuvering the license in the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| And now you're looking at the wallet with the opposite direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| And when you wiggle that ID, can you see the entire birth date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| But you can't see the red bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| So in order to see the entire ID, you have to move it back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| And when you move it back and forth, can you see the red bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5095)|
| 1:25:07| Can't really move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| But yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Would you mind, and I hate to do this to you, handing that wallet over to the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| so they can see how the ID looks but you can't see the date and the red bar at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| No, I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| Let the record reflect that the wallet has been passed to the members of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| to look at the positioning of the license in the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| Is there anything else the record needs to note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| Is there a recross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| That's all the questions we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Is there a recross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| I'll ask for clarification questions after they're finished with the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:59| While we're doing that, may I request a five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| We've been at it for about two hours and 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| Let's recess until 1023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| We're going to take a 15-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:50| We're at the point where we have completed the examination of this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5210)|
| 1:27:13| Do any of the beer board members have any questions for clarification on this witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:49| And the question is, what date was she informed that she was going to be asked to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| Can you answer that question, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| I do not remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| She does not recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Any other questions for clarification, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I'll ask my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| You'll probably have to interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Did the witness see it as a rite of passage to have a new driver's license issued without the word restricted on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:21| Should I give an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| The hearing officer is going to rule that that's more than clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| That's opening a whole new line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| I don't believe we need to open that line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| So I'm going to respectfully overrule that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| As a result of the question that was asked by Mr. Brown, are there any questions that need to be asked of this witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:49| The city has none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| See these lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Briefly, did you know about the staying before or after you got your license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Before you got your license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Ms. Roddy, I think I did not see your light, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| Do you have a question for clarification purposes that needs to be posed to this witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:30| You withdraw the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| I think we're done then with this witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| You may call your next witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Just for the record, she probably does need to stay around for a recall in case it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| If you'd just wait right outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| His call to make, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| Our next witness is Officer Husky, the bear inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| I'm sorry, who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Officer Donnie Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Donnie Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| Officer Husky, you were previously sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| You may ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Would you state your full name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Donnie Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Where are you currently employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| How long have you been with the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| What is your current position with the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| I'm the bear inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| How long have you been with the Knoxville Inspections Unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| I believe since November the 29th of 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| And in your position in the inspections unit, have you participated in underage sting operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Can you explain to the board member the very briefest way possible how a sting operation works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| We take an individual that's under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| We like to use our own personnel, whether that be a cadet or an explorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| And we bring them into the inspections office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| By state law, I'm required to take a photograph before our operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| and I will write on the board behind them the date and time I take it so it gets it in the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| I explain to them that they're to show their state-issued ID if asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| They're to have no other IDs on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| I issue them money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| I tell them that the only thing that they can be untruthful about is their employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| or why they are engaged in the job they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| Other than that, they have to be truthful and tell the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| How many underage stings have you participated in over the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Probably 15 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| And on this particular night, December 28th, did the KPD inspections unit conduct an underage sting at Michaels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| And so what did you do first on that night, December 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| We met in the inspections office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| It was myself, Officer McNutt, Agent Poore, the Alcohol and Beverage Commission, Jennifer, Mattiak, and Chrissy Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:07| And approximately what time did you meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| About 5.30 in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| Once everyone was there at the inspections office, what did you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| I instructed Jennifer and Chrissy to take any other forms of ID off their person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:25| And I took Chrissy's driver's license and made a photocopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| And is that the same driver's license that, I don't know if Exhibit 5 is in front of you right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Is Exhibit 5 up there, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| It's a driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| I don't have the one with the exhibit number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Mr. Kizer took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:53| We've got it, but we don't have the one that's marked as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Where is the one that's marked as an exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| All right, let's not lose track of the exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Let's see if we can find that exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| Any of the beer board members have an exhibit with an identification sticker on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| Mr. Bell, you have it over at your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| All right, let's substitute another one and mark it with a sticker, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:42| Have you marked that as City's Exhibit Number 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Like the last witness took it with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Is that driver's license ID that you're looking at that's been marked as Exhibit 5 the ID that you saw that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5634)|
| 1:34:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Is that the same ID you took a photocopy of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| And I believe you explained earlier in your general procedure about how to conduct an underage sting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| that you explained to them what they can and cannot lie about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Did you explain that to Officer Explorer Key that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| Yes, ma'am, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| So what did you tell her about what to say if she was asked about her age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| She used to give her true age if she's asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| And after the discussion with Chrissy Key and Jennifer Matejek about the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:40| what were they to do if there was a sale at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| I instructed Chrissy to go to the restroom and for one of them to call me on the cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| They both had my number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| And so what happened after you left the inspections office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| Me and Agent Poore rode in a vehicle together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Officer McNutt drove his patrol car and Chrissy and Jennifer took an unmarked car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| And we followed each other down Nayland Drive and we got to Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| and Jennifer and Chrissy passed us and was going on to Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| And so Chrissy Key was with Officer Matejek the entire time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| Where did you go at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| We went to a parking lot that was close to Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| And what did you do until you were called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| Just parked there and waited until one of them called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| And so who called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| And what did she tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| She told me that they had a sale to come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| I said, come on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| She goes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| So we proceeded to Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| And where did you park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| In a parking spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| At Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Went inside and located Jennifer at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| And what did you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| What did Jennifer do and you do after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| I walked up to Jennifer and I asked her to point out the waitress or the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| And she pointed her out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| And I said, come on up here towards the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| So we walked up towards the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| I had Agent Poore go get Jennifer or go get the waitress and bring her up to where we were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| Did you just say that we walked up to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| It was you and Officer Matiuk that walked up to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| And Officer Poore walked in Michael's with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| And he went and got the server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| And this was the server that Officer Matiuk pointed out to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| What happened after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| At some point I had Jennifer go get Chrissy out of the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And both of them come out and I asked Chrissy for her driver's license again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| And she handed it to me and I told them they could go on and leave the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| And this identification that you got from Chrissy Key, is that the same identification that's marked as Exhibit 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| And did you show that ID to the server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| What was the server's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| I believe it's pronounced Michaela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| I can spell the last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| It's Hoogaboom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| And at that point in time what did you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| I took the ID that Chrissy gave me and I showed it to the waitress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| And what did she say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| She said, she told me, I thought it said 19-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| Hold on, wait until we resolve the objection, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| What's the objection that it's hearsay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| She's an employee of Michael's, it's a statement against interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| No, it's not a statement against interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Is it offered for the truth of the matter asserted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Then why is it not hearsay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| It's an exception to the hearsay rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| She's an employee of Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| And by asking her whether or not she looked at the ID, that's a statement against interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| If she looked at the ID and the ID shows that Chrissy was under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| then that shows that she looked at the proper ID, we comply with the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| and she's sold to an underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| So it is a statement against interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| Do you have something else you wanted to add, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Yes, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| The Confrontation Clause of the federal and the state constitution prohibits such matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:20| plus the celebrated case of Crawford v. Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| that has caused lawyers more headaches than this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| This statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| and because of that, and this is a quasi-civil criminal litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:45| as defined by the United States Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| we say that Crawford does apply or the plurality decision of Roberts v. Ohio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:57| interpreting the Confrontation Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| Under any combination of either one, it is still in the words of layman hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5941)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| In the hearing officer's opinion, this is strictly a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| It is not a quasi-criminal matter at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| It is strictly a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| This sounds to me like potentially a statement against penal interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| as a result of which it is an exception to the hearsay rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| and your objection is overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I'm not sure you ever got to answer that question, so let me ask it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| When you showed Ms. Huggaboom Ms. Key's ID, what did she say to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| I said to her, I said to the waitress, right here's her ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| and she looked at it and said, oh, I thought it said 1983, instead of 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5986)|
| 1:39:54| So she admitted to checking Ms. Key's ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| What happened after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| I asked her for her identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| I took both the identifications and put them up on top of my clipboard so I could see them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| I had really not met Chrissy before, so I wanted to make sure I spelled her name right also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:20| So I put them both up there and I started writing the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| At this point, Agent Poore was speaking, I believe, to the manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| and the waitress asked me if I would write that on the citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| that she looked at the ID and thought it said 83, and I told her I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| Permission to approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6041)|
| 1:41:11| Officer Husky, is this the citation that you issued to Ms. Huggaboom that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| And when you stated just a moment ago that she asked you to write that comment on the citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| did you in fact write that comment on the citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Can you read that to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| I wrote the suspect looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Could you use the microphone right there or either one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| We would object in that this constitutes a report, a police report, law enforcement report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| and a citation and it does not come in by Tennessee statute as evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| It's like an accident report or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| It's not admissible by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| I believe it's a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| It's not an accident report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| That's what's excluded by state statute is an accident report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| This isn't an accident report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| This is not an accident report, is it, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| Are you saying a citation is excluded by the statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| It is a document generated by a law enforcement agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| which I believe I could be wrong hours late and I don't have my statute in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:40| We were never given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| Be that as it may, I object to it coming in as substantive evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| Number one, he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| Number two, the report is hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| It's a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| It's a charging instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| It doesn't come in as substantive evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| No more than a complaint would be filed before a jury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| or an indictment would be entered as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| I really believe that if it's a citation that's issued contemporaneous with the charge in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| I believe it's admissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| And so I'm going to overrule your objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| It will be received as city's exhibit number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| Going back to the citation, after you, while you were writing the citation to Ms. Huggaboom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| did you speak with her at length about what happened that evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| Yes, ma'am, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| And what did she say to you about serving Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| At one point, I asked out loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| and I directed my question towards Agent Poore, who was talking with the manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| exactly what the alcohol was classified as, whether it be liquor, wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| I didn't know at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| You're talking about the word Merlot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| You didn't know what Merlot was at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| And what did she say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| She said it was wine, and then I asked her how to spell it, and she spelled it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| So she admitted to serving Christie Key wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| We still object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| You claim that she is an agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Her agency relationship is to act as a server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| Her agency relationship is not to be a spokesman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| or to make management statements on behalf of Michaels, a corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| That may be a distinction that you may find without a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| but it is an important distinction, we believe, that should be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:51| Your objection is duly noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| but it's being received as a statement against this individual's penal interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| as opposed to in some capacity, representative capacity, and is overruled on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| And because it's against her penal interest, it doesn't come in as substantive evidence against Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:13| This is not a conspiracy count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| This is not an aiding and abetting charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| This is a charge of underage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| And so the admissibility as to one person would not be admissible as to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| which is what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| And for that reason, we again renew our objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| I understand your objection, and I appreciate it, and I overrule it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| So after she explained to you that Merlot was a whine, that she had served to Chrissy Key that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| did you talk to her about anything else that evening while you were writing the citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| At some point she recognized me, and then I did recognize her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| and she brought up the fact that she had just went to our alcohol class at the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| just a couple of weeks prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| And I did recognize her from that class because I'm the administrator of the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| I don't teach it, but I take up the registration they sign in at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| I take their money up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| I do the administrative part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| Did you ask her if she was busy that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| What was her reply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| As I was writing the citation, I asked her if she was busy and if she wanted to go back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| and I could finish writing the citation, then I'd come and get her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| And she said no, that was my only table I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| And so when she said she recognized you and you recognized her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| it was from that Ask class that was back in December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| And we're asking that Mr. Pizer be allowed to approach with the next marked Exhibit 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6405)|

| 1:47:08| Did you provide a copy to Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6430)|

| 1:47:22| I'm just asking if you have it, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| And who's the first name on the first page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| It's Michaela Hoogerboom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| She signed in at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| This first sheet is what we keep outside at our teleserve where normal citizens can walk up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| And we have a sign-in sheet, and she signed in at 8 a.m. that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| And this is the same person that you cited at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6466)|

| 1:47:48| What's the next sheet of paper in that collective exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| The next sheet is a class registration sheet that I pass around once I get everyone down to the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| and they fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| And is Michaela Hoogerboom's name on that sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| Yes, ma'am, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| And it's in the left-hand column?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| How many names down is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| And what is the business that she's working for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| And what is the third sheet of paper in collective exhibit 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| It's a student registration card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| And do they fill that out as part of attending the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| And who is the employer listed for Michaela Hoogerboom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| And then the last sheet of paper, when is that document filled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| Which one, the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| The class roster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| That is filled out after the class is complete and we get the test scores back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| This sheet is filled out and faxed to both the ABC offices in Knoxville and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:55| And according to this document, Michaela Hoogerboom took the test and received a 94?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| And she was coming in for establishment at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| We'd ask that this be the next exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| Mr. Bell, is there an objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| There's no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| Let the record reflect that there's no objection to the receiving of that as exhibit number 8, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| City Exhibit Number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| Any objection to allowing the members of the Beer Board to pass the copies they have around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| The answer to that was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Officer Husky, do you know a Miss Melanie Carlisle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Who is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| She's a special agent with the TBI lab here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| So she's actually located here in Knoxville, Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| It looks like if you review the last exhibit that was introduced, sir, the young lady that was an employee of Michael's at the time of this sting finished next to last in her class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:27| That document's been taken away, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| I'm going to furnish him with that document, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Let's get the original document back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:46| Now, the ASK program is a program offered by the Knoxville Police Department to various permit holders of beer and alcohol businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6646)|
| 1:51:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| as to the legal and proper method, and it's a voluntary program, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:16| Voluntary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Well, as to which program you attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| In other words, they offer one at the Knoxville Police Department, various other organizations offer a similar type program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| I think there are some other teachers out there, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Yes, under different names, but whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| And the Knoxville Police Department feels like it has the model for this type of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| The model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Yeah, it's kind of the model program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| It's a state program, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| Right. It's the model program, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| It's a state program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| It's not our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Yeah, but it's administered by your agency as well as other agencies throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| I would say other agencies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| I know there's individuals that teach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| I'm not aware of any other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| Be that as it may, Michaels sent this young lady to your program, and however she ended up, she took it and was trained by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:19| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Or by your people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| By an officer at the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| When I say you, I mean your agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| Now, the purpose of that, of course, is to ferret out undercover, I'm not undercover, but underage purchasers of beer or wine or whiskey, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:49| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| And the other part of it is to alert an individual, a server, if you will, as to what an impaired person or intoxicated person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6770)|
| 1:53:01| Sir, I cannot get into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| I do not teach the class, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| I just take up the registration paperwork and I deal with the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| Have you had the class yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| Now, does the Knoxville Police Department have a program that governs, a general order that governs sting operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:35| They do, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| Are you talking about underage stings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Do you have a protocol that you use in a sting operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| We go by that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Do you have a program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| That state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| That's all there is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| Have you been involved in other sting operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| I have asked the city to provide to me and they haven't done so yet, but you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6845)|
| 1:54:33| out of the various stings that occurred in the city, that virtually every one of the individuals carted the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:54| Objection, that's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| How is it relevant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| It shows that their operation, and I'm prepared to do this to an expert, that I plan on showing some other things later on connected up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:11| but that not only do they, that these folks cart these individuals and other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:21| but that oftentimes the appearance of the license produced is later misread in a manner that was done in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| So you're asking him as to the stings that he's participated in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| As to the stings he's participated in, what is the specific question you're asking him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| That of the stings you've participated in, for example, may I approach the witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Can I see a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| You can accompany him up to the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| For example, Brian Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| Mr. Bell, if we can find a microphone where you can do the doing microphone things again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Brian Patrick Perry, Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| Thought the ID said 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| Jackson, as to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Is this a sting that he participated in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| That's a sting you participated in, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| I'm on there as a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Eddie Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Overruled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Eddie Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| Entered the place, asked the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| The cadet produced an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| I'm still going to object to his relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Whether he participated in the sting or not, he hasn't shown how it's relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| We've got all of these where these IDs were misread, or there was a cadet producing IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7016)|
| 1:57:07| I want you to tell me in your operation, officer, why, oh, why, all these servers who undergo these operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:17| your classes continuously, yes, continuously, repeatedly, habitually misread the age of the server as being 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:42| Objection. That's a speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Well, in your training, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Do you know of an instance, several incidents, within the Knoxville Police Department where the cadet goes in and shows two different IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7069)|
| 1:58:01| In other words, they go in and show the server one ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| They leave the premises and come out and show another ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| I'm not aware of that, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| If that were to be shown to you on film, would you be willing to make an arrest for obstruction of justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:21| Objection as to relevance to this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Would you agree that that is a violation of state and federal law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Objection to relevance to this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| That does happen by your office, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| Objection as to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| No, I think he's asking if that happens in his office, whether or not they show two IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| I think that is, in fact, a relevant question, and so I'm going to allow him to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Can you ask me the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| In your office, your cadets have historically, in the past, traditionally used two different identifications in order to accomplish a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7130)|
| 1:59:01| I have not seen that, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Well, all right, I'll let that be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:13| I'll come back to it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Did you search the person of this cadet or cause to have her be searched by a female officer to make sure she didn't have two IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:26| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Did you search the person of the uniformed officer, the lady female officer, to make sure she didn't have an additional ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Did you search her for money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Did you furnish money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Did you Xerox the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Did you count the money when you got it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| Did you make a record of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Did you chart it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| Where's the chart? Where's the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| It's on my computer, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| You don't have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| Have you generated a report about this operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| What type of report are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| This particular operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| What type of report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Any type of report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| An after-action report is what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| An after-action report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| Did you generate an after-action report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| I have a sheet that the explorer cadet or the underage person that we use fills out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| It pertains to whether they were carded or not, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| Did you fill out an after-action report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| We filled out that sheet, if that's what you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| But that's not what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| Have you given it to the city's lawyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| I'm not sure if she has that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| We would call upon the city to produce that, if it pleases the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:48| We're not in the middle of discovery, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| No, we're here in the middle of a trial by ambush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| That's what we're in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7254)|

| 2:01:11| It's tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| Prior to this hearing today, have you requested in writing that the report be furnished to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| No, what witnesses they were going to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| The charges, this goes back to what we started at when we started at 6 o'clock this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:24| No, I don't have such notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| All right. Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7287)|
| 2:01:35| Did you purposely not allow the uniformed officer, the post-certified officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:54| to wear a tape recorder in to validate the integrity of this alleged violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7314)|
| 2:02:02| Sir, we haven't used one of those in any of the stings that I've been a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| I didn't ask you if you used one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| I said, did you do that purposely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| You have it available, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| I don't have one, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| You don't have a tape recorder in your section of the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| To use for that kind of operation, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| Well, who has one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| I guess organized crime, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Would you get one if you wanted it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| I probably could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7347)|

| 2:02:31| You know they're available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| I probably could get one if they're not using them, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd2?start=7353)|
