| 0:01:58| Thank you, Mr. Moyers. At this time, I would like to welcome Mr. Jeff Welch, our new director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning, to our zoning meeting today. Mr. Welch, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=118)|
| 0:02:12| Madam Clerk, please read the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| This is item number 61, 8-G-22-SP. It's a request of Castello Homes, LLC, for South County Sector Plan Amendment from G.C. General Commercial to LDR Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=135)|
| 0:02:30| The property is located at 0 Collar Drive, parcel ID 137-DA-010 and 137-225-02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=150)|
| 0:02:42| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Sir, would you please approach the podium, state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=166)|
| 0:02:58| Hello, my name is Frankie Ramos. My address is 1581 Pine Ridge Road, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| Thank you for being here. Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| Seeing none, I will look to our new director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you. Planning Commission action was to approve the Sector Plan Amendment to Low Density Residential because it is compatible with adjacent development by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=199)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Sir, would you like to speak to your project? Or is there anything you would like the Commission to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| I don't really have anything much to add. I just would like for the zoning change to be per the Planning Commission's report of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you. I will look to... Are there any questions or discussions? Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Costello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| What are you planning to do with this 0.750 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I was to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Can you speak to Lockheed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Yeah, absolutely. Just wanted to build a couple of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Two houses or one house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Two houses in a neighborhood that's probably an acre, acre lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| From what I saw, it was from at most three-quarters of an acre down to just slightly under half an acre in the size of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=258)|
| 0:04:32| What I was hoping to do was to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| Currently, the property is split into two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| I was going to reshape them so that I was able to build two houses per the zoning allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=281)|
| 0:04:51| Is this lot part of the Denwood subdivision or Woodfield, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| Is it part of the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| No, sir. Not to my understanding, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| It just touches to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| But your entrance is coming from the Denwood field, I'm sorry, subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| It would. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| I've got a few phone calls about this from the elderly people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| This is a 1950s, 60s subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Hopefully, some of the commissioners got to go out and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| These are lodge lots, housings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| They're now residential housings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| I'm for the sector plan change because our sector plan is outdated, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| But I'm not for more than splitting .750 into two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| You're going to probably end up having to have variances from the BZA on setbacks and things like that that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| Our BZA needs to understand that you cannot create your own variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| So if you decide that you wanted to build a bigger house on the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| and you have to go for variances on setbacks, that's not a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| That's what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Our BZA needs to realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| I will make the motion to approve the sector plan change because our sector plan is way, way out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| And I'll be glad when Advanced Knox, plug for Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| We've got meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Go to Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| But I'm not in favor of two dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| I'll tell you that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| On the first item there, I'll go to Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| I will turn it over to Mr. Schoonmaker to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| My head is so congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| Mr. Welch, I'm looking at the KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| And it looks like there's two parcels that have been combined together now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| but they're two separate parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| One's kind of a triangular shape at the southern portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| and then the northern portion is a perfect square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| So is he asking for two parcels on the one parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:35| He's requesting rezoning for both of those parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| He owns both of those parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| So when you're saying the street address is zero, you're including both parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| I'll speak to the rest of it in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| I'll make a motion that ‑‑ let me jump to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| I apologize, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| Make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| low district residential, because it is compatible with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Motion to approve the sector plan amendment to LDR by Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| This is 7‑F‑22‑RZ, request of Costello Homes, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| for rezoning from CAK, general business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| to RA low density residential property located at 0 Carla Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| property ID 137DA010 and 13722502 in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=536)|
| 0:09:08| Chair, will you please restate your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| My name is Frankie Ramos, address 1581 Pine Ridge Road, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Again, I apologize for all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| If you went out there and if you'll look on your packet here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| you'll see that all the surrounding area are large lot of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| There's not any homes that are not more than, I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| at least three quarters of acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Some of them are more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| This is not two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Dividing this 0.750 into two homes is not reasonable, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| It will be a deterrent to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| So I will be making a motion to approve low density residential zoning at one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| It's what I will be recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| That was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| Mr. Moyers, did I do something wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Well, I don't think LDR is actually a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| RA is what the Planning Commission has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| You could do RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| You could do PR at one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| And, Commissioner Daley, can we hear from Jeff Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Yeah, I was going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Can you explain the difference here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| I mean, the RA zoning would allow, you know, with sewer up to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| a lot size of 10,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Without sewer, 20,000 square foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| But under RA density, so that is the density that he could try to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| under the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| So if you wanted to limit the density, it would have to be part of your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| with that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Plan residential is where we typically see limiting our density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| for the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| And, Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| would you please give us Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Oh, Planning Commission recommended approve the RA low density zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| because it's consistent with surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Okay, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| So if we go with RA and I make the motion that one per acre on RA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| is limited to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| If that is your motion, I think that would be what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| you'd have to verify with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| but that would be your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| On RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Did you hear that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I was answering a question the Commissioner was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Just for clarification, since it's RA, I said LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Since it's RA, if I make a motion for RA at one dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| will that one dwelling unit is all he will be able to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Well, normally, Mr. Welch, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| the densities are set forth in the zoning regs themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| We don't do density statements on RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| RA is self-contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Planned residential is generally where we set the density requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| So I don't know that I've seen somebody, a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| set a density ceiling on RA because RA basically sets it itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| As I think Mr. Welch was saying, if you have sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| the minimum lot size is 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| If you don't, it's, what, 20, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Also, is this one lot or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Because we're talking about .75, but what it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| what Commissioner Schoonmaker is showing me is what looks like two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| Is he resubdividing these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| I assume that he's going to come in and resubdivide that into two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| combine them into larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Well, I mean, is the total .75?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| If you put the two lots together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Okay, if the triangular lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| do we know what approximately the square footage of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Do we know whether it's served by sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| Because the concern I'm having over here is if it's two different lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| it could be you could put a home on each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| There's both sewer and water served to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Okay, so you need 10,000 for each of them in order to get two lots on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| or two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| I would make the assumption that if he gets a rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| he would come in and then subdivide it into two larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| I don't know if that's his intent or not, but that's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I guess I'm getting confused because what he's asking for is .75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Is there another lot that he owns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| What is the size on the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Yeah, we were just looking at the, Jim was looking at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Combined, the two lots are approximately .75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| Okay, if you combine the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| Mr. Moyers is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| I don't think we've seen where we've applied a density to an RA zone before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| It's pretty much self-contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| So my only choice would make a recommendation for denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| or could I go for a recommendation to PR, which he has to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| We could do it under PR, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| He would have to come back through planning commission with planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Was planned residential zone discussed at that time, at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| I mean, he applied for RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| We typically do not like to apply planned residential zones to lots smaller than one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| because of the setback restrictions in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and it just makes it a little bit more challenging to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| and RA is very consistent with the rest of the development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| I'll yield the floor to someone else while I think this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Mr. Welch, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Under 5.11.09A, not more than one dwelling unit is permitted on any lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=923)|
| 0:15:33| except as under 5.1103, which is use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Is that your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| From my understanding, Mike, the one dwelling unit is allowed as used by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| and a duplex or two dwellings would be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| So if you just rezoned at RA, he would have the right to build one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| If he wanted to build a second, I think he'd have to get a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| That would go back through planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| That would be appealable to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| So you'd have that protection if you wanted to keep it at RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=963)|
| 0:16:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Mr. Snowden, does Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| looking at the driveway access through the rear of the property to connect with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| Michael's Lane, or because of the smaller triangular shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| is his driveway going to be on Carla Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| It was my understanding that the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| because I believe he does have at least a minimum of 25 feet of road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| along Carla Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| that it was the applicant's desire to connect to Carla Drive rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| narrow easement along Michael's Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| But you're classifying these as one lot and not as two separate lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| Well, I mean, it's two lots right now, two parcels right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| So if it gets rezoned RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| then he would need to come back and with whatever his plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| if he wants to do one dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| he wouldn't have to come back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| But if he wants two or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| he would have to come back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Seeing no more lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Just confirm, Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| I make the motion for RA, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| He can only build one unless he comes back to planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| submits a use on review to split the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and come back to review for two dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Commissioner Daly, I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| As long as we got the neighbors will know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| I will make sure all the neighbors know what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| And these are elderly neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| They don't really get out late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| That being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| I will make a motion, item 62, for RA, low density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1096)|
| 0:18:26| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| Commissioner Daly made a motion to approve the RA residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1133)|

| 0:19:05| 7-E-22-SP is a request of Randy Gennard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1145)|

| 0:19:18| and HP Hillside Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Property located at 7600 Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Parcel ID 021-159.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1164)|

| 0:19:38| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| I'm not opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1181)|
| 0:19:51| Ms. Nadine Porter reminded me that she has signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| So, Mr. Welch, will you please give us Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| Planning Commission recommends approval of the Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| to Rural Residential and Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| because it is consistent with the development in the area by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Ms. Porter, I will allow Mr. Gennard to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| and then you will have your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Mr. Gennard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| I'd like to ask to approve as it was approved with the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| 30 units total on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| We've answered some of the questions that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| We've met with residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Can you speak into the mic? It's hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| We met with the neighbors in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| and there was a concern about the old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| There's a 1910 house on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| and we're going to keep that house and renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| I've spoken with Gibbs Planning advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| There was a question on the sewer also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| The sewer is down on Fairview Road, and the sewer will be by the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| not by any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| If any of the neighbors do want to hook up to it, they will be charged then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| but there will not be a charge beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| We're going to add four craftsman-style houses on Ridgeview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| and the rest of it will be 25 additional lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| We want to make a pocket neighborhood out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| I don't think there's many other pocket neighborhoods, if any, in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| I've gone to Nashville and looked at a couple of them in Asheville, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| and we'd like to do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| Stormwater detention will be under power lines down on the panhandle of this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| along with walking trails and community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| We're going to leave the green space in the center where the pocket neighborhood is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and there will be a couple of provisions for food truck parking for neighborhood get-togethers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| or whatever is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Ms. Porter, will you please approach the podium, give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| And you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Nadine Porter, 7421 Openview Lane, Corrington, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| I'm here speaking on behalf of Gibbs Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| and I want to say this is a rare occasion I'm not here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| I reached out to Mr. Gennard before this went, before Planning Commission, and he called me immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| He was very excited to tell us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| He offered a concept plan, which is rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| I want to say we're supportive of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| and the reasoning being that communication between us and him and the community was key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| That doesn't ever happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| And we're very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| We were impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| He was proactive in reaching out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Some talking points I just wanted to make sure I went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| When you're rezoning agricultural land, that's a scary topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Most of the time it's hundreds of acres that are bulldozed to put up houses that you puzzle piece in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| that don't bring any value to the community other than four walls and a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| This one brings a lot to the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| We don't have anything in Gibbs like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| I guess the major concern was the Sharp House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| It's not on the historical register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| but it's really significant to the hundreds of people that have expressed concern over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| He's going to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| He offered to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| We didn't ask him of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| He already planned to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| That doesn't happen, and we were impressed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| He's going to do a gathering space, community garden, a potential dog park if they can fit that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| walking trails, just it's more community oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| We don't see that often, and so we always get asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| can you give us an example of a good development, something we can model around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| We finally have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| We can say at this meeting, new commission, we can start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| We have a good development finally, and we can use this as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| Let's see, sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Seasoning is always consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Eventually, probably in the near future within the next year, that is always going to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| because every time you say a sector plan is consistent with surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| you branch out farther and farther and farther in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| and eventually you're not going to have anywhere else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| So a sector plan amendment needs to only be done when it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| and in this circumstance it finally makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Oh, community planning groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We have a stigma that we're against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| We're against growth with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| I don't speak for all of them, just gives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| What we are against is poor planning and irresponsible growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1486)|

| 0:27:06| It's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Having those communications outside of this formal arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I have seen it time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| We will accomplish more by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1632)|

| 0:27:25| because Nadine's done a great job of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| I was really pleased when I heard that Gibbs Planning Advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| was supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| I was not surprised because, as Nadine said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| they're not against development, but they're for the right kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And I've been begging for this kind of development in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| You know, we had a sector plan amendment before us a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| that I very strongly opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| It passed, but I felt like it was going the wrong direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| away from the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And, you know, it was not that same kind of development as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| And I appreciate Mr. Gennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1681)|

| 0:28:09| So I want to offer a motion to approve this sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=1689)|

| 0:35:08| and I can imagine that those residents are very concerned about the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| that this development will bring with 72 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=2112)|

| 0:35:18| If there were no neighbors there and we were building on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| we would have to improve it for our own residents, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| to make it safe and passable for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=2124)|

| 0:50:14| Hi there, Mr. Mormon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Could you just give us an idea of what you plan to do with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| There are two homes located on it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Will those stay, or do you have a vision for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| One of them, if you've seen, is a very nice home, and the gentleman that owns the property built it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| He bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| He doesn't desire to maintain that much property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| The other home that you mentioned is in disrepair, not in very good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| He plans to demolish that home and build three or four more homes comparable to the one he's built already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3049)|

| 0:50:52| That kind of answered my question, but have we kind of settled on two or three houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| It will be whatever the property will support and the Planning Commission will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| He will have to further subdivide the property to do what he's wanting to do, and it will be whatever it will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I think when you and I spoke, Thompson Road is a pretty tiny road, but it is at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| I mean, his property is at the beginning, so I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3079)|

| 0:51:29| and I would say that I personally avoid Thompson Road unless I'm just right in that close area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3089)|

| 0:53:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Mr. Mullins, would you like to speak to this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| It's hard to divorce the Sector Plan and the zoning from one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| They're kind of part and parcel of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| So if you can maybe let me have the time for both of them on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| and can go into the history of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| and why this appeal is appropriate, if that would be okay, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for Mr. and Mrs. Turner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| who own the Knoxville Martial Arts Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| It's been an interesting journey to get here, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| They have been a longtime owner of a property in Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| where they ran their martial arts business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| They've touched countless numbers of lives through that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| If anyone here is in support of this application, would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| You can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| I used to be in front of a board where most of the people standing behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| are actually in favor of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| So forgive me if I'm a little discombobulated for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| They outgrew their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| They needed to update the old Pease Furniture space that they were leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| So they looked to buy property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| and they wanted to buy property still in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| because they were invested in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| and wanted to continue to invest in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| and stay close to where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| So they thought they bought five tracts of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| If you look at the map that's in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| they bought three residential tracts zoned RA north of Old Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| They thought they bought a small 0.5 acre of property zoned CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| which is there north of Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| contiguous to this property they're trying to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And they thought they bought the larger 5-plus acre tract of CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| that's south of Old Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| They paid the price for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| They closed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| It turns out they didn't buy the two properties that were commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| The seller had already sold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| The only reason they bought the residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| is because the seller wouldn't sell them the commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| unless they also bought the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| So they were left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| They'd already sold the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| They are leasing back the property for a short-term basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| the Pease property where they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| so they can continue their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| They started site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| They bought a metal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| The metal building's delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| It's sitting on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| They're trying to keep people from walking off with bits and parcels of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| So they sought the rezoning to CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| because it looked to them that it was contiguous to existing CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| They're only seeking to rezone a small portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| They picked the section of this property that would make the most sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| given the topography, to create their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| They're wanting to not only have their martial arts academy relocate there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| they're also wanting to bring a world-renowned dog groomer in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| It's also going to use part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| So they need a large enough building space to accommodate a large enough building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| which is why they've asked for only the parts that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| They've reached out to the neighbor, the Flanagans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| They don't have any opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| They're maintaining a buffered zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| You know, I disagree with planning staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| If this isn't inconsistent with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| there's lots of commercial properties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| They thought they bought two pieces of commercial property that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| But for that mistake, we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| But now the clock's ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Their lease is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| They've got to do something with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| After the rezoning, I wasn't involved in this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| until the Tuesday before the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| After the rezoning, we talked to county codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| We talked to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| We talked to Chancellor Moyers about the transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| We talked to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| The transition zone will work for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| But as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| because the planning commission didn't consider the transition zone previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| that would have to go back to the planning commission before that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| We're willing to zone this transition, but we need to get the commercial zoning now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| so we can move forward with taking care of our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| keeping people from stealing the metal, build it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| and then the potential negative effects that the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| and planning commission were concerned about, about general commercial, can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| We can go back and change it to transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| which will then restrict the use to what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| I know it's an unorthodox way of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| but this is an unorthodox set of circumstances here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| and where we've gotten to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| If it weren't for the clock ticking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| we would already be with a zoning application back for the transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| But we wanted to move forward with our appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| ask for CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| It is consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| There's property right there that is zoned CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| It's either not suitable for our purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| or we've tried to buy it and couldn't or didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| So what we're doing is just trying to make a reasonable accommodation for this use to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| for this family that has invested for years into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| to continue to be located in this community and give back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| So I would ask that you approve the sector plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| We will file, if we get this zoning, we will file for a transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| but that will at least allow us to not be delayed in moving forward with our plans now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| because that's really pressing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| And I don't know if Mr. and Mrs. Turner want to say anything to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| They're much more articulate about these issues than I am, so please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:49| Mr. Turner, just a few minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| My name is Eric Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| This is my wife, Taylor Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| We both live at 360 Teresa Ann Drive, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Mr. Mullins laid it out perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| We want to be in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| We want to be in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| We thought we had purchased commercial land to be in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Come to find out, we had the rug pulled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| our wool pulled over our eyes and the rug pulled out from underneath us, so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And, you know, we asked for five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| We know a lot of that acreage isn't usable because it's got sinkholes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| It's got other layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| So we're really only asking for a very small portion of our land to be zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| That's where we want to put our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| That's where we want to put our parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| You know, at the zoning commission meeting where we first met, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| well, there's other commercial land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| If it is, it's not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| So maybe there's a lot of commercial land around us, but no one's selling it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| And the one place that is for sale, there's a 3,000-square-foot building that's for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| That won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Right now we're using about 12,000 square feet and we're asking for a 20,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| There's a six-acre lot that's available for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| That's a little bit outside of our price budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| So between a 3,000-square-foot building and a 45,000-square-foot manufacturing building, there's nothing for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| This is what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| We want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| We've went to Mr. and Mrs. Flanagan's house three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| We've met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| We've been active on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| We've reached out to anybody that will want to talk to us about our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| We're very proactive of being good community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| We've been in business since 1999, and in all of that time, we've always been good community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| We have a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| We reach out to people that are disadvantaged, that can't afford martial arts lessons, or are disproportionately affected by domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| So the LGBTQ plus community, women, we reach out to those people as part of our nonprofit to make sure they have a place that has turned people's lives around, that has made their life better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3687)|
| 1:01:37| All we're asking is for the chance to do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| We've invested a lot already into Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| It's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| It's changing because we invested a lot of money to make it change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| So, yeah, it's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| So we just want the opportunity to continue to do what we've been doing for the last 23 years, just do it here and do it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| My love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| My name is Taylor Turner, 360 Theresa Ann Drive, Seymour, Tennessee, 37865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| Everything's pretty much been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| The only thing I'd like to add is there's a lot of empty buildings that are on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| We really want a forever home, and that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| We currently are in the Peace Furniture Store building, thought that we could renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| We're not developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| We got in there and realized that renovating buildings is a lot more than just putting on some fresh paint and taking down some shag carpeting on the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| And so we tried for years to be able to redo that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| It got outside of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| We're in a position now that we can do something really nice and grow the community, and we really love that opportunity to stay where we are and have all of our people have a future home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Commissioner Ward, I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I actually know the property in the area very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I used to own property about 200 yards south of where this location is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| Where is the access to the property coming off of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Is it Maryville Pike, or is it going to be on Yonge Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| It'll come off of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| And there's a small portion of it that's actually owned by Knox County called the Maryville Pike Terminus, which used to be the old Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| That will be the access to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| Okay, I know exactly where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Otherwise, whatever Commissioner Daley thinks I'm for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I had the opportunity to speak to Ms. Turner, and we had a wonderful conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| I love what you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| I think you're a huge asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| But I love that you give so much back to the community in your business and the area you want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| I just always love to kind of give you the warm and fuzzies, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| But I just want to applaud you and also definitely want to lend my support to Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| whatever route that he wants to go, because I think that you guys have already been through enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| And I think that we can fix that problem up here on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| So I'm happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Commissioner Daley, I saw you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Madam Chair, I'll go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| If this gets approved, will the structure go on 1461 address, just the 5.75 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3856)|
| 1:04:27| I'm not sure exactly what address it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| I think the address we have it closest to is 1501 Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| But it's three residential areas that we're making into one zone that is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| Okay, yeah, the 1501 is next to the Flanagan's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Well, yes, sir, that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| And speaking of Mr. and Mrs. Flanagan, they were all right with that plan as long as we go back and zone it transitional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| which is absolutely our plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| And then originally you thought you had the Pleasant property on the north side of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| You thought that was included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Yes, sir, we really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| And they don't want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| No, sir, Mr. Pleasant is not interested in selling us that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-zoning?start=3909)|
