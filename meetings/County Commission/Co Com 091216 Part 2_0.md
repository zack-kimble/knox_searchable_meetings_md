| 0:00:00| West Hampton Subdivision. I've lived there for about six months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| And I'm not really bothered by the train whistles that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| It's not anything that I would like to get up and really protest about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:14| But I do have a Master's in Public Health in Concentration Industrial Hygiene and Public Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=14)|
| 0:00:20| And the thought of having these unattended, unregulated crossings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:27| on this heavily trafficked road when there are options out there to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:33| and it's just a question of money and resources is kind of troubling to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| because this is a very heavily trafficked road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| It's heavy residential. There are school buses on it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| And Westland itself, this part of Westland, is two-lane, very windy, no lights, no shoulder, no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=47)|
| 0:00:56| And the railroad track is right there, right next to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| And coming home, there's been three wrecks that have totally blocked off this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| And we've had to go all the way around with very serious injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| because you can't see when you come out of some of these subdivision crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| And what I would like is to have some kind of plan to improve this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| We're trying to move to a more friendly community area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| where everybody works together and walks to places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| And there's no way to get out and walk on this area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| You take your life in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| You can't even bicycle down this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| But I would like to see the first step is to look at these railroad crossings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| and see if we could get some sort of plan on how to get them signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| with the crossings and with the gates and with the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| and then move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| And I don't think it's just a nuisance and it's something we've got to get used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| I think that the traffic is such that we need to plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=126)|

| 0:02:27| contractor and contractor storage yards, create standards for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| and assign as permitted uses and uses on review in various zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=157)|

| 0:02:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| I have one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| We're going to have to have two public forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| We're getting into the holiday season, so I'm sure it's not a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| And that's on Dr. Briggs' amendment, I meant a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| Do you have some suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Maybe we can have one during the daytime, one in the evening, maybe after agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Chairman, I say you set them up and those of us that can make them can make them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| because if you try to please all 19 of us, you're going to have a hard time doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| So my suggestion is for you to get those set up sometime right after the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| If you'll check the basketball schedule, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| But check your form if you all still know how to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| The commission form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Well, I just wanted to mention the possibility of a little gathering following this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| but I think our time may be limited right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| So perhaps we'll just wish everybody a Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part2?start=256)|
