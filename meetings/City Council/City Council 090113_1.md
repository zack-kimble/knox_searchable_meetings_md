| 2:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| I didn't mean to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9809)|
| 2:43:30| There's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| Any further discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| We're going to move on to voting if I don't see something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| We'll do a roll call one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| Well, actually, maybe not one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| We're back to number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| We have two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| The first three failed, so this is back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| The first two passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| The third failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| So do you want to call this number four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| It would be easier for me to follow it if it is number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| This is actually number four with the first two passing, the third failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| A question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| We have left in the last vote the part dealing with a master signage plan where the size of the development is not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9852)|
| 2:44:26| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| And what is now being proposed as an amendment is saying they are allowed in 100 acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9869)|
| 2:44:42| As I understand it, this amendment would be a limitation on the amendment that says one EMC may be permitted as a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9882)|
| 2:44:52| within an area covered by a master signage plan to say that that sign must be 100 acres or larger and have a 400 square foot EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9892)|
| 2:45:04| So would that make moot the previous amendment that would allow master signage plans where no size of the development was discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9904)|
| 2:45:19| It would not make it moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9919)|
| 2:45:20| It would simply limit it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| It would further limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| It would say it's a bare minimum of 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| To even consider EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| I think that's what's intended by the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| I'm just trying to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| That's what's intended, and I hope that that addresses your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| or your desire to buy the lot next door to your house and put one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| I think that cuts you out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| Just so we'll get the numbers right, this is number five, two of which have passed, two of which have failed, and this is number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9949)|
| 2:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9958)|
| 2:45:59| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| I'm sorry for the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9961)|
| 2:46:02| Me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Mr. Swanson, you are reading from the master signage plan amendment page, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| And I need two pieces of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| The page that I have in my packet talks about these 100-acre developments being allowed to have a 420-square-foot EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| but you have lowered that to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| And that was per Turkey Creek's request that they could live with 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| That's Mr. Brown's motion, for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| Does the way this language read to you indicate that if a 100-acre development wants an EMC of this type, that it has to be 400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9992)|
| 2:46:43| Or should it say up to 400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| Because right now it says, which shall be allowed to have a 400-square-foot EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| I am comfortable with up to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| Is up to 400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| I would accept it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| It might have been interpreted that way anyway, but that would certainly clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| I'll accept it with my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| I would like to, if that friendly amendment works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| It was accepted by the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| Vice Mayor Brown said okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| Maryland said okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| Procedurally, Mr. Swanson, if I support the 100 acres but don't support the 400-square-feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| the options I would have would be to, can I amend the, it's an amendment so I can't amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10043)|
| 2:47:28| It would be to vote for it and then amend the 400-foot down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10048)|
| 2:47:35| Yes, I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| If this passes, that may be an exercise in futility, but you can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10057)|
| 2:47:43| That would be the next numbered amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10063)|
| 2:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10067)|
| 2:47:48| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| Roll call one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10071)|
| 2:47:52| If this entire motion as amended fails, then where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10072)|
| 2:47:59| We're back at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| We're just on the amendment right now, but then if we get to the vote on it as amended, then we're nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10082)|
| 2:48:11| We're back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| We're back where Councilman Frost feared, that someone with, you know, a lot twice his size could come in and do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10094)|
| 2:48:21| could ask for a, be put up a measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| What she's saying, I think, if I'm understanding her correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| she's saying that if we pass amendment number five or even don't pass amendment number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| but then do not pass the ordinance as amended, then where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| And where we are is where we were when we came here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| I understand, and you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| And are we still under a moratorium for new EMCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10125)|
| 2:48:50| And Ms. Poplin, how long does that last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| It will last until March the 14th, and if you want to reconsider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| it will need to be on your March 10th agenda day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10139)|
| 2:49:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10140)|
| 2:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10141)|
| 2:49:02| We're ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10147)|
| 2:49:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10148)|
| 2:49:09| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10155)|
| 2:49:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10161)|
| 2:49:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10164)|
| 2:49:25| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10165)|
| 2:49:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10170)|
| 2:49:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10174)|
| 2:49:35| Now we're back to the motion as there's three amendments that have been accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10175)|
| 2:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| I have two simple questions for amendments that we might need or might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| One goes to, and, again, it's Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| just so we've got down on what we're thinking about, the right language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| In option A, right at the very beginning, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| intermittent flashing, running or blinking, blinking lights or animated illumination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| which is something we've agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| I don't see that clearly stated in the next two pages that I think we have adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10206)|
| 2:50:13| And my question is, do we need to add that line to what we've adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10213)|
| 2:50:20| And my sense is, to be safe, I'd like to do that just because I know that's what we've all agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| So I think unless you all tell me it's already in there someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| I'd like to amend what we've got to add a line that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| no sign shall have scrolling, intermittent, flashing, running or blinking lights or animated illumination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10233)|
| 2:50:43| And that would only apply, I guess, to the Turkey Creek sign because everything else is banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| No, it would agree to existing signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| Oh, existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10250)|
| 2:50:51| Existing signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| Because we have to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| And I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| I know that's what we want to do, but I want to make sure it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| So option D bans any new signs but requires the existing ones to meet the new operational standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10258)|
| 2:51:10| And I'm just asking this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| Do those new operational standards, as proposed in this ordinance under option D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10272)|
| 2:51:19| would they already include the limitation that he referred to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10284)|
| 2:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| So then that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| And I'm making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| Number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10292)|
| 2:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| And we'll give everybody a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10295)|
| 2:51:36| Where's the language on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10296)|
| 2:51:37| It's at number four on option A right at the very beginning, that first line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| Otherwise we'd be right back where we were previously before we passed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10302)|
| 2:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| Limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| Scrolling, intermittent, flashing, running, or blinking are animated illuminations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10312)|
| 2:51:58| None of that would be allowed for currently existing EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10318)|
| 2:52:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| And is the 60-second change already embodied in this language somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10330)|
| 2:52:18| changing no more frequently than 60 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| That's number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| Yeah, that's seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| It's in here, but it's not part of your amendment to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| Because D includes all of what's on pages two and three of A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| I would ask Ms. Poplin that, because that's not the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| Because D says we're requiring existing EMCs to meet amended operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10362)|
| 2:52:47| and locational characteristics, and there's nothing on that page that said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| So my assumption is that little box at the top is referring to all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| and that's a question I thought I asked a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| You want to make sure that you're adding E2 through 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10377)|
| 2:53:04| and for commercial districts and under industrial districts, 5B through 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10384)|
| 2:53:12| Those weren't in D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10392)|
| 2:53:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10393)|
| 2:53:14| Then why does D say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| and requiring existing EMCs to meet amended operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| and locational characteristics if there's not a single word in that proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| You've got to cover that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10409)|
| 2:53:30| Yeah, and that's why A was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| After this, everything's alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10415)|
| 2:53:36| We have the motion to add the one line now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10422)|
| 2:53:43| Where are we with the motion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| Well, did it get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| Yes, it got a second from Ms. Brito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Right now there's adding that one line at the beginning of A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| and I guess we have to go back and add all of A into D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10432)|
| 2:53:57| which I thought was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10437)|
| 2:53:58| and I thought I asked a question about this and was told it was in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| but you're talking about adding within option A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10441)|
| 2:54:08| number A that's in that box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| and it goes on for several pages and adds all of these regulations to existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10450)|
| 2:54:16| signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| But not all of it, because some of it we're not using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| What I read D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| and this is a question I actually asked before I even made an option to add D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| this actually says it's band new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| except for whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| while requiring existing EMCs to meet amended operational and locational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| That's the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| But that's only in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| And I said then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10482)|
| 2:54:43| this then includes what's already in A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| And I heard Mr. Donaldson say yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| so I assumed it was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| That's not what he just said, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| You need to make explicit that you're adopting those provisions of A that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| apply to commercial and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| That's the safe way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| Just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10507)|
| 2:55:08| Yes, that's the safe way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| We have a motion to add the language there on page one that is no sign of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10509)|
| 2:55:14| scrolling, intermittent, flashing, running, or blinking lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| or animated illumination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| We have a motion on that and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| And then we're going to need to do all of E and G from option A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10521)|
| 2:55:28| I guess, later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| Well, I think we need to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Mr. Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| Well, I'm not sure if we need all of E or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10534)|
| 2:55:39| but you're saying do that in a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| Yeah, well, because we have a separate amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Because you can change your amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| assuming your second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10551)|
| 2:55:52| I said you could add that into your existing amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| assuming that Councilman Pelow, who's your second, would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| I mean, you could add that other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| I guess we could, just to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| I'd actually do it because we don't need to add the rest of the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10564)|
| 2:56:08| that's on page one of A, because we've already dealt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| We need to add what's on pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| So I think it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| to do the amendment we've got that adds the one line from page one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| and then we need to add pages two, three, four, and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| I think in their entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| Can you delineate that by number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| So you're adding number four on option A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10593)|
| 2:56:38| No, we're adding the first line of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| No sign shall have scrolling, intermittent, flashing, running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| or blinking lights, or animated illumination, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10607)|
| 2:56:48| Okay, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| That's it for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| And then what we're going to do is we're going to add later by motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| pages two, three, four, and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| So right now your amendment just covers that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| We're ready to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| We're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| I'm going to go with voice vote on this, unless it's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10624)|
| 2:57:09| So we'll try first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10631)|
| 2:57:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10632)|
| 2:57:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10633)|
| 2:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10634)|
| 2:57:15| Now, do you want somebody else to make this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| No, let's keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| I'd like to add pages two, three, four, and five of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| And let me just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| Of exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| Of exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| And let me just ask Mr. Donaldson, where it says insert drawings here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| do we have to amend something to actually insert the drawings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| No, there are drawings that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| Or someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| Yeah, they're brought into the code already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| But you will want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| Some of these apply to new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10668)|
| 2:57:52| Well, the drawings are related to a clarification of old language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10672)|
| 2:58:00| And this is actually also the language that says every EMC existing on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10680)|
| 2:58:12| date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| Lean forward there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10694)|
| 2:58:15| So we got to add this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10695)|
| 2:58:18| And just given how confusing this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| and I don't know if I'm helping with this and I'm a little frustrated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10701)|
| 2:58:25| what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| But, again, for second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| I want to ask somebody to actually write up everything we've got on one piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| of paper so we can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| I nominate Sandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| I think this will be a very helpful second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10719)|
| 2:58:44| Of those provisions from pages two, three, four, and five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10724)|

| 2:58:57| Bingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| Bingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| Because that goes back and permits EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| Capital letter G5A, because you've already created alternative language for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10742)|
| 2:59:11| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| Okay, I'll agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| Okay, we've got some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| That was where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Mr. Holquist, anything different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| You lost me on G5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| Okay, no, wait, I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10765)|
| 2:59:26| Industrial companion to the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10769)|
| 2:59:30| Again, is that just number one of that G5A or is it all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10770)|
| 2:59:37| A under G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| While he's searching, is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| Okay, Ms. Pelo did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10783)|
| 2:59:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10784)|
| 2:59:45| Okay, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| I'm going to go to voice vote again this time unless somebody, unless it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| Hypo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| In number 12, it says every line of text in an EMC shall not exceed the following standards, designated road speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10799)|
| 3:00:06| and it says maximum text size in inches, and that should actually say minimum text size in inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10806)|
| 3:00:12| So I'd like to amend that word maximum there and over in the G section to say minimum as opposed to maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10812)|
| 3:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10823)|
| 3:00:24| Okay, second by Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10824)|
| 3:00:26| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| What was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| Minimum text size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| Yes, the idea is the letters have to be at least this big as opposed to not bigger than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10831)|
| 3:00:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| Because that goes back to the work that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10843)|
| 3:00:44| Any further questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10846)|
| 3:00:47| All those in favor of that amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| Number, I think that's number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| Mr. Becker, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| Let's have one more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| I was kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| No, well, this one, again, this is the Mr. Brown's amendment that added the 400 square foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10869)|
| 3:01:17| in the 100 acre master sign plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| Maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10880)|
| 3:01:21| Maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| Or up to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| I'd like to make an amendment to change that to up to 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10884)|
| 3:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10890)|
| 3:01:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10891)|
| 3:01:32| Do you have it one more time, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| I was getting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10895)|
| 3:01:38| And Mr. Brown's amendment, which I believe is in here someplace, except in development of 100 acres or larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10898)|
| 3:01:48| which shall be allowed to have a, right now it says 400 square foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| I want to change that to 100 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| I've got to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| Up to 100, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| The white space at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| It's right before the look on that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10929)|
| 3:02:10| I'm keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10931)|
| 3:02:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10932)|
| 3:02:13| We'll change that from 100 acres to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| No, keep it at 100 acres and go from 400 square feet to 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10940)|
| 3:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10946)|
| 3:02:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10947)|
| 3:02:28| Did anybody second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10948)|
| 3:02:29| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10950)|
| 3:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| Well, there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10952)|
| 3:02:33| Now there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| Discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Mr. Hopus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10957)|
| 3:02:38| Again, I think it's been said several times, if we go with 400 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10958)|
| 3:02:43| it's pushing us up into the realm of off-premise billboards and digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| I think this is one way of staying out of that, off that slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10969)|
| 3:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10977)|
| 3:02:58| A rate of vote, then, on this last amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| Are you sure this is the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| It's the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10983)|
| 3:03:04| I don't like that, no leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10986)|

| 3:03:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| Better do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=10992)|

| 3:03:27| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11007)|
| 3:03:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11009)|
| 3:03:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11010)|
| 3:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11011)|
| 3:03:32| I heard five ayes and four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11012)|

| 3:03:36| So that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11018)|
| 3:03:39| Now we're back to the motion as incredibly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11019)|
| 3:03:47| This obviously will be a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11027)|
| 3:03:49| I think Mr. Becker's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11029)|
| 3:03:50| When we get it in second reading, I think people will have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| Surely there's another amendment out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| We've got second reading yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11036)|

| 3:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11056)|
| 3:04:17| Bailey and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11057)|
| 3:04:18| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11058)|
| 3:04:19| This first reading, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11059)|
| 3:04:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| I'm moving on to second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11062)|
| 3:04:23| So I heard Bailey, Pelo, and Hall as noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| The other six as yeses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| What about we do this on an emergency basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11067)|
| 3:04:30| We've got to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| Then we'd get Becker back in the fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11074)|
| 3:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=11075)|
