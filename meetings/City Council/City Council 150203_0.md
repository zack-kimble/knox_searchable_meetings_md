| 0:01:57| For the mayor's report, first, just a quick reminder that we will have our annual budget retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| with the administration of the city council this Friday, February 6th, from 9 a.m. to about 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| at the convention center. We'll be in room 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| And as usual, Jim York, our finance director, will provide a midyear update on our current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| and we'll also hear from Christy and Bill and others about some of the accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| and major projects of the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| It's always a good opportunity for good discussion and a good midyear review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| So we look forward to seeing you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| And anybody else who wants to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| I know folks are paying attention to the current debate in Nashville over Governor Haslam's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Insure Tennessee proposal. And, you know, I personally support the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| and we've let our local legislators know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| We have been working with folks in this community to make sure that those who are eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| for the Affordable Care Act know that they are eligible and, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| and that there's an annual deadline, which is fast approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| It's February 15th is the cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| So to help anyone seeking to enroll under the ACA, the city has partnered with several organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| once again this year, to sponsor a free enrollment event this Saturday, February 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Magnolia Avenue campus of Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| There will be trained navigators on hand to walk people through every stage of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| and enrollment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| So for more information, including what kinds of personal documents you need to bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| you can call the city's 3-1-1 service or our call center, call 3-1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| or visit our website at cityofknoxville.org slash affordablecareact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| We want to thank the Knoxville Area Project Access, Cherokee Health System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| and the Tennessee Health Care Campaign for helping to organize and staff this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Last year we had more than 100 people come to a similar enrollment event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| And, by the way, there are multiple enrollment events going on throughout our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| so this isn't the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| But as a result of that, there were a lot of people that were able to review what their options were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| and sign up for coverage if they thought that was the best thing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| And I also want to give you an update on a project our Office of Sustainability has been working on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| You all probably remember that we had a public meeting last summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| to talk about possible changes to the zoning code to encourage more urban agriculture in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| This would cover both community gardens and market gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| where people can sell what they grow in their own backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| So after collecting public input and reviewing our current zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| and looking at other best practices around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| we've come up with a set of proposed changes that we have sent to NPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| We have also posted them on the city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| so anyone who's interested, you can go there to cityofknoxville.org slash sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| and you will find the proposed changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| There will be a lot of discussion at a future NPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| and then hopefully it will come to Council for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| So I encourage everyone who's interested in this topic of urban agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| to review the recommendations and let us know what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| You can contact our Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Brian, is there a link there for response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Brian, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| This is Brian Blackman, who is our staff at the Office of Sustainability along with Aaron Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| and he's really been leading this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| There's a link on the page that says send an email to sustainabilityatcityofknoxville.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| If they have any comments after reviewing that or they just want some general information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| feel free to send that email and we'll respond to them as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Thank you, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| So working with Brian, a lot of partners have been involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| including our Law Department, Plans Review, Public Service, Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| NPC, Knox County Health Department, and UT Extension Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| So particularly thanks to Brian for pulling this all together and shepherding it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| He kind of inherited this when he came to us last summer because it had already started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| and he had to step in and keep it going, so we appreciate the hard work he's put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| So please look at those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| They are draft at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Please look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Call Brian if you have questions or email and give us your comment back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Finally, there is another important event coming up in about a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and that is the Neighborhood Conference on Saturday, March 7th, at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| You all know what a great event it was the last time we held it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Lots of people were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| It is free and online registration is now open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| And I want to ask our Office of Neighborhoods Coordinator, David Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| to say a few more words about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| David Massey, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| This conference is really an exciting event for anyone interested in the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| of our residential neighborhoods in both Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| We opened this conference up to neighborhood groups and others in the county as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| It is a conference that is supported by a number of sponsors as well as the city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| We did have over 500 people at the conference in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| We're expecting at least that many or hoping for at least that many this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| because this year we have a strong youth component to the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| We've got five workshops devoted to youth or schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| And we have quite a few others including, as all of you here know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| a workshop for members of city council to meet and greet folks from the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| Registration is now open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Anyone can go to thecityofknoxville.org forward slash neighborhoods to get that link to register online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| If anyone does not have access to the Internet or a computer, they can call 215-2113,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=484)|
| 0:08:13| and we will send a hard copy of our brochure with all of the workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and with a hard copy of the registration form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| We really urge everybody to take a look at the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| There are over 55 now information booths signed up for the conference, 32 workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| neighborhood T-shirt contest, door prizes at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| So it's going to be a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Thanks so much, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Okay, that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Are there reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| I always look to your vice mayor first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| No, I was just looking at Mr. Swanson's expression when he pointed at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| First, I'd like to just mention a few things in the second district that have happened recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| and one is the Little Bearden Pocket Park across from Mayo's there on the corner that the city has acquired that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=546)|
| 0:09:15| and I want to give a special thanks to Casey Krause and David Brace for the landscaping that's been done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| We hope to have later in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| We'll go ahead and do the sod for that area, but it's really spruced up that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| and we want to thank them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I also want to thank the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| The Third Creek bike trail behind West High School has been corrected with the flooding there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| and, again, the city took the initiative to fix that themselves, and that has really been an improvement for the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| And then the other thing which both Mayor Brown and I share is the new sidewalk on Sutherland Avenue across from the UT fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=585)|
| 0:09:55| and if any of you get a chance, go down there and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| One of the main concerns that we had in that particular area were a number of people in the wheelchairs that had to go out onto the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| and so now they can get from all the way down to Jade Street in front of the different restaurants there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| So I want to thank the city for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| The other thing that I'd like to bring up has nothing to do with the second district, but it does have to do with the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| It appears that we will be asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| On February 17th, you're grinning, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Control yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| She's not the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| I was reacting to all the other faces I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| But we've run into a couple of procedural items that we need to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and we need to make sure that those are correct when council does review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| So we will be postponing that to a later date, and I will let you know on the 17th when it will be postponed, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you, and thanks to all those projects in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| We appreciate working with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| You represent your district well, and these are some really exciting projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| so thanks for how well you've worked with our staff on all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=671)|

| 0:11:15| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| So now we're on elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=678)|

| 0:12:05| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=726)|

| 0:12:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=758)|

| 0:12:41| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| 10A is an ordinance approving the request of Quint Bourgeois for an amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| North City Sector Plan from low-density residential to medium-density residential for property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| located on the west side of Bruin Road, north of Dutch Valley Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| on appeal from a decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I would like, I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| My son works with Mr. Bourgeois, and I will recuse myself and not comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Councilman Saunders will recuse himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| I was just going to say, I think we've got a few people signed up to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| I was going to let us hear from both sides first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| So let me just explain what will happen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| An appeals process we have, it's a little different process than our general comments on a resolution or an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| So first we will hear from the appellant, the person who filed the appeal, and that person's representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| And then we hear those who may be here responding or opposing that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| And each side gets up to three speakers for up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| And then after, so we have the appellant, and then we have the respondents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| and then the appellant is allowed to then have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| One speaker can have up to two minutes as a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| And so that's how we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| So I'm going to call, we start first for those who signed up in favor of the appeal, supporting the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| And the three names are Jim Tipton, Quint Bourgeois, and Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| So if you'd like to come up and please again state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| and I'll start our timer and I'll let you know when you're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| And we appreciate each of you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Are you Mr. Tipton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Jim Tipton at 7227 Sunset Ridge Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| The property is 4.73 acres running Bruin Road adjacent to an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| across Bruin from the Enskip Pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| one lot removed from commercial zoning within 500 feet of the Bruin-Dutch Valley intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| The owner is Cajun Investment Partnership, whose principal partner is Quint Bourgeois,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| who bought the property in 2003 specifically due to its R2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| By ordinance passed by council on December 19, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| the zoning for the Enskip area was changed from medium-density residential to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| and this property was rezoned R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| The ordinance itself exempted six properties shown on the MPC recommendation map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| which were grandfathered as R2 at the request of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| Immediately after passage of the downzoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| council, by separate motion and amendment, amended the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| to exempt an additional 24 properties, allowing those owners to retain R2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| Every property owner who asked MPC or city council to allow them to retain R2 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| a total of 30, were allowed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Mr. Bourgeois would have done so had he known about the downzoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| The MPC and council minutes make clear that he would have also been allowed to retain R2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| due to his, quote, investment-based expectations, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| On October 29, 2013, MPC mailed a letter to Enskip property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| notifying them of the proposed downzoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Mr. Bourgeois did not receive his notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| There's no basis to doubt his word about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Had he received it, he would have acted as he did act as soon as he found out about the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| Mr. Bourgeois is not here to challenge the city's action in the downzoning in the Enskip area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| His request is for council to exempt his property from the downzoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| based on a due process or equal protection under law argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| He is asking council to consider whether it would be unfair or unjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| for council to refuse to grandfather his R2 zoning when, but for the lack of notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| the property would already be downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I'm sorry, grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| If you feel that it is only fair under the concepts of due process and equal protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| to give Mr. Bourgeois the relief he seeks, the next question is how you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| Some questions have been raised about whether you can restore the R2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| without amending the one-year plan or the North City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I believe that it's clear that you have the power and authority to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| because the council did precisely that for 24 property owners on December 19, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| The minutes of that meeting make very clear that the downzoning ordinance had passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| and was effective immediately as an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| After its passage, there was a subsequent motion, seconded by different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| which also passed to, quote, amend the ordinance to exclude from the rezoning 24 properties zoned MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| The ordinance had already passed and already existed, or else it could not have been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| Upon such passage, R2 zoning was no longer consistent with the one-year plan or the North City Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| Yet, nevertheless, council amended the ordinance to exclude or grandfather the 24 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| without amending those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And Mr. Bourgeois is simply asking you to do the same for his property, no more and no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| The fact that the amendment to exclude those 24 properties came within minutes after passing of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| and the fact that Mr. Bourgeois is here asking more than a year later for the same treatment is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| If council had the power on December 19, 2013 to exclude 24 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| without amending the one-year plan or the North City Sector Plan, it still retains that power today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| The issue of the suitability of the property for a particular use really should not be a factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| although it is suitable for R2 multifamily uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| The issue is, or should be, whether the owner is entitled under due process and equal protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| I'm sorry, sir, you have 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| to the same treatment as everyone who had notice of the downzoning and was allowed to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Sorry, I forgot to give you the one-minute warning, but you did perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Okay, so now we have Mr. Bourgeois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Let me get my timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| And please state your name and address again for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Quint Bourgeois, 8812 Tedford Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| I just come to you pleading, I guess, as a taxpaying citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| I bought this property almost 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| It was a substantial investment for me at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| I had to borrow the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| I paid $90,000 for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| To date, I've got another $80-something thousand into it, not counting my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| So I've just got over $200,000 in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I almost developed it at one time, and I've got the full engineering, everything ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| MPC had the addresses allotted for it and set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| I never dreamed or didn't realize the capability was there that I would lose my zoning at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Had I gotten the notice, I definitely would have opted out by e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| or come into the meeting as other people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| You know, when it comes to my attention, when I've got that kind of an investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| that all of a sudden, you know, the property, people I've talked to, appraisers and some other developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| it's probably made the property worth half of what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| As a matter of fact, I'm upside down in it now, money-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| because I've got less in it now than it would even bring after holding it for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| So I just would ask, after having such a substantial investment, that that would be given back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| I had a chance the other day to look back at when the whole process started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| and I think it initially passed by an eight to seven vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| And there was a lot of the NPC commissioners at the time that were real concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| As a matter of fact, one of them even spoke to the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| He said, gosh, I'm just afraid if we pass this, what's going to happen in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| if there's somebody there that doesn't know about it that all of a sudden comes out and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| hey, I didn't know this happened, and lo and behold, I fit that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| So the property itself is very conducive also, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| If it were in the center of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I would still think I would deserve to not have lost my zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| just as other people who were in the center of the neighborhood didn't lose their zoning when they opted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| But mine's very near an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| It's four properties off a major intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| It's zoned one lot away from commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| I used to develop more in the past, and my understanding was always you want to see that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And when you go from commercial, you go more to multifamily, you go more to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| It falls in line with that, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So, anyway, I would just, if I'd gotten notice, I would have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| I didn't get the notice, and I would sure appreciate having my investment back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Mr. Jernigan, please state your name and address and get you started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Victor Jernigan, 10255 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| And I'm here to speak specifically to the actions of MPC and the actions of City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| as to the chilling effect that this kind of activity by a neighborhood on property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| which was correctly zoned for almost 15 years under the R2 zoning that Mr. Bourgeois zoned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| has on other opportunities inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| When the neighborhood, and the neighborhood spoke, and I watched it on the MPC as the meeting was continuing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| on live TV, the neighborhood spoke, they don't want any more of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| and that's a direct quote of several people who spoke at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| we don't want any more of those people in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I can say that it creates an extremely slippery slope for a neighborhood to be able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| who they're going to choose to be their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| The issue of density and the issue of being able to use this property under the R2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| has been clearly demonstrated with what's happened in West Hills on the 4.5 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| that was in front of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| It was originally to be 18 lots, and it was to be 14 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Four and a half months after not getting a site plan approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| the developer walked away from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| It winds up being a situation that if the City Council does not allow Mr. Bourgeois| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| to have the zoning that he certainly would have requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| he received a five-by-seven postcard, and he's going to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| How do you tell an investor that's coming to Knoxville from San Diego or from Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| or anywhere else that they're buying something as an investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| they're investing their retirement funds in the opportunity to develop property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| and a neighborhood can choose to change that zoning with no support from City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| So it basically says to the development community, don't invest in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| or if you do, invest as fast as possible, as quick as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| so you don't lose the rights that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| March 11th, 1944.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Do you have that newspaper article by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| I believe that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| There was a newspaper article that pointed out that the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1488)|
| 0:24:58| building permits in Skip Homes, permits given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| March 11th, 1944.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Building permits for the construction of the 137-house in Skip Homes subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| were issued yesterday by the County Planning Commission to Forest Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Mr. Vivian Incorporated, Mr. Vivian Birch, Commission Secretary, reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| The permits were issued in accordance with the present zoning restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Residence A or 50-foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| And I'll be finishing very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Citizens of the in Skip community called an emergency mass meeting to be held at the school at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| to oppose the construction of the homes, the 157 homes that are the core of the in Skip community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| Now, if you think about what is about to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Mr. Bourgeois has invested real capital and has the opportunity to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| And he would have certainly retained that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| except for a five-by-seven postcard that was mailed to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| I really, really strongly ask City Council to allow Mr. Bourgeois to keep the zoning that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| and so rightfully would have retained if he had known he should have acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Now we'll hear from the respondents, those who are opposed to this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Jennifer Mertz, Anita Case, and Renee Quinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| Jennifer, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Hi, I'm Jennifer Mertz, 606 Hines Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| My property is actually, would be directly affected by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| First of all, I'd like to say your decision last year to rezone properties to a lower density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| was wise and helpful for the greater community, and we truly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| I understand the role of rezoning is a plan to stabilize and keep our strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| I'm sorry, I'm getting over the flu, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| I understand the role of rezoning is a plan to stabilize our strong communities in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| and that's all that we have tried to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Mr. I can't say your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Bourgeois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Bourgeois did receive plenty of notification regarding the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| and now here it is almost a year and a half later, and now he wants to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| As a community, we have to stand to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| We may be small, but we have achieved greatness in our area, and we don't want that unraveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| We have worked diligently to stabilize our community and our foundation and our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| This is one of the reasons why we wanted the rezoning done, so we could stabilize our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Our community is filled with apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| It's filled with lots and lots of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Inskate Park and Pool is my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Literally, I look out my kitchen window, I don't see anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| In the last five years, I haven't even had to call the police for a drug deal going on anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| We have cleaned up this area, and that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| We have single families coming in and purchasing homes for the first time in a really long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| and we want to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Of course, MPC has already gone in front of them, and they said no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| and we would like your all's vote to say no also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| We take a lot of pride in our park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| We got a quarter of a million dollars donated by the Pilot Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| and we now have new playgrounds, new tennis courts, a miniature Frisbee golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| and it has been a great resource for families to get out and be with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| We work very closely with Healthy Kids Healthy Communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| and that's one reason why we allowed the dance studio to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| so our children have other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| We take a lot of pride in the way that it's cleaned up over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I've had numerous neighbors, and by the way, I'm going to have Ms. Betty Jo pass out two things for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| One was the whole list of the general rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and also we've had over 100 signatures from people that live in the Inskip community saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| please do not rezone this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| We do not want it to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Allowing a rezoning would just create a snowball effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| If we allow this gentleman to rezone his area, who else is going to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| and unravel what we've worked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| We did not come to a community and have this area rezoned for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| We did it for the greater good of the population, and our petition shows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1767)|
| 0:29:40| Because of your foresight, our efforts in building our community is seeing so much more pride in the Inskip area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| and that's the way we'd like to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I'm not speaking just for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| I'm speaking for every member in our community, and our petition shows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| That's what I got for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Thank you, Ms. Martz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Anita Case, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| My name is Anita Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I live at 1107 Henrietta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| I've lived there for over 30 years with my husband, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| I've raised two children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I'm an Inskip Neighborhood Association member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| I'm against the zoning change for the property across from Inskip Pool and Park, which is at 4204 Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| The zoning for this property should remain low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| I would like to point out to you once again, as I'm sure you already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Inskip is the second most populated community in Knoxville after the Fort Sanders community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| Inskip Elementary has the most mobile classrooms in Knox County due to overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| Bruin Road does not need more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| The children who live in the Northridge Crossing property cannot walk safely on Bruin Road to get to the Inskip Pool and Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| of which we're very proud, or to Inskip School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Also, we are very proud of our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| There are no sidewalks, and there's no shoulder to walk on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| We want to preserve the single-family home in Inskip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| We want quality over quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| The quality of our community is improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| I don't want to see that reversed with the addition of more apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| We want to improve the image of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| I want to live in a healthy, attractive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| This is the goal we are working toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Please don't allow our hard work, our efforts, to be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you, Ms. Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Now, Renee Quinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| My name is Renee Quinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I live at 4701 Upchurch Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| Pull the microphone towards you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| I could be too loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Upchurch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| If Mr. Bourgeois is allowed to circumvent the procedures and time limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| as the rest of us must follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| and he's allowed to develop his property as planned at this late date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1954)|
| 0:32:43| then it would be a game changer for the other residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| Only six, and then I think another 24, opted out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and they had timely submitted their request to opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| and were able to retain the zoning that they had at R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| If 80 more apartments are built on top of us again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| I have a 14-unit apartment on my residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| There is a 14-unit apartment, and it has changed our lives daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| And if 80 more apartments are in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| then Mr. Bourgeois is allowed to wait a year after not using due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| to check on his own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| It had nothing to do with a postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| I understand a postcard is not required, and the public notices were done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| so he was notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I feel if any of us had said that we weren't notified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| we would be told that the public notice was in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| and we are deemed to be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| As far as Mr. Tipton talking about equal protection and due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2050)|
| 0:34:19| Mr. Bourgeois has had all of the protections, due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| He had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| He made an investment into this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| He did not protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| Definitely the argument about equal protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| the residents of Inskip then would also want equal protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| We want equal protection for the council to respect the Inskip small area plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2089)|
| 0:35:01| that I'm sure costs money for the study to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and it was recommended that the R2 zoning be changed to R1 and R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| It was very important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| The population density is a real, real problem that we must deal with daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2117)|
| 0:35:35| If the plans are allowed to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| then I would want as far as equal protection for all of the other residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| to be able to open it back up, let them opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| The 80 apartments may be a death knell to the neighborhood that we were trying to save,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| and we may all want to opt out, take all the money we can take for our devalued property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| and go try to find other property elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Mr. Bourgeois, you have up to two minutes for rebuttal for yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| or another speaker that you choose if you choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2173)|
| 0:36:22| Two minutes each or just two minutes total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| No, just one person up to two minutes, right, for a rebuttal if you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| I'll make mine in 30 seconds, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Regarding the time, the second I found out, literally the next day, I called MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| and then the sector plan is only heard once a quarter when it deals with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| So I came to the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| So when an arbitrary mailing goes out that I didn't get, then the second I knew was as soon as I could know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| So I just the R2, I'm not the one who originally zoned the property R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| It was R2 when I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| So to me it's a little different than if I went and bought a piece of property and was trying to zone it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| But I owned it for 12 years under those pretenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| And I talked a little bit to a couple of commissioners about whether I would compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| The R2 is one to 24 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| The present zoning is up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| The 53,000 I spent covers 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| So if that's a common ground, if I could at least still use the engineering I've got, I would go with the 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| That concludes the speaking from the appellant and respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| So now Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I spoke with our counselor, Rob Frost, today, and he shed a little bit of light on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| I'd like to call on him to talk about some of the details of what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Before council tonight are three different matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| First is an amendment on the North City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Second is a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| And then third is Mr. Bourgeois's request to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| Today and last week I had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Bourgeois's counsel, Mr. Tipton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| And while he does a very fine job representing Mr. Bourgeois,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| we just happen to have a difference of opinion on what I feel is council's ability to do something today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2297)|
| 0:38:27| and what he disagrees and thinks council can do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| After I'm through, if Mr. Kelly on behalf of MPC or Mr. Swanson on behalf of the administration would care to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| that's perfectly fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Mr. Bourgeois's property is presently designated low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| He is seeking R2, which is a medium-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| The problem is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| City ordinance and state law prevents in zoning matters that council can't amend zoning in a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2340)|
| 0:39:10| which is inconsistent with the various plans, including, for example, the one-year plan, the North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| There is one body that can make changes that can do plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| MPC is that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| City Council is not that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| In the past couple of years, City Council has initiated a process asking MPC to do a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| One was in the second district involving North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| and the second one was in the third district involving vacant property at the intersection of Middlebrook Prike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| and either Francis Road or Venozdale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| And that's where this body asks MPC to do that process under a specific provision of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2398)|
| 0:40:08| specifically TCA 13-3-304.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| And while I don't know if folks are sympathetic or not to Mr. Bourgeois's situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2414)|
| 0:40:24| if they're going to be supportive of what he seeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| I'd respectfully submit that it's going to have to go to MPC for MPC to look at a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| And until that time, the other items on the agenda really can't be voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| until MPC has the opportunity to review it and report back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| and Council take that into consideration and vote accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Well, I don't know if Dan or Charles care to say any more on the legalities of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| but I'll give them that honor if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| I appreciate the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| I'd say that I've looked at this, and I concur that it is too late in the process at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| I know that Mr. Bourgeois wants to be excluded from the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| as other property owners were excluded about a year or so ago, but it's just too late for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| That cannot happen in this process right now, in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I just don't think that's something Council can legally undertake at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| Now, the property can be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| This property, you can consider this appeal, and you can go, this is a legislative matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| and you can go one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| but the law is just a little bit goofy with regard to the procedure you must follow in order to accomplish a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| If you agree with Mr. Bourgeois that this property ought to be rezoned back to R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| then what you'll have to do if you grant the appeal is simply refer this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| and let MPC at that time consider amendments to both the sector plan and the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2532)|
| 0:42:21| and then send it back to you after they consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Now, whatever they decide one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| you can ultimately end up rezoning it R2 when it comes back to you from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| but you'll have to send it back to MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| So if you want to grant the appeal in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| the appropriate motion to be made and voted upon would be to refer this matter back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| with a recommendation that MPC evaluate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| and amend the sector plan and the one-year plan so that it could be rezoned to R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2572)|
| 0:43:02| So that would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Mr. Kelly, do you have anything else to add with your wise planning experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2586)|
| 0:43:14| A wise man would be quiet right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| If you can do that, just stop talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| After the law director interjected the legal term goofy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| I felt like I needed to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| I think what's happening here tonight is the planning commission has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| to amend the sector plan and one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| If they choose not to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| city council cannot overrule the planning commission's decision on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| What city council has to do in order for this process to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| is to initiate their own plan amendment and send it back to planning commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| The planning commission does not have to approve the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| They just have to consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| and then it will come back to this body for consideration at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| and then you can act on the zoning if you choose to at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| This matter can be disposed of tonight if you choose to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| but he cannot get his R2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| You cannot approve R2 zoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| I don't know if that's added anything to the discussion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| but if you're sympathetic to Mr. Bourgeois's argument and want to proceed with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| then you need to initiate, in the name of Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| a plan amendment that would be heard by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| after 30 days public notice as required by any other request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| and then it would come back to you again after proper notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| and it would reappear on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Well, I really need to state my position here, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| Having met with Mr. Bourgeois a couple times, I appreciate his position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| but to suggest that requesting an exemption of the property at the time of the downzoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| would have been approved I think would have been an assumption at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| At this point, there was no given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| The neighborhood expressed concerns that a parcel that large would have been much more of an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| on the neighborhood as opposed to the smaller parcels that were downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| And Dan may correct me if I'm wrong, but the R1A allows for use on review for apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| up to 12 or 14 dwelling units per acre, totaling 65, I believe, units for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| And it also would allow for possible buffering to the residents on north of Broadview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| and, you know, all based in professional planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| He still has his development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| This appeal would go directly against the very thing we voted to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| downzoning to reduce the number of multifamily developments in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| which include over 300 properties downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| The current LDR is consistent with the plan, short- and long-term plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and as we've heard tonight, there's no real support for R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| other than just wanting to develop as many units possible on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| That's it. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Well, I mean, this may be a hard case, but to some degree I think we're chasing our tail here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| This process of zoning had postcards that tried to reach everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| who was in the area that would be affected, and there were publications in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| and there were public meetings regularly held, maybe three to five of them, over this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| And I find it hard to believe that somehow this was missed by the property owner, but it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| But there was a lawful process that was undertaken, and the zoning was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I guess if he had a beef, he should have come forward immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| He says there were reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| He wrote a letter to Congressman Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| I'm going to make two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| First, he wrote a letter to Congressman Duncan dated October 23, 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| and I think it tells a lot about what really happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| He says earlier this year there was a rezoning which was predicated by the mailing of a postcard announcing such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| I either didn't receive the postcard or received it and didn't realize its significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| I think that second part is pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| I think that he knows that he said at MPC it was mailed to his home address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| He should have gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| The presumption in law is if it's mailed with the proper postage, it got to its destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| But that doesn't even answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| As an R1A property, and I'm going to ask this to Mr. Kelly, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| this gentleman could still develop apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| They would have less density because it was a low-density residential, meaning six per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| So he could develop 28 apartments if he wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| and submitted plans that had the proper setbacks and buffering and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Dan, is it correct that R1A can allow, as a use-on-review apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| just that we have lesser density set out in this particular zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| It can permit various types of housing, apartments included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| And so you could have townhouses, apartments, other things, as long as they met the use-on-review standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| So it seems to me that this property has plenty of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| It can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| It's unfortunate that he developed, what, sketches, plans, whatever he did back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| but that was back in 2005, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Nothing has happened in the last almost ten years this property has fallen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| I think that since the community worked together to get proper zoning in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| and to stem the tide of overpopulation and too much traffic and too much danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| that we should respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| And I don't see any reason to approve the appeal at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| I mean, this is a, I see it as a really tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| And that NSCIP did the proper planning and the proper process over an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| They worked hard to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| We sat here that night on that boat, as I remember it, and scrambled to add in people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| at the very last minute that wanted to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| And we opted those properties out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| To come back and restore the R2 zoning, to me, would undermine those efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| and undermine not only NSCIP but the three other ones that I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| where we've done these group downzonings for the protection of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| However, I agree with property rights, for sure, and agree that he bought this property over 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| with an R2 zoning already on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| And that's where this thing gets a little bit dicey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| I think, like Dale Vopey said, I think the presumption is that the mailing was sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| and the mailing was received and proper notice was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| This is a tough, tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I see it on both sides, as many times we have zoning issues on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| Given the fact that Mr. Kelly just said that he can continue to develop it with multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| You can still have apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| He still has a decent density that he can use on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| I'm not sure everybody understood it that way, but that's what you're saying, Mr. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| is that he can still have a density up to 12 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| At the present time, his density would be up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| So it's still quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| In a planned residential zoning, he would have to come back with more oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| You could approve planned residential zoning at less than six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| Both require use on review approval for multifamily housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| so I don't know if there's any gain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| If the idea is to go to something higher than six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| then you would need to do the one-year plan amendment, the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| and then RP1 zoning could be considered at that time if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| Could that be considered tonight without having to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| The RP1 zoning at six units or less, I would rely on Mr. Swanson's response or Mr. Shuttlecock's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3117)|
| 0:52:08| Was it considered at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Yeah, I looked at the record at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| and I don't have any recollection of any reference in the minutes to a consideration of RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| so I think that would have to go back to MPC for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| I'll ask Mr. Bourgeois, what is your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Do you want us to take a vote on this tonight on the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| or would you rather it go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Would you rather us take a vote on it to send it back to MPC for further consideration and further study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3154)|
| 0:52:45| Do you want to clarify that, Mr. Swanson, because either way, doesn't it have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Well, we could vote down that we don't have to, but we vote down the appeal and it would be over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| and that's one option that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| To support it, I think it has to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| Well, we could amend it and just ask that this be returned to MPC, or we have to vote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| We have to vote for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3185)|
| 0:53:16| This comes to you on an appeal, but I believe that in the form that it comes to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| you could properly send it back to MPC and ask MPC to consider RP1 as a possible zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| and make a recommendation to you, because I think RP1 fits under the current both subdivision plan and one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| if I'm not mistaken, doesn't it, Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| The current plan would allow MPC to consider RP1 up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| So I think you could refer it back to MPC to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| and make a recommendation with regard to RP1 zoning and send it back to you from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| or you can send it back and ask them to consider your own initiated change of the plans, as Mr. Kelly described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3241)|
| 0:54:12| or you could just do nothing and MPC's previous action stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| So I'll go back to Ms. Bourgeois and say what would you rather see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| If you want to entertain it going back to MPC and take that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| then I will make a motion to send it back to MPC for further study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| or we'll either vote on the appeal as it's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| But you're saying further study on the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| You're talking about on the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I mean, that doesn't mean it will get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| It doesn't mean it will get voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| But, I mean, that's your chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| And I appreciate the commission trying to work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I'm so upside down at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| If it's anything only up to six per acre, then I'm not sure what my next option is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| But, you know, at over $200,000 and four and a half acres, I'm sunk on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| The trouble with the review process, too, is that, I mean, that's up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| but they can cut that any way they want to dice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So it's not even a given that I would get even the six or whatever I would ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| And on the rebuttal, and I didn't realize I was using up the only rebuttal we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| is my attorney allowed to talk to the legalities of it just for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| Not unless somebody asks a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So I would go with the vote, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Yes, Mr. Kelly, if this is sent back to MPC, what kind of time frame are we looking at for you to study that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3345)|
| 0:55:54| come back to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| If you're sending it back for consideration just of the rezoning from not changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| but just the rezoning from R2, his proposal from R2 to RP1 at six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| we can have that on the March MPC agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Which would mean it would be back before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Actually be going from R1A to RP1, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Well, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| The R1A to RP1 at a maximum density of six units per acre, we can have that on the March agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| and be back to council in early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| If you're wanting a density higher than six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| then you need to initiate the plan amendment, the north amendment to the north city sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| and to the Knoxville one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| And that would probably not be heard until April if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Yeah, I don't want to muddy the waters any more than they are, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| but he can already build the apartments under R1A under a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| where he submits plans for MPC's review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Can he do that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| He doesn't need a change to RP1 to do that, does he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| No, he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Up to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Up to six, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Okay, council, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Are there any motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| All right, so with there being no motions, then there's no action to be taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| and the appeal fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| So we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| So no 2B or no 2B, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| Commission to consider and make a recommendation to City Council regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| the possible change to the zoning classification of certain commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| properties fronting on Kingston Pike and within the area defined by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| Bearden Opportunities Plan to allow residential development and office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| development on the same sites and to the extent required amending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| one-year comprehensive development plan and zoning plan for the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| Knoxville to amend the classification of said property if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Requested by Councilmember Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| I'm going to move to approve this and then ask for an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| but I think we have some people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| We have two people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Okay, so we have two folks, Terry Faulkner and Jim Ulrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Thank you for being here, and come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I'll, as you know, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| and I'll get the timer going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Mayor, can I ask one question to Mr. Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Just a second, Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Can I ask one question to Mr. Grieve because it might help me focus on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| This looks like a request to have a mixed use along Kingston Pike in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| Is that what you're asking to send to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| We're asking for consideration of residential to be allowed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| Bearden Opportunities Plan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Along with the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| And as I said, we have an amendment to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Ms. Faulkner, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| Those boundaries, Nick, I can tell you the boundaries for the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| So, but anyway, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Terry, go ahead and tell him where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| On the north, it's I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| To the east, it's Tobler Lane, West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| And to the south, it's the railroad tracks, southern railroad tracks, and then North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| So that's the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| I don't know the square yards, but it's not a big area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| I'm speaking tonight for the members of the Bearden Council who are asking for your support for this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| which has been presented by our council representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Since 2001, when the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan was passed, our pedestrian village has continued to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3608)|
| 1:00:17| We have worked with two prior mayors and several city councils since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| This administration and council have demonstrated their support for the goals put forth in the Bearden Village Plan in many different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| two of the most recent being the new sidewalk on Sutherland and improvements to the Third Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| and I'm happy to have this opportunity to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| We have all kinds of businesses, restaurants, great schools, sidewalks, greenways, and parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| and we welcome development that will provide more homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| which will enable more Knoxvillians to live here and enjoy these amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| So you have a request for more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| That doesn't come often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Mr. Ulrich, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Jim Ulrich, 551 English Village Way, apartment 917, zip 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3672)|
| 1:01:25| Six years ago when we had to move from our rental duplex in the 4th and Gill area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| and we were unable to find a suitable place there, we started looking throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| It was at this time that I realized there was nowhere in Knox County that provided so much within a walkable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3700)|
| 1:01:53| and the Bearden area along the Kingston Pike Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| There were more groceries and drugstores than in any other area we knew of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| Banks, auto repairs, post office, schools, dry cleaning, restaurants, hardware stores, even a cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3725)|
| 1:02:15| which I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| It's near hospitals, downtown, West Town Mall, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| So why aren't we living there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| What more could you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Well, apartments for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| The only apartments nearby that served the area were at least 30 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3760)|
| 1:02:52| and except for the towers, they were updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| The area didn't have an urban feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| It looked like the rest of Kingston Pike, built for autos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| Even though the corridor is walkable in size, it was not friendly to the pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3787)|
| 1:03:18| Try walking in the rain along Kingston Pike and down the side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| You need hip boots more than you need an umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Walking on a narrow sidewalk along a street where cars are going 30, 40 miles an hour or more, it's not very pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3809)|
| 1:03:43| The only through street going east and west is Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| The biggest thing the corridor is missing is people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| That's the reason so many of the businesses have and are moving west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3837)|
| 1:04:07| Now, I'm not sure what the resolution means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| but to me it means let's take the Bearden Village Opportunity Plan of 1901 as a start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3853)|
| 1:04:24| dust it off, and use it to be creative and do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| The direction we are now going is just a newer looking Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| We need a different direction and a different look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| and if the resolution means that, then I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thanks, Mr. Allred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| Okay, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Yes, I just want to say when Ms. Faulkner replied to Councilman Della Vopi about the Bearden plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| which included West High School and Tugda Lane, that's also part of District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| so I'm supporting Councilman Grieve in his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Yes, so last meeting we, I guess, postponed a vote on the Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| and I think it's been all along that Bearden has been held up as a prime opportunity for Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| so what makes this different, or why wouldn't we incorporate these issues into the Overlay District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| as opposed to going back to MPC to more study when we've got an Overlay District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| that's hopefully going to come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| I think the key you said there is hopefully is going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| I think that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| We don't know when that's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| and what we're interested in is we have a number of folks that are interested in development at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| and this is one way in which to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| What we're interested in is looking at the existing zones to see whether or not we can add residential to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| and I think that maybe the administration might want to address your issue with overlay zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| Yeah, because that was the whole purpose, to be able to, for the district to come up with how they could address multiuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| and not near as large an area as the entire, I mean, I'm not opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| but I just don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| You've got two competing, it seems like to me, you have two competing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| and one's going to work and the other one, I would think that was the whole point of having the overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| So I don't know when you think they're going to have that back or what issues that brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| But when you said last week, is there anybody really interested in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| it's like, yeah, well, the Bearden District has been one that we've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| or people have been talking about as a potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Well, we haven't had anybody contact us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| but that doesn't mean they haven't asked about it and been curious about it, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| But we're just not prepared to adopt the corridor overlay district in the form that it was presented before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| We've been trying to get with MPC to really go through the details of it to make sure it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| and make sure it works for you and for council and for everyone else out there who lives in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| But it just wasn't in the form that we needed for it to be, and so we were going to go back and review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| And I think what we talked about last time is trying to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| as soon as we had someone in the leadership position in MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| that could help us work through the issues that were existing with the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| How would this be any different than, I guess, you know, so, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| I mean, it seems duplicate to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I think probably Mr. Kelly needs to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4065)|
| 1:07:55| I think we could look at the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| You know, from what I understand that Councilman Green is asking for is to look at the idea of creating mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| where you can add the residential element in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| And this may be an opportunity for us to apply the principles of the proposed overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| and come back to council with, you know, this is how it could work if the overlay were adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Or here is alternative B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| You can amend the various different zoning districts and include residential development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4111)|
| 1:08:39| I think it's an opportunity for us to do some further study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| and there are a number of ways that we could attack the issue of trying to create a mixed use area in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| And I think everybody has that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| It's just how you're going to get there to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| So if the motion and the resolution here with the amendment that he might add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| that could provide that flexibility to look at what you all would recommend on whether it's a overlay or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4143)|
| 1:09:16| I don't know if the motion itself actually gives that flexibility or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| but I think what I'm hearing is that Councilman Grieve is wanting us to look at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4160)|
| 1:09:30| in which mixed use development can be accomplished in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| And if that's the case, then I believe it would be we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Looking at various options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| You agree with that, Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| But I do have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Councilman Wallace on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| So you think this could become, if you do it in Bearden, then you think you could, if it goes well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| I mean, it's going to take quite a bit of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| It's not going to be a quick thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| I mean, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| We've spent some time talking about the overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| There are other people that are talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| So, I mean, could it be applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| You're going to use this as an opportunity to redraft some of the ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| or use some of the ideas that were in the overlay zone and then come back with a new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| I think, you know, rather than just say we're going to amend the C3 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| and put residential development as a committed use in the C3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| I don't think Council would want us to do that necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| without some kind of standards being included in with that that would govern the type of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| Are you still going to maintain commercial on the first floor, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| or are we going to just permit stand-alone residential developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| There are a number of issues, I think, that need to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| and we can look at it from the framework of the proposed overlay zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| and we can look at it as an alternative to by amending the other zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| And, you know, at this point, I don't know how it would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| Well, we talked about the overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| We talked about five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| You know, the original proposal was five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| We sat here and pushed it back, and I said, look, it ought to be bigger than five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Five acres wouldn't even encompass, you know, one good-sized shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| And that was the whole point, was to take in big, bigger, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| I mean, I'm not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| I just, I mean, you're sending it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I mean, it's just that's the way to get to the overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I'm okay with that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Well, what I'm interested in is we have a particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| and we have some interest in having residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Now, I think we need to look at the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| We need to look at what that means in terms of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| It also means that we have to look at heights of buildings, apartments, condos, whatever they might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| What I'm not interested in is having this drag out for a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| and have every other part of the city look into it because all of a sudden we're thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| well, it ought to be a corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| I don't think this is a corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| What we're looking at is a particular area that's zoned a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| and the way it's set up right now, we cannot have residential units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| And so what I'm asking for is I'm asking MPC to look at the Bearden Opportunities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| to see what it is that we need to do in order to have residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| to build the density that we're looking for in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| And the thing that I don't want to see is I don't want to see this prolonged, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| for several years like another situation that I'm very familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| I think you are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Well, maybe that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Because we have the interest right now that something can happen in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| to do what not only the Bearden Council but a number of the people in the Bearden area would like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| And so I think one of the ways, and maybe I shouldn't say the quickest way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| but one of the ways is we already know what it's zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| What do we have to do to those zoning areas in order to allow residential in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Now, if the outcome from this ends up that this is information that can be used for a corridor overlay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| But, you know, again, my idea of a corridor overlay is a corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| We're talking about a whole area in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| which I'd like to see done and sent to MPC for study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| We can follow that direction also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| You understand my direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Saul's going to do is change the resolution so that it's a little broader mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| for them to look at the best way to accomplish integrating residential and office and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| And they can come back with a new zone or whatever it is they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Let's give them a mandate to study the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan and come up with a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| And they're the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Let them figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I think that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Well, I do want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| I do want to clarify it with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Is that right for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| So now we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| If there's not any more discussion right now, let's go to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| What I'd like to do, Mayor, is I'd like to amend the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| In item number two, or paragraph number two, I'd like to delete the word large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| and also delete fronting on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| This is for clarification that we are talking about the entire Bearden Opportunity Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| And in paragraph five, to delete the word certain and also fronting on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| In section one, again, delete the word certain and delete fronting on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Is there any discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| You all understand the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4491)|

| 1:14:54| It's not a corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4494)|

| 1:15:34| percent to the Homemakers Program for a contract sales price of $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4534)|

| 1:15:47| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quick claim deed to Stacy Campfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| for one parcel of property located at 124 East Oak Hill Avenue within the limits of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| of Knoxville percent to the Homemakers Program for a contract sales price of $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| I vote against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Councilman Dallaropi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Yes, I've already spoken to Becky Waite about this, but I think it's important to air because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| we have a public official or a prior public official involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| To the extent that Mr. Campfield gets this property, he is held to the requirement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| it be rehabilitated to proper standards, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| We're not going to face a buy, hold, and rent as a slumlord or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| He's going to develop it according to the standards of the Homemaker Plan or he loses the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Anybody who applies to purchase property from the city through the Homemakers Program is held to the same standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4598)|
| 1:16:47| We check to be sure that there aren't any outstanding code violations, that all property taxes are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| and then we monitor the progress of the rehabilitation throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| They have to get permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| We inspect it throughout the process and make sure that it is completely up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| So at the end of the day, we get a property that was blighted and unused and put back in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| It serves the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| It pays taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| It's a functioning part of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| This was a tax-foreclosed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| It's been vacant for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4642)|

| 1:20:44| Yeah, Jim Hagerman is here, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| I don't have any problem with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| It looked like in the categories of activities that were going to be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| there was a whatever a geopack training program is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| which seemed somewhat different than designing a sidewalk extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| and it sounded almost like a side item we coupled together with this bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| I don't have any problem with that either, but I'm just wondering why it's in this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| It was like about $14,000 or something for a geopack training session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| like unto what the state would give you if you went to their program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| and I didn't know if that was intimately connected with the sidewalks or just another thing we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| This is Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| It is software training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| Our civil designer group has had this software around for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| and it's a big change from what they're used to using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| All of the consultants and TDOT uses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| We have to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| This was a way that we decided gave us good value to work with the consultants that we work with directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4914)|
| 1:22:04| to see how they use the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| So it gets your guys up to speed so that they can interact with our consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| That's correct, and so they can learn some tricks so that they can be really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| Instead of just like hanging your laundry on it like a health device you get for your home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| then you never use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| You can actually use this once you learn how to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Walking track, one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4949)|

| 1:22:38| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Charles Blalock & Sons, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| in an amount not to exceed $1,892,639.41 for the Holbrook Drive bridge replacement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4963)|

| 1:22:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Oh, Councilman Campin, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| I just wanted to ask Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Have we not voted on this once or twice already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| We did the design work, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| You have voted on it several times because there's been a bunch of right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| and right-of-way has been a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| In fact, if you want me to tell you a long and complicated story sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| but I'm not up for it now, sometime, it's a pretty good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| But we finally got through all of the right-of-way process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| and we're finally ready to build the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| You voted on design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| You voted on redesign because when we took it to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| they wanted sidewalks and bike lanes, so there was some additional design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| And then I don't know how many right-of-way purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| Now we're ready to go, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Now we're ready to actually do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| But it will have a bike lane underneath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| It will have a bike lane on Church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| On Holbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| On Holbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| The bridge will be wide enough for a bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| Okay, but not wide enough through Church, underneath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| It's Fountain underneath, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Fountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| There's a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| There is a church on the upper road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| What's this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| And I can't tell you how wide it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Oh, Fountain, that's Fountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I can't tell you how wide it is on Fountain, but I'm sure it's wider than it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| It will be wider than it is now because it's quite constricted, if I remember right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| You get to run into those steel columns on the lower road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5067)|

| 1:26:14| Okay, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5174)|

| 1:26:18| which we discussed at the January 15th workshop regarding the pension items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5178)|

| 1:26:34| There is one number that is incorrect, and that is on page 396 under restricted investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5194)|
| 1:26:43| Leverage shall not exceed 350%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5203)|

| 1:26:49| Only change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5209)|

| 1:27:32| of the Industrial Development Board as defined by TCA Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5260)|

| 1:27:42| Is your light on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Okay, we have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Do you want to go ahead and hear him first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Okay, Mr. Seymour, you know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| I'll set my timer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| I am here on behalf of the Tennessee and LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| and we would ask you all to approve this pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| which will go to the Industrial Development Board Monday, the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| We do have one issue with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| We've been long working on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| It turns out part of it's in the 500-year FEMA floodplain map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| and we're trying to resolve that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| Any help we can get on that will be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Right now, I don't think we can get a building permit for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| So we're in that quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| That's true, but we should mention this is a part of trying to get the financing package together along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| Of course, this financing package would be necessary to get the hotel done when it's to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| and to help support the convention center in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| We get the financing lined up, but we won't take action on that until the FEMA issue is solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| Council takes action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| It will go to IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| IDB will take action, but they will not be able to move towards closure until they get the other issues resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| Sorry, is there anything else, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| We did jump in on your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| I'm well under five minutes, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Mayor, I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Let me get Councilman Del Vopi first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| I think he had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| I just wanted to maybe ask Bob Wetzel or Art Seymour to just tell us a little bit about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| because every time there's a pilot, someone's always asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| Half the time it's me, but it could be others in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| So just tell us about the project, what we're trying to accomplish, and what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| The building under question here is the old Tennessee office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| It's down on Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| It was built for the World's Fair, which was 30-some years ago now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| And it's empty, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| And it's empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| It is empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| It has been transferred to this LLC and trying to put together a financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| It's been a long struggle because it's hard to get hotels financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| They're looking at approximately 72 guest rooms and then also 12 residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| They'd like to make those condos, but they're not quite sure how the market will be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| So they're going to work for 72 guest rooms and 12 residential units at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| They'd like to get under construction, obviously, as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| and 12 to 18-month construction schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| Does it have a 12-year sort of payout horizon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| We're recommending a 12-year pilot on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| Once again, two years for the construction, 10 years for the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| This is going to be an asset to the convention center, having these additional hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Bob, I think we were talking earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Aren't most of our pilots between, what, 10 and 12 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| They run anywhere from 10 to 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| but we've really been working to get them systemized down to this 10- to 12-year range is where we'd like to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| I've got a question for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| I know that the North Shore thing came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| and I had to begin to look at floodplains and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| What kind of schedule do you all have in terms of trying to get this project done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| And is the FEMA situation holding you up, potentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Ideally, if you all pass this resolution, it goes to the IDB on Monday and passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5478)|
| 1:31:29| We would start work sometime in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Right now we can't get a building permit because FEMA maps have been amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| and part of this building, at least a portion of it, is in the 500-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5497)|
| 1:31:46| It's hard to believe if you look from the viaduct down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| but we're not in a position to get a building permit at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| So we're sort of in a quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Well, won't we as a city, and correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| I know in looking at the, again, at the North Shore area in terms of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| part of some of our facilities are in the floodplain, right, the old convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| and that if we wanted to do anything to those, we couldn't because it is in the floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| Is that correct, Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| It is. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| The convention exhibition center, when this amendment was made to the FEMA maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| that particular facility that we own was also affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| So we've been working with the developer of the Tennessee Inn because we have the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| And so we do believe and agree with the developer that there was miscalculations made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| and we are going to do our own modeling and present that to FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| and request that that line be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| They're going to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| We're going to be doing it for our own property at the KCEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| but we're going to help assist as much as we possibly can because, as the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| this is very important that the Tennessee Inn get redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| So we'll be helping as much as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| We've had engineers look at it canon and canon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| And we've had our own consultants as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| So you're communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| It seems like both of us, we all have the same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| We do, and we've been working on this together now pretty intently for the last almost 90 days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| So time is of the essence on this project to hold bank loan commitments and investors together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| It's a very complicated project because we're trying to separate the Tennessee Inn from the ownership of the Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5611)|
| 1:33:41| These are not issues you all need to worry about, but we need to worry about and then get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| And time is of the essence if we're going to hold our investors and the bank loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| And just out of curiosity, how was he able to renovate the lower level of the Holiday Inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| where he has his ballrooms and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| That was actually done prior to the revision of the FEMA map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| Okay, so when did FEMA come through and do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| Unfortunately for Mr. Kazan, it was about the time that he took over the ownership of the property from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Was it October of 2013?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| When FEMA does something like this, and this is just for my information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| do they notify the city that they're coming in to re-flood our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| They do, but without getting too technical here and in the weeds, we did object to how they did their modeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5669)|
| 1:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| But they didn't listen, so they did it their own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| I just wondered if the schedule was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Okay, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Seems like a perfect example of the federal government getting in the way of local progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| What is the timeline for changing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Are we able to issue a building permit if our engineers tell us that it's safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5701)|
| 1:35:09| Are we able to issue a building permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| We can't issue a building permit by ordinance, regardless of our feelings about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| FEMA, the website, the standard line is it takes at least 90 days for this map revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| But as I just said before, we're going to be really pushing our contacts as FEMA as much as we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| to try to help move this along as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| And that's one reason for this action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| The next IDB board meeting is at least 90 days out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| They just meet quarterly, so we're trying to line up for that February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Okay, is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| 11N is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| to negotiate and accept from Guyo Properties LLC payments in lieu of Avaloran taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| with respect to property located at 100 South Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| of the Industrial Development Board as defined in TCA Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Okay, counsel, we have Mr. Wayne Kline has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| So if it's okay with counsel, we'll go ahead and hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Thank you for being here, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| My name is Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| I'm at Hodges, Dowdy, and Carson, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| It is my honor and privilege to be before you for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| We're here on behalf of Guyo Properties, who wants to partner with Balter Brewing Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| and I've talked to almost everybody here about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| You see a picture of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| What we're looking for is a $3 million investment from private investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| to develop this project, which is a restaurant and a brewery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| and a partnership with the City of Knoxville through this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| to redevelop the corner of West Jackson and Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| where that BP station used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| We're going to take the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| We're going to make it double in square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| We're going to put a restaurant in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| We're going to have 36 to 40 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| We're going to have a brewery there on site with a seven-barrel capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| and we're hoping that you will allow this resolution to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| and let us go to the IDB board this week so we can break ground as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Counsel Mandela-Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Yeah, again, back to, I guess, Bob, we're limiting this to 12 years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| And at the end of the day, what will the property be valued at for tax purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| The estimate right now is $2.5 million will be the estimate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| I forget the number on that, but it's nowhere close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Obviously, this has been sitting vacant except for occasional summertime uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| It's had a few places in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| And that, after the duration of the pilot, which helps make the loan work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| that will redound to the city in terms of taxes that are levied, and the county, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Right now, the total revenue that's received, city and county, is like $7,000, $8,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| Post-project, it's going to be closer to $80,000 or $40,000 per year for the both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5893)|

| 1:39:04| So what is Geo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| It's pronounced Geo, but it is a mountain range in the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| I think it's the second largest mountain range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5951)|

| 1:39:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| For what purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| To clarify it for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| He may have mooted my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| I'm just trying to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I was going to say that I would like to divide the questions so that number one is separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| for the remaining two, three, and four because I think there is some controversy over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| first item, but you're sending it back to clarify in what way perhaps you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| The entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Just send the whole thing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| Send the whole thing back with some kind of deadline of getting it back here or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| I don't think we have a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| We'll bring it back when we are prepared to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| I don't need to divide the questions since there's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| You want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Just what's better to do it this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Well, frankly, it's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| It's better to send it all back right now because there has to be a procedure followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| if we don't do it in this fashion that we're not really prepared to follow tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| So let's just do this and then it will come back to you in due course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Okay, so we have a motion to send this back to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6061)|

| 1:41:54| Okay, for starters, on the Cumberland Avenue project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| people are saying that they think it's a bad idea to start during football season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| Can it start in the summertime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| Are the businesses going to be compensated like when you guys tore up the Henley Street Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6128)|
| 1:42:18| Okay, on the Knoxville Coliseum remodeling project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6138)|

| 1:42:23| Yeah, but I'm saying, you know, they were compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| That's what I get for reading newspapers too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| Anyhow, on the Knoxville Coliseum remodeling project, can it be done in the summertime too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| And when will it start and the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6155)|

| 1:42:45| When it comes to bids, they say you had two bids, one for $20 million and one for $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6165)|
| 1:42:53| and someone forgot about the labor costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| And Mayor O'Hara, if you are running for mayor again, you got my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| And also, before I forget, on the noise ordinances that you guys passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| does that count for Market Square, you know, like when they have like concerts and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| And will that be enforced and also like for like shows at the International or the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| if they go over like a certain time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| Okay, Benny, you know, we don't do back and forth answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150203?start=6204)|
