| 0:08:13| Is Kim here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I can barely see you over the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Would you like to hear from Kim first, or do you all want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| No, I'll make a presentation, and we'll hear from Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| I might have other questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Okay, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| I'm certainly in favor of the idea of saving Old South High and of rehabilitating it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| assisted living or senior living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I think that's, I think those are good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| I think it's nice to save the architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I'm concerned, though, that this council has been asked first to purchase this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| which we did for either $189,000 or $207,000, depending on which figure you take from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| We then spent somewhere between $40,000 or $50,000 stabilizing the building, putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| up boards, protecting it, mowing it, doing all those things, which turned into a lien| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| that was adjusted in the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| But now we're turning around and selling it for $1,000, and I'm frankly, I'm surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| It seems to me that we're always struggling to find dollars to do things like sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| in neighborhoods, which all ask for more sidewalks than we can possibly afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I think someone told us our list of priority projects is $139 million of backlog, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| we will get to in, I guess, 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| You know, here is a property that has some value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| It's two and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| It was appraised in 2014 at $189,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| One appraiser, Mr. Broom, had it at $169,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| So there was some value there, and we spent some money stabilizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Obviously it deteriorated some, just because of non-occupancy and time, but I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| land alone was appraised either at $45,000 or $60,000, depending on which appraiser's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| value you look at, and they had sales from the community in that area, and the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| per acre was somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000, and we got two and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| We now have a revised appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| The appraiser that told us it was worth $189,000 now says, well, if you demolish the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| it costs $180,000 or something, and if you take up the asbestos and remediate the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| you got money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Well, to me, that's a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| I think we're getting ahead of ourselves somehow, or at least shortchanging the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| We're going to see a request for a pilot to do some of that remediation of asbestos or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| whatever, and we're going to be leaning towards probably doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| It's been mentioned in the papers submitted by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| I don't understand why he can't pay a market price, at least for the land, which is $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| or $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| I don't understand why we're just, you know, we got a token price, $1,000, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| it's unfair to the taxpayers to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| You know, I guess they arrive at, it really has a negative value, like I said, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| tear it down and remediate it and turn it into a building lot, but that's not what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| The appraiser that looked at it and said $189,000 said he looked at it with the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| of converting a school to a senior center-type building, and that's been done, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| at Flanagan and Oakwood Lincoln Parks School and several other structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| We're doing it at Fifth Avenue, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| I just think that we ought to be remunerated some for the cost we expended in setting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| aside, buying it, and holding it stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| So I think it's, I object to the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| I think it's unfair to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Well, I can appreciate Councilman Dellivope's diligence, and I think he's been consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| with that mindset throughout his tenure on council, but, you know, I think it goes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| little bit deeper than just, you know, his accurate description, but I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| a lot more history there, and I can assure you the district that I represent, the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| South High School sits, there's a lot of interest, and I want to go through just a chronological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| order of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| It's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I don't want to belabor this, but it's much deeper than we're shortchanging the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| I mean, I wholeheartedly disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| You know, the school has sat there since 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| I forget exactly the date that it was opened, but it's been there a long, long time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| it's unfortunately sat empty for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| I know back when, in I think 2002, the community raised hard-earned $5,000 from South Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=773)|
| 0:13:02| Villians, and South Knoxville's not probably one of the richest districts that reside in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| this city, and that's a lot of money for the folks in the first district to have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| for the repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| They cared that much about the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| And then in 2005, we'll think back, and the county commission rejected a proposal from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| Lee Birch to purchase the building for $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| So we've got ten times that on the table tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| He was going to invest, and I say that jokingly, but he was going to invest, I think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| $3 million to develop condos, and I can remember very vividly Commissioner Paul Pinkston saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=819)|
| 0:13:48| we can get more for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| And that was then, and it's 2016, and it's still sitting there, and it's still deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| So that didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| County attempted to sell the building as is for $25,000, no responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Still sat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| It was auctioned off for $117,000 in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| The Better Building Board declared the building unfit for human habitation and issued a 120-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| order to the owner to repair and secure the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| And in 2011, this council, in its wisdom, asked for a historic H1 overlay to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| the building, and the wisdom of this council approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| In 2012, the city invoked the Demolition by Neglect Ordinance, notifying the owner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| numerous building codes violations, providing them 30 days to begin, 180 days to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| It still sits there, deteriorating to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| It's an eyesore for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| I understand, Councilman Della Volpe, where you're going, and I get that, but we did get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| as you said, $35,000 in back taxes and a lien of about $30,000 that we got as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| But when you look at the condition of the building itself, this is going to be, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| I'm not a developer, but I can assure you, if you've taken the time to go look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| that it is going to be a real challenge for Rick Dover to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| And I think if we go through all the steps that you suggested, then perhaps this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| it's my understanding that this is a razor thin project, and it could be the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| in it not working and working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| So I ask this council, do we want to take that risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| And I hope that the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| But this project is so good on many fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Number one, the neighborhood, the feedback that I've gotten is in favor, well, the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| community is in favor of preserving the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| It's a beautiful, the exterior of the building is still nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| We can make this into a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| The community is in favor of the development that Mr. Dover is going to, is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| We saw the renderings the other day, it's going to be a beautiful building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| His track record is of success for renovations of these type buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| But really, the real core of this goes to the thousands of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| I asked Monty Stanley the other day when we were at the, Friday at the announcement, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| said, Monty, you graduated from here, and he said, yeah, not only did I, but my dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| did, and I think his dad's probably close to his 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| So there's thousands of people that have gotten their education through South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| We can't take another risk at not moving this project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| We've got a willing participant, again, somebody with a track record of success and renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| of these type buildings, so I urge the council, and I hope that the council will approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| and move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| It'll be before us again, I don't know how many other times, but we need to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| first step tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Nick, and thank you, and I'm not going to repeat a lot of the things you said, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| I fully agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| I think if anyone goes out there and looks at that building and realizes that once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| sell it to Rick, we no longer have the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| He's the one that has the risk, and it's a great risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| It's a very, very fine line between what he's going to have to do to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| What gives me a great deal of confidence is his track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| He's a quality developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| He's proved it with Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| He's proved it in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| He's proving it on the Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Some other projects, even some brand new ones that he's started, and so, again, we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| taking the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| He's the one taking the risk, and I think that the other thing that we need to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| at is, sure, we've spent some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| We've spent some money on a building that's extremely important to your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| It has a lot of memories for a lot of people, and I think from a historical perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| and a preservation perspective, we need to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| I think also the thing to think about is, yes, we've spent some money, but we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| money in all the districts, maybe for different things, and I think the other thing to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| is how many people stepped forward, how many people had the opportunity and the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| to bid on this, and you've got one bid, and you have a quality developer, and I urge the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| council to go ahead and support this and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I support what my colleagues said here tonight, and like Councilman Pavel said, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| I mean, when you look at it on paper, there's some bad numbers, but that really goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| to decisions made years ago, and the question for us is, you know, what are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| do with it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| And there's sort of two parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| One is we're actually selling it for the highest bid, but I think it's more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| you know, and I think in a situation like that, we have an obligation not just to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| the highest bid, but to do our best to get it to be a successful property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| It's been blighted for years and years, and this step we're taking tonight, and the example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| is right in the 4th District, is Oakwood School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I mean, it turned a real eyesore, a real blight of that neighborhood and turned it into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1176)|
| 0:19:47| beautiful asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I guess it's in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Anyway, when you're at large, you don't know all the districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| That's no excuse, Mr. Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| We'll forgive you this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Brownlow School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| There's just been a number of schools that have been done well that I think really turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| it, that have been repurposed and turned it into real assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| And Park Ridge and Brownlow School and Oakwood School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| So hopefully this will go, so I'm definitely supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I just wanted to add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| If you remember what the County Commission did, in essence they got greedy, they kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| So what do we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Do we want to send this out for bid in another year or two years and see what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| So I think we just need to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I'd like to add something here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| That building's been closed for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| It took 14 years for County Commission to come up with a plan, or for the County, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| the County Mayor, working with Knox Heritage to come up with a plan that then was rejected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| for the exact same reasons as you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| And then now, 11 years later, we're in a position, you know, so we tried to, they followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| as said, you know, it went to auction, the person who bought it wasn't able to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| It got worse and worse and worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| And just imagine this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| This is in the heart, and you are a neighborhood supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| You are a big supporter of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| And I like the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I don't like the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| This sits smack in the middle of a neighborhood with an elementary school, Dogwood Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| School right next door, the teacher center attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Right behind it is a recreation center where kids go after school, people from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| When you imagine that we have had to board this thing up because you've got the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| there who can get into the building, you have folks who can get in, we have calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| you know, this is something that for 25 years this neighborhood has been dealing with, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| the last 11, particularly, with this type of, as it slowly deteriorates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| So we have, this is the time to move now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| It's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| It's the right thing to do for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| And I implore council, and I know Kim Trent, I guess we, if you all are, it's okay, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| let Kim Trent speak to this now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| We don't want to be another, you know, 14 years, it'll just be a big mess if we wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I'm Kim Trent, Executive Director at Knox Heritage, I live at 516 Carter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| And I do remember 14 years ago being in that building with the mayor and Becky Wade and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| Monty Stanley and all the residents in that community coming together to clean it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and put their own sweat and labor into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| And the thousands of people who signed the petition to save it, the community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| where one of the top priorities that came out of it was a senior living facility as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| one of the options that people wanted in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| And so I'm a bit nervous tonight because we had this solved back in around 2004, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| and county commissioners said the same thing, we can get more for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| Well, I'm here tonight to ask you don't pull a pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| That is what killed that deal at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| That building would be on the tax rolls, it would be occupied today if we hadn't gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| greedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| This is a great opportunity to fix this building, get it back on the tax rolls, impact positively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| the property values around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| When it's fixed, everything else around it will grow and the city's revenues from taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| that are collected in an appreciating neighborhood will more than offset this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| So this is a very important place and that you're lucky enough to have a developer like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Rick Dover show up and take it on is rather amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| And I'm here to say we've worked with him on the Alexander Inn in Oak Ridge, we've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| with him on Oakwood School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Those buildings were literally collapsing, I mean falling through the floor collapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| And he has the skills and the financial ability to do a project like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| And if you ever went into Oakwood School before or Alexander Inn before, which I did, wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| masks in some cases, and then go in now and see seniors who are living in these beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| places with millions of dollars in investment, with affordable opportunities for some seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| and a lot of seniors in these buildings, I just, I don't know how this could be turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| This is a no brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| So I hope that you will support the proposal in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Look at the big picture, not the acquisition price, but the money that will save the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| and its liabilities and the money that will come to the city in the long term by facilitating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| this investment, which is the role the city should play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Councilman Delivosi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Well, maybe my complaint is what happened a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| Why were we tricked into paying $189,000 for a building that wasn't worth anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| I have said from the very beginning, I thought this was a great project, and I'm glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| see the school saved, and I'm glad to see the use that's proposed, and I'm glad someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| like Rick Dover, instead of a fly-by-night operator, I just think somehow we either got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| tricked two years ago when we paid $189,000 for this property, or we're ignoring its real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| value and we should get paid at least for the land, which was $45,000 or $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| I am not opposed to the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I'm just concerned that we didn't negotiate very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Becky Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Becky Way, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| In preparation to acquire property, we are required to get property appraisals, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| is what we did for South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| We got appraisals from two certified appraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| We then had those reviewed by another appraiser to verify that these were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| Both of those appraisers made corrections to their appraisals, and we went with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| number that they concurred with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| The money that was used to acquire this property is chronic problem property acquisition funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| that this council has allocated for that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| These are capital funds, and these are monies that we use to acquire properties that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| considered chronically problem properties, as well as blighted and deteriorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| So we do this on other properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| We don't get our money back on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| When we sell them, whether it's through an RFP or through Homeacres, we don't, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| even out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| But we do this to get rid of the blight and improve neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Okay, so we have a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| We already have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Mayor, I'd like to congratulate Rick for moving ahead on this project, and I know he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| I don't know if you'd like to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Now that he's already voted, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Now that he knows what the outcome is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| It's going your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Well, I don't know if, I'm Rick Dover, General Manager of Dover Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I hope you all, if you get a chance, take a look at the proposal that we made through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=1647)|

| 0:36:08| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2169)|

| 0:36:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Do we have anyone signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2192)|

| 0:36:35| Mr. Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Oh, yes we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| I'm sorry, Mr. Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| I'd like to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Hello, Mr. Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Rodney Arnold, 7210 Thornbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| I want to start by thanking, before I share my thoughts, a couple of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| I want to thank Ms. Palmer, who I've not met before tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| but she and Law Director Swanson have been very, very patient and kind with me over the spring and summer months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| if I've had many questions, emails, phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| and I just really want to appreciate her and him publicly for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| We're here tonight representing 11 pastors from all across our city of churches of different sizes, denominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| Two are Southern Baptist churches, like my own is, One Life Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Some are Presbyterian. Others are of different denominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| We represent a total of more than 25,000 members across our city and our combined churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| I want to start by saying that our support of this ordinance is not in any way a reflection of any theological stance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| or of any biblical interpretation of the advantages or disadvantages of alcohol consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| In fact, among our churches are some that require their staff to not partake in alcohol at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| They call them teetotalers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| And then there are others who, quite honestly, might have a keg at their next event and everything in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| The reason I'm here on behalf of those pastors supporting this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| is simply because of the reality that the ordinance as it stands does not protect churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| and we would actually argue hurts churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| I'm sure 80 years ago when this ordinance first came into effect on the hills of Prohibition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| it did protect churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| When many members were walking to church, churches were in communities in rural places that are now no longer rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| But I'm sure that the city at the time did not anticipate that a convenience store or grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| within 50 feet of a church today would be selling alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And I'm sure that the city at the time did not anticipate that the state would create a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| that would allow a bar to move in next door to my church as the law stands today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| and open right up if that establishment simply got the state liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| The problem is that many restaurants, a Pizza Inn, a Chuck E. Cheese, a local establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| may not want or maybe cannot afford the state liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| which puts landlords and developers in a very difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Do I lease and sell my property to a church and in doing so make it very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| for an establishment selling alcohol to come in next door or even within 300 feet of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Or do I say no to the church and lose the foot traffic it would bring to my center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| lose the business it would bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| And that is why we would say this very issue hurts churches and, by the way, even possibly the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| because the unique issue of a church leasing a building, which happens quite frequently these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| is that church is actually paying real estate tax as the landlord passes that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| Gone are the days also where a church would purchase some land and build a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| because in our city that's become increasingly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| On the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors commercial website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| there are just 56 properties currently listed that are 6 acres or larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| which would be the size needed to build a church of 10,000 to 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| But many of those properties, due to topography or cost, would not allow a church to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| However, you compare that to the fact that there's nearly 180 properties listed for lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| that are of 10,000 square feet or more that are in mixed-use developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| They're in retail centers. They're in shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| However, many of those landlords will not be open to this, and that's been our experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| There's a church that we work with on Clinton Highway that invested quite a bit of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| into developing a little strip center. They were in a little strip center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| And they were just a few spots down from a pizza restaurant who just earlier this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| maybe it was late last year, I forget the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| the pizza restaurant decided they wanted to start selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| but could not afford to go through the state liquor license process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| So they went to the landlord and said, We're going to have to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| And it put this landlord in a position of, Do I keep the church or do I keep the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| And that landlord chose to get rid of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| This was a bad move for everyone involved. It was bad for the church for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| It was bad for the pizza restaurant that lost foot traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| It was bad for the landlord that still to this day has not leased out that now vacant space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| We have also had this same experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Our church started seven years ago, and we've been blessed to grow quickly to two campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| We've had four different properties that we've been in outside of Powell High School where we began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| One was a rental facility, the Jubilee Banquet Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| that there was question, as has happened in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| that our ambiguous definition of church building can keep facilities like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| from even renting to a church, because if we define a church as a building that's used for regular worship service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| does that include the movie theater? Does that include the banquet center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| We found the same thing happened when we went to lease an old food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| The landlord wanted us there but was afraid that this very ordinance would prevent him from getting future business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| We had the same issue come up when we had the opportunity to purchase the 12-year vacant Just for Feet building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| at Knoxville Center Mall that we've been able to purchase and will be opening soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| But I think we can all agree that it was best for our city for that eyesore to have new life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| So for that reason, I just want to encourage you on behalf of our churches to support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| And I want to close by saying this. It's not just startup churches that this affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| In our group of 11 churches is represented Cedar Springs Presbyterian, the largest church in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| and Faith Promise Church is one of the other larger churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Faith Promise has a campus and a retail center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Pathways Church in South Knoxville is in an old goodies building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| Severe Heights Baptist Church has a campus in an old food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Grace Baptist Church has a ministry in a retail strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Coke's Berry has their contemporary service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Park West Church of God started a campus in a movie theater and the list goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And so for those reasons, on behalf of those churches, we ask that you support this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| as it is what's best for churches in our city. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you, sir. Vice Mayor Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| I think that Reverend Arnold has really not only researched but expresses it very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| and he and I have had several conversations about this, and I would hope that we would move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| I think he's really addressed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Me, I personally had not thought about the restrictions that we were actually putting on churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| in terms of what they could do and where they could locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| So I would urge my colleagues to move ahead with this. Right, George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you. Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Yeah, I guess I'm questioning the timing of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| There was a discussion at one of our beer board meetings maybe a month ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| that this was an issue that would be considered sensitive and provoke a lot of comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| and it was suggested that a task force or someone be formed to contact all of the various entities involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| and invite them to come and share their views with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| And that suggestion was not taken up, and now we simply have it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| And I agree that I thought Pastor Arnold did a great job of giving the reasons why one would do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| and why it might be good for churches and businesses, but I'm afraid that we're acting prematurely at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| It strikes me that 11 churches signing a petition in a city that's got over 800 churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| doesn't scratch the itch of what is the consensus view of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| and I don't know that it isn't premature to act on this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I would suggest that we consider taking this up at the workshop we're going to have in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| and discuss it there because we need to invite churches and other entities to come forward and speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| and not have them feel like they've been blindsided by this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| So it might be a great idea, but I don't think we've really vetted it very well. That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you. Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Thank you. As chair of the Beer Board, we have taken this back and forth multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| and I had anticipated there would be public displeasure with this, but this has now been advertised for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| It's been on the news coverage about this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| I haven't received a single call concern about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| When we were considering it a few months ago, there were concerns about removing the distance issue at schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| but this only addresses churches, and I'm going to be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| I guess one of the epiphanies I had was when we gave beer permits to three churches in the past six months at the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2705)|
| 0:45:15| and it strikes me as being quite unfair to say, okay, you're a church, you can have the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| but if you're 300 feet too close, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| So I'm going to be supporting this tonight, and I think it will have a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and I'm sure if there's a lot of opposition, they will come out of the woodwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| I guess I'm just wondering, I was just wishing Pastor Arnold was here back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| My frustration with the whole thing is that it sort of creates this idea that there is this distance setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| when the reality is all that's needed is you have to get a liquor permit to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| You know, for example, in March when we took up this issue, the headline in the Knoxville News Sentinel was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Knoxville City Council upholds 300-foot setbacks for beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| Well, I think if you just read the headline, you would think, well, you can't get a beer permit within 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| which is not the case at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| It just requires you to get a liquor permit, and then you could get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| I mean, the headline, to me, should have read, Knoxville City Council still requires a liquor permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| to sell within 300 feet of a church, school, or funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| Anyway, I just want to thank Councilman Grieve, Vice Mayor Grieve, for bringing this forward, and I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Yeah, well, I agree with Councilman Della Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I think we're way out in front of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| We don't need to lose sight of the fact that not only are we talking about this particular ordinance covers churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| it covers daycares, schools, hospitals, a whole array of different places that are sanctuaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2817)|
| 0:47:07| These are places, these are safe havens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| These are places where people go to reflect, to pray, to cry, to hurt, to learn, to heal, a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2830)|
| 0:47:21| And people don't watch what we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| It's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| I mean, the pastor and I were emailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| We disagree on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| But my fear is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Number one, the churches, and, you know, he's got 11 churches, and Councilman Della Bope has said 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| I don't know how many churches are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| But they'll find out, unfortunately, the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| I mean, I think I see how this vote's going to go, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| But it's, you know, the fear that I have is at 12 noon when, you know, the bar opens up, it's got the patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2868)|
| 0:47:58| and they're having their bimonthly motorcycle run to raise money for some great organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| and you're right in the middle of communion or you're right in the middle of the Lord's Prayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| or whatever you're doing in church, and here starts all the motorcycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| or here starts the game, the football game where you play the boards and all the locker room talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2896)|
| 0:48:25| and all in jest and good time, but it can have unintended consequences for the church next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| And I just haven't, I mean, I don't doubt what the pastor's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| but I just think that we're going down a path without a lot of discussion, to Councilman Della Bope's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| and without input from churches in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| We've been 80 years, I think, was the site of how long this has been in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| and I don't know why we're in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| I don't think this is being bum-rushed through, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| but I would be in favor of moving it to that workshop as well and giving people time to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| So I'm not going to support it, but that's my two cents worth on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Okay, so Councilman Della Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I wonder if you all would accept a friendly amendment where instead of deleting it from the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| if you want to go forward tonight as opposed to defer it for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| if you would, instead of deleting a church building, you would have a proviso that says unless consent is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2970)|
| 0:49:38| So, in other words, a church could say, sure, I don't mind having one within 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| because I'm in a shopping center and I expect that kind of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| I'm not necessarily in favor of that, but, I mean, that would be one way to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| instead of striking it off the books, requiring some kind of notice and consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| before a less than 300-foot distance permit was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| I'll just throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| I certainly don't pretend to speak for the administration on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| but this had generally been discussed if a pastor came in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| well, we're good with the such and such business locating in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| It could be a selective enforcement of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Then what would happen potentially if the next pastor came in and decided that he or she didn't like the idea of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| or if the hierarchy of the church needed to have say so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| and a pastor might have inadvertently and accidentally stepped out of line in responding to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| So it sets up a potential bureaucratic nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| I'll withdraw my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| If you think it's going to cause problems, that wasn't my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I was just going to say I agree with Council Lady Palmer from the standpoint that I've not received a single email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| phone call, or anything in regards to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| and was pleased that I did hear from the churches that I heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| Pastor Arnold said that he would even contact additional churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| But I think that we pass this on first reading and we see what happens in the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| whether or not there's a ground swell, and we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| So I would like to call the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Could you give us your phone number so that they'll know who to contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| 637-0382.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| It's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Y'all can be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| I'll be more than happy to talk to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Is that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| So we have three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Six ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Did you get the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Brown, DelVolpe, and Pappas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| But the pass is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| 12B is an ordinance amending Chapter 16, Article 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Section 16-401 through 16-421 and 6-447 to dissolve the solicitations board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| and to require charitable solicitors to have only proof of state registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| I'd like to make an amendment to the motion to approve on an emergency basis, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| On an emergency basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| What's the emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| And then have an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| The reason why we're asking for this on emergency is just because if it goes on for two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| weeks, there are people who then they have, they would, non-profits would have to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| and apply because their time would be up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| They'd have to put their $25 in, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| So it's just if we're going to do this and there's no reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| If we're going to do it, just do it, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Just do it, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| We have some members of the solicitations board who've been serving faithfully, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| for many years, and I'd like to ask them to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| We have Rob Quillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Please stand, Mr. Quillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| We have Wanda Shenpaugh, who's been the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| She's done a beautiful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| We have Shana Love, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Is Shana there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Shana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| And Jim McSpadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Is Latanya here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Jordan, was she out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Bobby Christenberry, she was here, actually, but not feeling well and went home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| She made the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| I want to thank you all for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Council, you read your AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| You see that since this formed, the state actually does the same thing, but does it all electronically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| and you can do it all via the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| And this is a duplication, really, for nonprofits, so we're streamlining the effort for nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| and found that we don't need to do this ourselves anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| We were the only city doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| And so the group, the solicitations board, worked with us on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| and I think recognized as we brought this to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| And so, actually, I'm asking that they all be willing to serve on another board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| and India will be following up with you to see if there's something else you're interested in serving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3257)|

| 0:54:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| So now we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3274)|

| 0:54:37| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| That's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| That was on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| You all knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Sorry, I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| So now the motion is on the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Now it's passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| So that brings us to public forum, and nobody has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| So we are going to hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Waving a flag there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Someone waving something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Do you want to speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| We will hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| And as you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I'm Lincoln Lincoln, 201 Locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| I might go a tad over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| I hope I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Well, you can't, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| I'm going to stop you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| I'm going to give you a warning beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| But if there are any questions, I'd love to answer those, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| I'm here to talk again about trolleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I was here on 4-28 at our last meeting, and the mayor gave me an opportunity to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| her after the council meeting regarding trolley service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| At that point, we were about to embark on a new trolley program, effective on May 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| And I told the mayor I had some very serious concerns about how effective these changes would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| And we've now had four months of trolley service on what we call the rainbow routes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| green, yellow, and orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| And here is the situation at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| The trolleys are now servicing 17 percent fewer people than before the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| In addition, we have increased the route times and running by about 16 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| So we have a pretty serious differential in performance as a result of all the analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| we put into these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| And I've found that to be a considerable concern because I find areas in the city that requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| additional service, that requested new service from the trolleys, and they did this at meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| that CAD conducted over a two-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Few of these people got those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| In fact, some of them got no service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| After they had service, others had services reduced by as much as 100 percent and some 80 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| To me, this explains why we are carrying fewer passengers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| I have reported these issues to the KTA board for the last two months and will do so again on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3430)|
| 0:57:18| This is public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| We should be moving the public with these trolleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| I don't think that the oversight is being taken seriously enough by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| and I request that the council members who are affected by it and have trolleys in their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| and that ride these units, please get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Some of the promises made, for example, were the Summit Towers area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| There are 300 living units there, the most needy people in the city needing transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| An 80 percent reduction in service was achieved by CAD by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| we will provide you with a special stop and a shelter on Summit Hill Drive to get you people back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| to the no-trolley service times and zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| In five months, nothing has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| I get no response from CAD as recently as today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| We need a little bit of help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Again, prepaid, these are the people who need service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| The next issue is the University Commons service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| We have been serving University Commons for two years with free trolley service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| As all of you know, you sat in these very seats, most of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| and approved TIFs in excess of $10 million to build this wonderful complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| We have been driving our trolleys at our expense, bringing our people to them free for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| And now all of a sudden, the developer manager doesn't want our trolleys in his building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| in the garage down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| And I'm having a hard time figuring out why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| They say they're too noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| They pollute too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| They make too much of a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Some of the people on them have been problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| I don't think these problems are that serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| And they're asking to move the trolleys with these wonderful stops in front of the stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| where a lot of disabled people, old people, can easily and safely get to shop and get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| They want to move the stops across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| and they want the city to pay for the shelters in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| We need a little help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| I was a little late tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| I've talked to every store manager in the lower side of that complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| and I've talked to the big box store managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| You have one minute, Mr. Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| And I've talked to their regional marketing and public relations people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| None of these people have a problem with our trolleys delivering our people to that complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| Something's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| I hate to sound like Donald Trump, but something's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| And I'm hoping we can get to the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Again, our people, our trolleys, our money in the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| If they want to take the trolleys out, maybe we should remove the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| In any case, it has been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| These issues are longstanding, and I am concerned about oversight of CAT by the KTA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| Some members of that board sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| I'm not satisfied that that board is making adequate decisions in terms of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| And I want to end the night with a song on a happy note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| I've developed a small ditty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| It's something like, where have all the trolleys gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Long time passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Too many are empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Let's fill them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Okay, council, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161025?start=3639)|
