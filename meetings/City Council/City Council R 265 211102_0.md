| 0:08:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| I would like to make an alternative motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=530)|

| 0:08:53| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| The motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| The motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Can you just repeat the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I would like to make an alternative motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Do you want to have – I guess is it – I'm not hearing a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| The motion's made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| So the reason I want to – why I'm requesting this of my colleagues is there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=545)|
| 0:09:16| items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| And it's not that I have an issue – a large issue with any one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| It's more that there's so many topics that we – or so many items that come in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| of us where it's sort of a package deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| And I think we should be able to look at each issue by paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| This is something that we did with recode, and it was very important with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| There are items that we cannot look at by paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| That would be the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| I think when we do have items that we can divide into paragraphs, we should be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| to – I'd like to encourage the administration to present it to us in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| As a council member, I would like to be more involved with the decision-making at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| I also – in the past, it's come up where we did have a series of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| Most I agreed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Maybe one or two I had issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| And I feel like a vote yes or no is not an accurate vote on that – at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| So that is why I am putting this alternative motion in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Are there any questions or discussion about this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Seeing no questions or discussion on the motion –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Well, I had a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Sorry, I didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Yeah, a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| The first vote would be about whether to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| And then the next step would be to – I guess the proposed – how we divide it would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=651)|
| 0:11:05| from Council Member Singh as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Mr. Law Director or Mr. Frost, does the motion have to contain the exact nature of the division?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=671)|
| 0:11:20| Well, I guess as it's being presented by Council Member Singh, you would vote on each item individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| You know, there was – for sake of argument, there was – I think Helen Ross-McNabb was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| one item, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| So you would vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| You could have a discussion on every single item and then vote on every single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| And, you know, it would just be like – you could vote in favor of it, you could vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| or you could abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| So instead of having one big item on the agenda, you would be separating them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| You'd be dividing the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| So the motion before you – the motion to amend are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| What was the – to divide the question is before you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| And it would be by each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| So that's the motion before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| I don't see any other questions or discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| So all those in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| You're opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I think the motion fails 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Moving back to the original motion, which is to approve item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| Are there any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| And I'm going to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Motion carries 7-1-no and 1-abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=779)|

| 0:13:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Just for those in our audience and those who are watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| could we have someone to just give a brief overview of what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| actually means, what we're voting on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| for those that have not read the information in the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| I mean, it's the, you know, Mr. Brace, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| I mean, it's the redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| but there's no changes because we got the results of the 2020 census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| and they did not require changes to the boundaries as they're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| drawn, and so it's maintaining the district boundaries exactly as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| That's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=838)|

| 0:14:13| I was just going to say it is important to note that the city grew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| but no district grew in excess or less than needed in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=856)|

| 0:14:56| I would also just point out that this is the fourth one of these I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=896)|

| 0:22:57| Yes, we're selling this property through our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| The plan the owner has for it is to build a single-family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1381)|

| 0:23:10| And did I notice that there are stipulations in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| that the grantee will not move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1396)|

| 0:23:35| that the property does become an affordable rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Yes, with all of our Homemakers Program sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| when we sell a property through Homemakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| the buyer is required to start construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| and complete construction within a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Or the city can take the property back from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| and then put it back in the Homemakers Program for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| So it guarantees that the property will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| In general, it guarantees that the property will be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| but not necessarily that it'll be developed as an affordable rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| Well, it will be developed as affordable rental from this buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| If that falls through, it goes back into the Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| and we take applications again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1468)|

| 0:26:20| And then I moved my family back at the first opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| because, well, Knoxville is home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| This community is passionate and caring and supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| And that's exactly why my father and I began our company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| to give more families a place in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1590)|

| 0:27:02| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| is Janine Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Ms. Johnson, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1635)|
| 0:27:25| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| My name is Janine Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| My address is 119 East Young High Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| I am coming here tonight to speak in favor of InSkip Flats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| because I'm also a native of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| And it's a beautiful, beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| I believe it's the diamond of the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| And I'm also the housing director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| for Kinect Ministries, a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And I help clients and residents in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| find housing daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| And unfortunately, what I have experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| is people are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| They want to become a part, an active part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| And they have trouble finding somewhere to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| And they need affordable housing in order to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| So I'm in favor of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| because I've worked with other property management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| companies and landlords in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| to help residents get affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| We have a program that helps with their security deposits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and we help with wraparound services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| And so I believe when providing affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| in the city, that we can help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| become active members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| and make it a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| So I'm in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you for giving me this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you, Ms. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| is Margaret Bickley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| Ms. Bickley, if you could state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1745)|
| 0:29:05| I'm Margaret Bickley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| I live at 5408 Pinecrest Road, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| And I support this resolution for Nskip Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| My wife and I own our home off Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| adjacent to the Nskip neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| And I'm concerned about the increasing number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| of houseless people I see walking our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I say houseless because Knoxville is their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| just as it's yours and mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| But they're without affordable, safe housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| I see many people walking our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| with their backpacks and carts and possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| all their worldly possessions in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| In the past few years, as Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| we have grown accustomed to seeing camps along Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| and Fifth Avenue and Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Now, though, I'm seeing more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| with backpacks walking Cedar Lane and Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| And I see evidence of homeless camps off Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| just north of I-640, off Merchant Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and even, I think, off Callahan Road most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| And we know that some people are having to call cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| their home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| As more safe and affordable housing, like Nskip Flats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| is built in all parts of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| we will see the number of folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| are having to camp either outdoors in the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| or in their cars decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| And that will improve the community living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| standards for all of us and improve the desirability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| of living in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| So again, I support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| And I ask that you support it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Council members, I'm now going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| to the first three people who signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| in opposition to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| The first person to sign up to speak against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| is Rebecca Cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Ms. Cheek, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| You could come to the podium and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1861)|
| 0:31:18| My name is Rebecca Cheek, and I'm a current resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| at 4725 Royal Prince Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I am concerned with the development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| at 4755 Romeo Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| This is a very narrow lot located directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| behind my house, my condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| The plans are to build five three-story buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| with four apartments on each level, a resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| center, and a laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| When you add roads, parking spaces, and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| it will be crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I realize that an eight-foot privacy fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| is going to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| However, with a third story, I doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| there will be any privacy for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Added traffic on NSYP Road is also a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| There are already frequent accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and it will only get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| If you have not visited or inspected this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I request that you do so before approving this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| As a resident of the NSKIPP community, I oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Next person to sign up to speak in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| is Miss Mary Christopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Miss Christopher, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1948)|
| 0:32:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1959)|
| 0:32:39| My name is Mary Christopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I live at 4706 Royal Prince Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| I am opposed to this project because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| no sidewalks to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| I think that will be a huge problem because we have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and three bedrooms going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| I'm opposed because of the water issues on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| The existing lot is much higher than our condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| We have water standing back there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| I think that's going to be a huge problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| even though I know they said they will fix drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| but I don't see how that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| I think the traffic issues is huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| because we have accidents over there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| I am opposed to having a laundry room that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| open 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| We have some drug issues going on in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| and surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| And I think that will just hinder and help, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| people who want to go in there and have whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| going on 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And I see there's no privacy to the existing condos that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| With that tall of a building and just an eight foot fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I don't see how that's going to be any privacy at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| I think there's probably a better lot in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| for the use of $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| I know we need affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| I am not opposed to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I think we need it, but I just think that lot is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And I oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Next person signed up to speak in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| is Rachel Krieger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Ms. Krieger, you can come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Well, I think there was actually a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| because when I asked what number we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| were on the list for the Kingwood, I was told 11i.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| And looking closer at this, it's actually 12c, d, and e| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| that the three of us are here to speak in opposition on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| So I apologize to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| That's you and Ms. Dyer and Maureen Woolley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| We'll change that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| OK, that concludes public forum for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Was there someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I'm sorry, there was a fourth person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| who signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Council members, you usually have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| Your rules say three in favor and three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| So that means this will conclude public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| for this agenda item, unless you want to suspend your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| OK, that concludes the public comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| You guys have any questions or discussion on this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Yes, this is, in some ways, a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| If you take all the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| the information that we receive from the people opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| is valid information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| These are valid concerns about traffic, density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| the design of the project, and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| And I have a lot of sympathy for that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| But to clarify things, what council is here to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| is not the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| It's just whether or not we will approve an amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| to make these developments affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| So that's the issue that we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Personally, I think that R and 5 is too dense for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| But that has already been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| So what we have to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| If you could speak a little more loudly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| So what we're left with is trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| to make this project as good as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| We've had a lot of discussions with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| They've met with the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| And many of the residents met with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| as well to try to make improvements in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| This property is going to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| in multi-use housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Voting this agenda item down on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| it's going to be funded as far as the affordable housing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| is not going to stop an apartment from being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| And whatever comes in there will be zoned R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| So theoretically, if this particular developer did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| go forward, someone else could come in and make a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| that was not as compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| One instance, I could cite several different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| But actually, the developer is proposing 66 planned units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| R and 5 allows 79 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| So the developer is actually building with less density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| than he's required to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| So if this was a zoning issue, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| would be having a much different conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| So what we've got to do is work as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| with the property zoned as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| And after doing a lot of work and talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| to a lot of the neighbors and going to associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| meetings, I'm convinced that this proposal that's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| is as good as we're going to get as far as what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| going to be in harmony with that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| considering how it's zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And any other project that comes in, or if this falls through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| and this applicant decides to alter the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| then it could be even more dense with less of the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| So I'm in favor of going ahead with this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2315)|
| 0:38:45| I think the affordable aspect of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| is something we've all been working for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So I would ask for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| I'll reiterate the sentiments of my colleague, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Thomas, in the sense that these issues are never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| taken lightly in the concerns of neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| But to that end, I will say we have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| numerous emails in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| And for me, that's been rather refreshing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| for residents of this community to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| the need of housing and affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| And again, it goes back to, I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| say we need housing at all levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| at fair market, at affordable, at lower income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| And I think this meets the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| and it goes back to housing for our first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| our teachers, our nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| And it's something that we critically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| need in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| And again, it's never easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| There are always going to be concerns and gives and takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| But we've also been charged with other developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| from this particular developer, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| has been very conscientious across this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| to develop affordable housing and to really keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| the integrity of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| and the concerns of the neighbors in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| So I feel like this is a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| And when you have a developer who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| willing to work with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| I think that's a win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Yes, I have a question for Mr. Varner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| So while you're making your way to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| I'll start my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Are you just developing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| or will you also be managing the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| We are just developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| It will be Emerald Housing Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| They specialize in affordable apartment management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| so they will be handling the management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Do they manage something else here in town currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| They have five or six other similar properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| and they are also going to be managing Burlington Commons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| which will be coming online in the next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| And then the Ammons and Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| which was discussed, I guess, about six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| they will also be managing those apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| OK, so in terms of specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| like one of the concerns that was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| was access to a laundry room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| And I latched onto that, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| a question for Emerald Housing and how they manage those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| I just want to acknowledge that that is being a valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| That came up with a property in my district recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| and the property management made some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| to alleviate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| So it's coded and managed better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| because people who didn't live at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| were getting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| So they've taken some measures to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| that it's managed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| And that's absolutely something we're willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Any feedback that you all have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| we're more than happy to bring that up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| And we want this to be successful for all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| So if there's something that other groups have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| that was really successful for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| we're more than happy to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| into this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| OK, so yeah, I mean, just making sure that it's secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2542)|
| 0:42:22| To the residents and not to people who might stop by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| is particularly of issue to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| who live there plus people who live nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Yes, Mr. Varner, I've already mentioned the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| that you're actually building less units than you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| could on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| I think maybe 13 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| So it's not as dense as the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| would allow you to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| If you would, and you and I have talked about the validity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| which I think that the neighbors have as far as traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| and green space and the livability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| both for your residents and of the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| can you talk a little bit about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| that you went through as far as talking to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and going to meetings and incorporating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| some of their suggestions in your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Yeah, so as part of the process for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| applying for the Affordable Development Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| we held, I believe the requirements are one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So we held our first meeting back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And we met with the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| And there were several questions that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| from that first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| And so they asked if we could have a second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| So we sat down and had a second meeting also in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| and kind of discussed all of these various aspects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| came up from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| And they also, after that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| sent a list to us of all the different questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| they had identified, some being traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| One was an impact on schools, the privacy fence, green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| questions like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| And we actually put together a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| that answered all those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| and then was dispersed to the neighborhood group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| to hopefully try and put all those things in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| so people could reference them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| if they had any specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you, Mr. Varner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Any further questions or comments from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2657)|

| 0:46:12| Good evening, Mayor, Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| My name is Patrick Smith with Van Smith Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2773)|

| 0:46:21| The request for Rn4 zoning came down to one issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| It was able to construct triplex townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| on a 9,000-square-foot lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| versus the required 12,000-square-foot lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| in the Rn3 zoning category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| We discussed with staff at length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| the option of developing a townhome product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| under the Rn3 category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| but after utilizing the dimensional control for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| it was evident that the existing topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| there's a large drainage swell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| on the back two-thirds of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Some of y'all have seen it, some of y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And the existing width would not allow the depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| or width of the lots to be platted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| and comply with the larger dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| control requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| We then requested staff review the Rn4 option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| and they concurred that the Rn4 category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| would still be consistent with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| as a transitional use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| In your packet, you'll see there's currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Rn4, Rn5 development adjacent to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| as well as two or three commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| We understand that the opposition to this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| is mostly founded in Rn4 having a multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| However, we have no intent of constructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| multifamily development project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And the reality is that to construct such a product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| would require hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| to mitigate the drainage swell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| conveyance structures and existing topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| We also have support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| I think Ms. Ryder can let you know that there are emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| that she did receive some emails in support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| The property is not zoned vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| and the current permitted uses in the Rn2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| include single family, duplex, bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| community center, daycare home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| manufactured housing and educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Our desire has always been to develop a for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| residential property development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| that encourages home ownership and neighborhood inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| We feel that the site is best served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| as a residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| and it'll incorporate medium family density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| townhome product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| They'll provide additional product types to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| including paved driveways, parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| public sidewalks, themed landscaping and fenced yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| This is contrary to the many single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| in that neighborhood, which I would define as Cedar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| the Fenwood, Astor to Kingwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| That's kind of what we feel like our neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| They're being converted to duplexes and triplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| single family homes in short term rental units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| in the neighborhood today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| We actually did, I actually drove around with the postman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| and counted up how many units were in that block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| 160 houses, 160 structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| About 40 of them are being used as rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Of those 40, they consist of about 60 some units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| So there are rental units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| and there are multifamily units in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| We don't wanna build a rental unit, that's not our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Our goal is to provide or build a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| with triplexes that will be for sale real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Our opposition has notified us during public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| and being the MPC or the community meeting we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| that their fear is that their home values will fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| I don't believe that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I believe their marketability of existing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| in the neighborhood may decline during construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| and sales of townhomes or any new product that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| They had an issue with safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Through the development of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| there'll be sidewalks and fences built along Kingwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| and Balsam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Traffic, they had an issue with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| The reality is a single family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| if you look at, I don't know if city engineering's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| but if you look at IT codes for single family development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| you know, they generate 10 trips per day, sometimes 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| A townhome will generate six to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Compatibility, we walk around the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| and take pictures of everyone's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| and we mash them together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| how do we build a triplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| out of these three great products and all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| So that is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| Drainage, they said it'll cause flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Well, any development in there is going to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| a little bit of flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| but what we're talking about is a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| it's 1.7 acres, only 0.6 of it is developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| I can put Platt, without coming to y'all today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| five single family homes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and we're asking for the ability to do six townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| two triplexes, and maybe a single family home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| And on the drainage perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| this drainage ditch is 20 feet deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| it's fed by a 36 inch concrete culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| So the most it could ever fill up is three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| If there's drainage downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| I've reached out to city engineering and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| you're more than welcome to some of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| in the back there, if you guys wanna put a weir structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| or some type of drainage conveyance structure back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| no problem, had the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| with Ms. Ryder about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| So with that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| we don't think there's gonna be a great impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And we would ask for favorable consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| to the request as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Okay, the first person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| in opposition to this is Rachel Krieger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Ms. Krieger, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| My name is Rachel Krieger, 2523 Fenwood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I'm here to speak on behalf of those in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| I kindly ask those in opposition to stand with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| In addition to those unable to be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| other residents listed on the signature pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| that were passed out to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| They live within a very close radius of Kingwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| We ask you to deny the requested changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| to the one-year plan, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| the subsequent rezoning of Kingwood Drive, or road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| Neighbors did reach out to the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| and scheduled a meeting to learn more about the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| That request has changed consistently over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| We've reached out to them again to try to rediscuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| and that has gone unheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| The request fails to meet the legally required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| standards for the requested plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| There are no substantially changed conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3156)|

| 0:52:41| There are no errors or omissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| that warrant a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| There are no durable land use changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Though planned, there's not currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| an accelerated bus corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| and the CAT bus 22 route into Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| has not yet changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Bus routes can be changed and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| There are no durable land use changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3179)|

| 0:53:31| it is noted on page one of the plan amendment report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3211)|

| 0:54:06| We will lose our existing affordable, modest homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3246)|

| 0:56:24| My name is Ruth Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| I live at 414 Balsam Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| My home sits at the corner of Kingswood Road in Balsam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| with the front door facing the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| across the dead end portion of Balsam Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| I fell in love with this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| and while searching for a home to raise my son in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| he's currently 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| The pictures of this house and property were amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| and did not do the house justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| My home was built in 1900, so it is 121 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| It's been added to over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| but the home's integrity has been kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| through the different remodels as it needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| It is my understanding from the lady whom I bought the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| that her grandmother grew up in the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| and was married to her grandfather in the front parlor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| which really was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| um, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| I love that this home has a tradition of family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| and I want to conserve that tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| and pass it down to my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Happy homes are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Over the past two years, I have met many of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| and feel comfortable walking to their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| talking to them when I see them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| or just waving as we pass by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Rita Clore, who lives on the road behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| on Midlake Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| shares the abundance of her gardens with her neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| She's brought peppers, tomatoes, squash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| even brought homemade salsa over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Mary Lee Bohannon and I were in the course of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| in the course of our conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| discovered that I grew up in the same small church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| where her father was a member in another part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| So we kind of pulled this back together into a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| although it's a different community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| than where this was originally at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| as far as the relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| I work for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I've taught for nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I had taught for nine years at Southville High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| before accepting a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| as a school counselor at Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| I've been in this school for the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| School counselors are paid on a teacher pay scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| and required to have a master's degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| which I'm still paying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| It takes approximately a third of my take-home pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| to pay my mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Due to the amount of the home, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| due to the age of the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| it requires constant upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3522)|
| 0:58:42| and I'm lucky that it was in great condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| when I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| But this does add extra expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| which I was aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Currently, I'm refinancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| due to the lower interest rates available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| and my loan officer has advised me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| that my property in the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| has went up $95,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| which for me is very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| He stated that he expects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| based on the neighborhood, the upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| and the long-term housing that's been in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| I guess the continuance of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| that he expects the value to increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| not to fall back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| Many of my neighbors have bought homes in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| and restored them and moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Our neighborhood is part of the original Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| It is historical, provides homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| for many middle-class families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Our homes are a reflection of ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| and the area we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| I enjoy being able to walk down the road to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Myself and my neighbors walk their dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| or just walk for exercise on Balsam and Kingwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| The traffic is already heavy at certain times of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| and many students in the afternoons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| can be seen walking home from Gresham Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| because it's in the one-mile walking zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| around the school, this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| This area is, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| Kingswood and Balsam do not have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| In fact, Holbrook Road has a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| but it only comes down to the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| where Kingswood's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3614)|
| 1:00:14| It doesn't go past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| So it just covers the property in front of the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| and the DAV in that area and then stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| so that we go into that low-density neighborhood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| We enjoy our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| as it allows us the freedom to enjoy each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| and the life that we're building there in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3634)|

| 1:00:39| Next person signed up to speak is Marin Woolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| You can state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Good evening, Marin Woolley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| 2600 Fenwood Drive, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| My family bought our home on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| of Fenwood and Kingwood in March of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| We were seeking a home with historical charm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| in a neighborhood which had a true suburb feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| quiet and low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| We found our home on one of Fountain City's original streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| and it does have that beautiful suburb feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| even though it's centrally located in the heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| the true beginning of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| We chose to put our investment in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| though it was declining years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| because of the historical beauty it held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| as well as our belief that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| was revitalizing and it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| We have become part of our community of homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| and long-term renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| In fact, my immediate neighbors have been renting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| The group here with me today and many others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| who are unable to attend due to their valuable commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| to their jobs, families and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| are in passion group who care about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| our neighborhood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| We chose this community for its selling points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| It's centrally located, it's historical charm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| it's beautiful, quiet streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| and it's low density home designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| The amazing neighbors and community we've built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| around these traits is just a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Only two years ago, the city voted that our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| should remain under the low density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| Patrick Smith has only just moved to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| in April, 2020, a mere year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| He has moved here for what seems to be the sole purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| of constructing much higher density buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| which is why he has requested this zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| This person has not become part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| He appears to be here to make his profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| with no concern for his neighbors, us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| the people who chose this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| for the beautiful qualities for which it possesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| If the new zoning is approved, our neighborhood will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| The current low density zoning in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| has higher density zoning on the outskirts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| but our neighborhood gem is truly tucked away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| from the hustle and bustle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| We don't have the worries of greater traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| and our non-sidewalk streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| would be more challenging to traverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| if the higher traffic did come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| And noise pollution as well will come with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| We enjoy living in our affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| well-established historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| I and my neighbors are opposed to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Please help us to preserve our low density neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| and maintain the barrier that allows our beautiful traits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| of the community to shine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Thank you, mayor and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Council members, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Yeah, so this particular agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| as everyone well knows, has been postponed several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| And I appreciate everyone's patience in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I know that sometimes that was frustrating to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| because it was last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| I will say the last one was more on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| as a personal family issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| but I was very amenable to Mr. Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| willingness to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I want to state a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Some of them may be redundant that have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| The postponements have allowed time for me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| I've had conversations with Ms. Crager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| I hope I pronounced that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| and Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| I have not spoken or heard from other neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| other than I've seen the petition that was turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| I will comment that one of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| at least one of the addresses on the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| the property, I'm assuming it's a renter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| that signed the petition because the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| is one of the people abutting the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| that contacted me that said they were in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| So there are people who have contacted me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| several property owners in the area that were in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| I had lengthy discussions with both planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| and the applicant, as well as some of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| about the different zoning and what the zoning allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| There's a couple of different options on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Obviously there's the option to approve or deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| the RN-4 that passed through the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| And then another discussion was to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| to the planning commission for consideration of RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| That was discussed at the pre-agenda meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| but not at the actual planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| So it is not part of the public record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| and therefore not something that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| make a motion on and pass tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| This piece of property is incredibly challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| It's 1.7 total acres, and I believe Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| said about .6 acres of it is buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| I think it's a little less than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| that's actually buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And he has stated that it would cost thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| or hundreds of thousands of dollars to remediate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| I've had conversations with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| I think it would be quite substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| to be able to build on the full piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| So you end up with this tiny piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| and some of the concerns from other property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| are that it's used to dump trash on and brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| and is unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| I also think it's kind of dangerous with a 20-foot ravine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| that's unrestricted on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| And it's been like that for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Anyway, regardless, the usable piece of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| as it currently sits with the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| would allow about five houses to be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| With R and three or R and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| you would still be limited to about seven developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| So the difference in as it sits right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| versus changing the zoning is two, two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| Because the limiting factor is the street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| because the back part of the property is unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And then also, Mr. Cannon, correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| if I say this incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| I believe it requires a riparian zone around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| it's like a 30-foot buffer riparian zone around the ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| Dimensionally, you're in the ballpark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| but that is correct, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Yeah, but riparian zone, did I say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| So basically what we're debating here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| is the difference between five and seven units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| The property on one side is surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| by a commercially used building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| It's R and four zoned on Holbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| And it's R and four zoned on the backside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| So this is kind of this transitional vacant piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| that's ended up having a lot of dumping on it over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| including landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| The difference in height, minimum width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| and setbacks and impervious does not change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| between R and three and R and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| So that's not what we're looking at in difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| The big difference, when Mr. Smith met with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| at the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| they were pushing towards R and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| but the difference is being able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| the three attached units and the space in between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| is minimal, but makes it slightly more feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| in R and four versus R and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| So we have three things to vote on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| We have the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Some of the discussion is about the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| and the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4091)|
| 1:08:11| So I'd like to ask Ms. Brooks to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| on the rationale for the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| because there are four criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| for a sector plan or a one-year plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| And some of them were not used in the staff opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| And that was one of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| as to why they weren't used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| So the Amy Brooks Knoxville, Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| So in the, for the one-year plan and the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| there are several conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| that warrant an amendment to the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| and they meet, may meet any one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| So it's different than a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| where it must meet all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| So it just needs to meet at least one of those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| And the one of the ones that was identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| was a public improvement that was, was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| So this is pretty typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Usually what we see are significant road investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| but in this case, the one that was highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| was the accelerated bus corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| And I understand that project has, has changed over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| but there are still significant plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| for CAT along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| And the project has been adjusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| since it was originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| But it's still slated to include bus stop amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| signal prioritization, Q jumps for CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| And it is part of the transportation planning organization's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| transportation improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| And it is a fairly significant investment of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| I'm sure maybe director Cannon might know the exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| but it's in the ballpark, about $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Can you comment on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| can you read us the other two or three reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| for a sector plan change that were not cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Yes, so a change in public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| unanticipated by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| New information, including new plans and studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| produced by Knox County Planning becoming available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| which reveals the need for a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| or error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| Is there not, those are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| those are three that you just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Yes, and the one that I just read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| was a significant change in the development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| or completion of a public improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| road, park, sewer, which changes the basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| on which the plan was developed for an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| Well, I'm particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| I've had a lot of struggle with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I wanna state, there was a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| between the different parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| the folks who, all of which live in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| the applicant as well as the people in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Everyone lives in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| I've met with them together, which was bumpy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| I think is a fair way to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| And I've met with them individually as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| or spoken with them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| And what's interesting to me is you all live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| in single family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| and you all bring up the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| You all talk about walkability and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| and getting to and from school and having walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| And I will say that some of the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| one of the postponements that occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| was where Mr. Smith was having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| about greenway connectivity through this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| potentially on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| because the city actually owns property on either end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| and this property connects through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| And so that's what led to one of the postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| And so what I wanna say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| though you all seem in very opposition to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| you actually all have the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| about your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| You may disagree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| but I've met you each individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| and you all have the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| And you all live in single family housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| And I struggle with this particular zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| because I was leaning towards R and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| because you end up getting the same number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| with R and 3 or R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| But to go with R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| you end up opening the door to multi-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| And that's where I have some hesitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| to that particular zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| And I think the R and 3 makes it a very good transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| between the R and 4 that already surrounds the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| on two sides and then transitions to the R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| that are on the other two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| So that is where I'm struggling with this particular zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| That is where I'm struggling with making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| because that adds more time to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| So I am going to turn off my light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| and see if my colleagues have any comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| Yes, I have some problems with the R and 4 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| I think the neighbors very well stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| kind of the situation that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| As the applicant said, as the current zoning is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| he's not going to be forbidden from developing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| He could build five single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| with the zoning as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| And to me, that seems more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| with what is there at the now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| The density would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Property values are going to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| You know, we're going to increase the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| And, you know, generally I'm for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| People need places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| But we don't need it when it starts having a negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| on people who already live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| And I'm afraid R and 4 is too dense for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| I'm afraid that if we do go up to that high level of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| then this neighborhood is actually going to be diminished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| in its quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| And anybody that knows me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| knows I'm not a purist on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| You have to balance things out as far as growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| and giving people places to live, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| But in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| I don't feel comfortable going up to R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| especially if it's not depriving the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| of the opportunity actually to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| It's just not going to be at the level he might like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| But I think it's much more harmonious with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| So I am pretty much inclined to oppose the R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| I might, if it goes for consideration on R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| that's another discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| But I don't think that I feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| approving an R and 4 on this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| I have a question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| Because obviously townhomes are allowed in R and 3 and R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| but rental units versus owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| can you help distinguish between those two zoning codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| and the ability or inability to either rent or own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| within the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Council Member, the zoning code doesn't address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| the issue of ownership versus renting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| That's not something that the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| contemplates specifically of how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| in terms of if someone wanted to build townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| they could put them in a condo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| they could condo them and they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| sell them off individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| In either zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| But it's really the square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| allowed in the zoning for those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| or single family versus multi-family or townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4563)|
| 1:16:11| Are you asking what the difference is in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| what's allowed specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| I can pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| Council Member Testerman, did you have more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| or we can come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| We can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Okay, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| I'm gonna pass, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Okay, Council Member Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| I wanna hear some more of my colleagues before I leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| I wanna say that I really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| hearing from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| and the meetings that have gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| with your council representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| You know, council has always had this tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| of trying to bring everyone together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| and have discussions about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| And so I think that's a critical piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| to what council does and I wanna applaud all those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| I have been in some of those meetings too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| and they have been sometimes more heated than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| So I understand how that can go sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I'm certainly hearing some very valid concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| from the neighbors about what's going on with RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| versus what's going on in RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I also have to commend my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| for talking as well about affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| and places for folks to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| because that's another struggle we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| and that's kind of where we find ourselves tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| I certainly would like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Planning Commission's thoughts on RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| and it doesn't sound like that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So I would concur with my colleague, Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| and as well as Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| about the possibility of RN3 being a good compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| That's all, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| Ms. Brooks, did you have anything that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| was that a question or just like a rhetorical state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| Okay, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Okay, I'll ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| What is the difference between RN3 and RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| and why was that not discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| or what is the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Because it seems subtle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| and I want to understand why we didn't talk about RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| So the applicant requested RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| and I would defer to him to speak specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| to their preference for how they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| to sell those individual units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| But I can tell you, so RN3, townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| for the first three townhomes that you build in the RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| you need a minimum of 12,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| and then each subsequent one, you can have 3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| they can, you can count 3,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| for each additional dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| The RN4, it shifts to just the requirement for townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| for 3,000 square foot per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| So you're not restricted to the first three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| you're having a minimum of 4,000 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| I know it's a little nuanced and probably not quite clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Well, that's why I want you to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| because I keep hearing RN3 discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| I think we need to understand what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| And I understand that wasn't your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| it was what the applicant wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| I will just also point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| that RN3 does not allow multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| That's another distinction between the RN3 and RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| So townhomes would not be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Townhomes are allowed in both of those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| but a small scale multifamily building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| would not be allowed in RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| and it would be allowed in RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| So, I'm not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| A townhome is not considered multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4799)|
| 1:19:59| A townhome is not considered multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| We don't typically refer to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| like a multifamily would be stacked units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| like a five, six, 12, 18 unit building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| something along those lines, or larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| So a 25 unit townhome is not multifamily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4813)|
| 1:20:21| We don't refer to that as multifamily in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| We refer to it as a distinction between...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Okay, so it's only stacked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Yeah, so townhomes are not stacked units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| I imagine the average person doesn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Well, Mr. Frost, can you point out the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| in permitted versus uses between the two zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| RN3 and RN4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| I have it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Briefly, RN3 is intended to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| medium density residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| characterized by one and two family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| Townhouse dwellings may be allowed by special use approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| to facilitate a more urban development form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| Limited non-residential uses that are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| with the character of the district may also be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| RN4 is intended to accommodate mixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| medium density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| Single family, two family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| and townhouse dwelling residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| is permitted with low rise multifamily dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| and new development forms such as pocket neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| allowed by review and in some cases special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| It's RN4 is intended to be applied to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| that are characterized by such mixed residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| use development or have been identified in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| where such development would be suitable in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| So Director Brooks can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| In RN4, a townhouse is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| However, in an RN3, townhouse is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| goes through the special use process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| That is correct, Mr. Frost, but in the RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| anything over eight townhomes would require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| would also kick into the special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| which would go before the planning commission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Right, I just don't think the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| the buildable part of the property won't accommodate eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| so it never would get to the triggering of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| So Ms. Brooks, if there's a motion to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| for consideration of RN3, that's additional meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| and then there would be a meeting to review special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| If once a plan was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| That's correct, it was approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| If they wanted a townhome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| but if they wanted to do single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| there's no review in RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| Or duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Or duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Council Member Parker and then Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| I wanted to ask the developer to come back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| just to restate, not your full five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| but at the beginning of your public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| you were outlining your reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| for this particular zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| Mr. Smith, could you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| If you could just repeat for us your reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| for wanting the R4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| and if you don't mind speaking to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| you could move forward with the development under an R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| I'm sorry, could you restate that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| If you could move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5034)|
| 1:23:54| with your current development plans under R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| Yeah, so the reasoning we request at R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| we looked at R3, we did the dimensional control on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| with respects to just the width of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| and the depth before you get to the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| So the 12,000 square feet, as cited by Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| would not allow us to put two triplexes along Kingwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| We actually got too big and too wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| So on R3, I'd have to submit a waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| or a variance to the 12,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Would it be granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| So we looked at R4, the dimensional requirements for R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| for a triplex allowed us to put those three units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| on 9,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Mr. Smith, can you bend the mic closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Oh, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| So that allowed us to put the two units along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| the two triplexes along Kingwood almost exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| And that was the reasoning for R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| We had talked with staff about R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Initially they said, hey, R3 is gonna work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Let's work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Then we actually got the plat and the property done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| and the final plat and the property separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| And we're smart people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| We put a scale to it and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| hey, this isn't gonna work with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| without us doing extra deep lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| And the back of these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| would just end up in the drainage swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Well, no one wants that in their back of the lot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Because you have the riparian area back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| You have a huge drainage swale and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| So we went back and forth with staff and it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| well, this is still within the transitional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| you know, the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| The uses of the property to the north of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| is a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| It's the DAV building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| The uses to the east of us are Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| The uses to the north of us across the DAV are Rn5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| The uses to the south of us is Rn2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| And I might state, we live 400 feet from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| We walk by it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| We thought this was just gonna be relatively easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| with respects to we're gonna build a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| we're gonna have a themed landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| we're gonna have the six units that we want up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| maybe a single family unit tucked behind it along Balsam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And this just makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| And staff kind of agreed with us with respects to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| this is a good place for us to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| you know, regarding developing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| That's why we went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| We didn't push for anything Rn4 or Rn3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| We just had conversations with Michelle, city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| and I believe it was Mark, the other gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| I can't remember his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| But we had several conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| several being eight, nine, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| And we sketched up lots on our plat and submitted them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| and said, hey, let's talk about this tomorrow at two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| We have no intentions of building multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| They're multifamily in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| again, to do anything multifamily in that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| you'd have to spend millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| hundreds of thousands of dollars filling in the ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| And you probably wouldn't get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| because the Tennessee Department of Environmental Quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| wouldn't let you fill in that stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| or push the culvert through, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| So we weren't gonna do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| And the 0.5, I'm a little optimistic, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| I said, 0.6, I don't know what it is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| We'll figure it out when time comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| what the exact acreage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| But the 0.5, 0.6 acres we have up there, that's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| I mean, who's going to build a multifamily project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| on that type of acreage of any value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| by the time you do the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| the land use theme setbacks and the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| and everything that you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| with a multifamily dwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| to make it compatible with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| and something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| You wouldn't have a multifamily building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| You'd have four units on top of four units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| on top of four units, on top of four units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| on top of four units, whatever, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| But the parking gets bigger, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| So what we thought would be relatively easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| is just ask for the RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| We're restricted to no get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| with respects to topography and depth on the back of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| We're restricted on three sides by roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| or two sides by roadways, one by DAV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| the existing DAV building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| This just made sense for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| That does sound like my question, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Thank you, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| So Mr. Frost did one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| You could speak a little bit in your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Mr. Frost did clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| So going to RN3 would require special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| variance requests, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| Would you be able, just hypothetically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| be able to subdivide this lot and sell them off as parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| It's your question, would we be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| to subdivide the townhome lots if they was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Correct, I mean the current property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| I would be able to subdivide it right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| into five single family lots and sell them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5311)|
| 1:28:31| And then nobody would have control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| You know, again, one of the issues they had up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| that opposition was giving is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| you're gonna make rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| Right across the street they built a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| they built, please, they built a 750, 800 square foot house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| that's just a rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| It's 40 feet by, or it's 26 feet wide by 40 feet long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| That's not what we desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| We want to build something that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| is nice, compatible with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| as far as architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| We will build streets, off street parking, a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| You drive around our neighborhood now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| again, I live 400 feet from this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I have the only sidewalk along Holbrook along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| You drive around the neighborhood now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| half the time you can't get down a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| because people are parked in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| So right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5357)|
| 1:29:17| The ditches aren't mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Right, so right now, five single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| but you're proposing six townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| potentially one single family, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Whatever it would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Again, I'm 0.6 acres, Ms. Ryder's 0.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| So it's very, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| if you talk about the traffic concerns and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| townhomes, I don't know where the city engineer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| or the traffic engineer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| townhomes create less traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| You can't tell me that it's gonna create more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| It's ITE codes that we follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Um, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| I mean, my thing is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| on at least two sides of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I mean, you do have medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| I go back to an earlier comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| that I made on an earlier agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| I mean, it's, we do need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| I think a developer that's willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| to work with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| and keep with the integrity of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| I think is quite valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| So, and I think five units versus six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| maybe seven, there's just not a big discrepancy there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| and provides, provides more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| Yeah, and I just wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| I think this is an important conversation to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| because some of the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| I've had multiple times with Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| was I don't understand the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| in the lot size for a townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| in R and three versus R and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| which I did not realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5446)|
| 1:30:46| until having extended conversations with Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| It jumps from 12,000 square foot minimum lot size to 3000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| And in essence, what R and three is requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| is a 4,000 square foot lot for a townhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| It doesn't make much sense and I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| And so my question that I posed to Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| not to answer tonight or today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| when we discussed it probably for the fourth time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| was help me understand why this is in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| And I just want to say I did pull out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| because obviously, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| I was avoiding doing housework or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| making phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I pulled out all my old recode manuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| and the dimensions never changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| It was the same through the entire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| almost two years of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| And there's no rational explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| why the leap from one to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| So anyway, it makes a nuanced difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| and it makes doing a townhouse in R and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| slightly more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| with this very restricted piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| The only other thing I wanted to clarify with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Mr. Smith, when we initially spoke outside of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| because the first time I ever met you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| was in the meeting in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| was you talked about the ravine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| and what would happen with it, parceling it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| And then Stormwater, when I met with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| said that it cannot be separately parceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| So when you're talking about dividing your lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| and not going back into the ravine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| what is your current thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| on what you're going to do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Because it can't stand alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| It would be platted into a single family lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| and deed restricted the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| So it would belong to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| one house would have that one whole big place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| Wait, that's my thought right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| But again, until we figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| what the dimensional controls we're developing under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| and what type of product that we want to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| we won't know how that's going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| I mean, we could plot it all the way to the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| with the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| That's a conversation for staff and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| regarding how best to plot this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| and how to protect that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| I could deed it back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| Y'all owned it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Well, no, the city said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| They were very clear in Stormwater, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Well, they haven't said no to me, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Well, we can arrange that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| They can tell you directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| And just to your point about the townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| the development of townhomes in Knoxville right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| I've seen development in a lot of different cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| is a lot of garden homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| I'm sorry, they're not townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Townhomes are two-story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| they're that Charleston style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| that some people call them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Brownstones, they're very close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| With the additional dimensional control in the RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| these townhomes, the middle townhome's only 26, 28 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| So the additional dimensional control of the lot area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| that you're gonna put on these townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| goes on the outside two townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| which separates the townhomes by 40, 50 feet, the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| That's not townhome development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| That just looks like two big houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| And that's where I really had the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| and started challenging staff on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| where does this get to with respects to RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| and how do we shrink this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| and make it look like real townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| We want them to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| I'll actually give you a quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| if you just give me 30 seconds, I'll give you a quick step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| Mr. Smith, Council Member Ryder has the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| and you had your opportunity to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| If there's a question for Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| you're free to ask him a question, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| I'm not sure what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| I'll just close up by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| one of the things we talk about is the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| and the lot dimensions in the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| which I discussed with Ms. Brooks today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| is around 15, 1,700 square feet for the lot to 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| And we've got this RN3 where it says 12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| And I just can't figure out why it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| And it's going to, it's more ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| for a normal piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| but then it triggers all these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| additional approvals and meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| So it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| There's no perfect solution here is what I struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| And so anyway, I think Ms. Testerman has her leg on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| Well, I'll just say based on this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| we'll certainly ask Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| to help us understand and examine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| and perhaps bring a recommended change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| But that's not on the board tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| You know, it's not on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Council Member Testerman, did you, are you like, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| All right, Council, there's not a motion on the floor yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| Council Member Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| It sounded to me from the discussion we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| that one of the issues with the RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| was that it might require a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| because of the narrowness of this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| which definitely looks challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| I would ask Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| is one of the standards for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| kind of challenging topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| and narrowness of a particular space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Off the top of my head, yes, that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Mr. Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| So given the challenges that this particular lot might have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| of course, we don't know what would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| but certainly if you're thinking about a challenging lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| that had unique topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| maybe a giant ravine behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| that caused the space that could be developed pretty narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| that it might end up being a reasonable application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Actually, the first standard for grand interference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| mentions topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Thank you, Council Member Roberto and Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| At this point, there's not a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5814)|
| 1:36:54| I'd like to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Okay, motion made to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Further discussion, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| No, taking your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| Okay, the motion on the floor is to approve item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| I think we need a roll call vote, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=5837)|

| 1:42:06| What I'm here today to talk to you all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| is the fact that here we have trade halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| In those official trade halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| they have official U.S. Department of Labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| apprenticeship programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| I don't know if all of you are aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| but those apprenticeship programs give certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| Now, some of you may consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| what is the big deal about being a plumber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| You just take some pipes together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| and you're a pipe fitter, you're a plumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| That is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| If any of you have ever had water problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| or toilet problems or your HVAC doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| you don't want somebody around who can't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| You want somebody who is skilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| The other thing I wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| as far as this apprenticeship program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| is it's not just limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| A lot of people think it's limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Okay, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6198)|

| 1:43:29| They learn supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| And every single one of those apprentices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| get the minimum 10-hour OSHA training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| And when this project is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| when we're done with them on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6222)|
| 1:43:49| they can turn around and go to their union halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| because they have the skills to get another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6233)|
| 1:44:01| The other thing I wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| is the fact that they get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| that they get a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| They get health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| All of their children get health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6256)|
| 1:44:25| They lose their job because I'm a small contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| I lay them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| I can't work them forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| That's why I stayed union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Because when I lay them off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| they don't lose their health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Their sick child still gets the insurance that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| the doctor care that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| And it continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| I just wanted to conclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| that I want you all to seriously take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| Look at your apprenticeship programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| The real apprenticeship programs, let me stress that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| audited apprenticeship programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| And anybody who says you can't afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| I want to tell you that is a load of bunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| because I have got nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| I am certified DBE, certified woman owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| and I haven't received anything from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you, Ms. Ivey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6328)|

| 1:45:34| The next person signed up to speak at public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| is David Creighton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| Mr. Creighton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6337)|
| 1:45:53| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| My name is David Creighton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| I live at 1914 Gleason Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| I'm in the process of moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| so I have to write it down and remember what the address is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| Wow, how do I top that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| I am a representative of the Iron Workers Workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| local here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| And wow, how do I top that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I am a native of Memphis, born and raised in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| so I'm one of the ones that came here and stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| So I've been here since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| I went through the apprenticeship program in Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| for three years, and what a change in my life it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| I went from graduating with no direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| to ups and downs, jobs, dead-end jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| these jobs here, but I got direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| at my down point in time in my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| with a couple Iron Workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| and they directed me to the apprenticeship program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| and they gave me all the skills I needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| to have such a awesome career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| I mean, start from the bottom all the way to the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| to where I could possibly do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| learn how to weld, reprint, like she was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| It's absolutely amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| One thing I wanted to say was our guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| through all that, it brought me to the position I am right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| while I organize guys and bring them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| and show them the ropes and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| but our guys, before they go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| they have to sign something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| what we call is a standard of excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| So that is holding the guys responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| for their actions, their responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| and what they have to do on the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| to the standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| So what we're asking for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| is that Randy Boyd is held to the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| and excellence, and for the guys that go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| everything they say, we have them write down something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| We're asking him to write down something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| If you're gonna do this, write it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| let us sign it, come to agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| that that's what we're gonna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| So that's what we're looking for him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| And also to use apprenticeship programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| to use local labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| I think the last job I worked on here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| was one of our jewels downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| and that's the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| So what a sense of honor and pride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| after building, remodeling the Tennessee Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| to go back in it to a concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| put the money that I've made through contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| What an honor to see all the hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| that the guys worked on in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| as well as the things that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| So that's what we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| is to hold him accountable for his promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| If you're gonna do this, sign it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| put it on paper just like we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| and we're held to your standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| Next person signed up to speak at Public Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| is John Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Mr. Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| If you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| and please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| and you will have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6550)|
| 1:49:17| My name is John Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| I live at 5514 Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| The reason I'm here is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| we're trying to get our road fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| It's approximately 60 or 70 years of travel that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| There has been no improvements made on it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| Councilman Sy has been the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| that we have been able to get in touch with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| that has worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| I've invited the mayor and other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| to come to meetings that we have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| She's the only one that has tried to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| The problem with the road is you've got two churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| and three schools in conjunction with this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| You have three subdivisions connected to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| You're trying to build another subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| with 20 to 40, 18 to 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| You can figure 30 or 40 more cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| Traveling this road, it's about a mile and a half long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| And there's been money for everything else in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| but the public safety of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| So what I'm asking is I need somebody to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| I've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| Councilman Sy has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| She has helped us so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| She can only do so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| She needs your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| There has been people run out of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| on this Nickel Road because it is so narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| In one place, it's only 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| You can't get emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| You can't get fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| anything coming through there and make another car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| Somebody has to get in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Most of the places, there are no ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| The city recently purchased a new fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| I saw it on the news last week or this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| I guess it was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| And the reason I know about that truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| is because I met that truck on Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| I'm sure it was a trial run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6691)|

| 1:51:51| I've lived there 46 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Used to, there was not that much traffic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| But now, there's getting to be more and more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| The sides of the road are eroding away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| because of the drainage problems that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| There's no shoulder whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| Some of the drainage ditches are two and three feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| You run in it, you're hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6736)|

| 1:52:30| because the road is so narrow, you cannot pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| I guess what I'm asking for is for some assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| some help from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6760)|

| 1:52:50| not all at one time, not expecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| We're not asking for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| All we want is a road that is safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| for the neighborhood, for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| so we can navigate safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6782)|

| 1:53:12| It takes up the whole road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| And it's dangerous for these kids getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| of the school bus or getting on a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| I guess what I'm asking for is some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211102?start=6801)|
