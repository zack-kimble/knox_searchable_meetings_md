| 0:01:01| All right, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| For the amendments in addition to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| we have several folks who have a time crunch today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| So if it is okay with the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| we're going to change the order a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| Commissioner Daley will go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| and then Commissioner Durrett will come in after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| I'd like to combine nine and ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| I think we're talking about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| So you can just scratch mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| We're in the same ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Thank you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Are we okay with setting the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Approval of the minutes from the previous meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| from December 7th, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Motion to approve by Jay, second by Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Guys, we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Public forum, do we have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Discussion and consideration, any late additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| We don't seem to have any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| We are now at item number six, discussion and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| of including guidelines for commission attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| to prepaid conferences to commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| This would fall under rule six, miscellaneous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| deed outside conferences, and travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Commissioner Haley, would you like to tell us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| about why you brought this to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Yes, I want to thank you, Madam Chair and the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| and other commissioners here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| This is my eighth year, final year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| being to just about every conference that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| In the past, we've had people that commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| and I think other departments, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| because I've seen other departments stare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| at some of these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| that they apply to go to conferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=172)|
| 0:03:00| It costs us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| It costs the taxpayers money for the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| It costs us taxpayers money to spend the night at the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| one or two nights, whatever the maximum or the minimum is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| And I just don't think, I think in our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| we need in the future, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| I should have brought this up long before this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| It's not fair that taxpayers are paying for fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| and rooms for my county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| I'll just say all of my county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| not attending, commit to go to a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| And I understand there may be certain situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| where there's sickness or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| But you've heard me say that if you sign up for a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| you need to meet that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| If you sign up to go to a conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| you need to go to that conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| This committee, I look at it as taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| It could be anywhere from Gatlinburg Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| probably would cost us $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| all the way if you was to go to NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| that could be thousands of dollars, whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| I would like for this rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| to consider some type of a reimbursement policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| or something there that if you sign up to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| you commit to go to a conference, you go to a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| Or you reimburse the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| You commit and she's paid and it's been paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| If you don't go in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| you can get through and cancel a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| But on the last minute notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| and you might name it any day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| but we've had a commissioner that lo and behold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| she signed up for every conference and never showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| It cost the taxpayers a lot of money in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| It's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Do we have any other circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| in which a reimbursement policy for county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| is something that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| I mean, is there another legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| or even a county employee that works in any other department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| that has such a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| I'm not aware of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Is there anything that is legally illegal that we could or could not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| That's going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| I don't see anything to prevent you from doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Is it legally bindable just because it's a rule in commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Well, that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| You would have to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| depend on either the honor of the person to stroke a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| or to withhold from their next paycheck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| whatever the reimbursement amount is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| which means you'd have to work with the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Or we can take it away from their designation funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker had a great idea at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| and he still probably does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| that figure out what the conferences are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| If it's $12,000, each commissioner gets $10,000 or $12,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| and that comes out of that designation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| And if you don't go to that conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| that money's coming out of your designation fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| but it's still accounting for tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| But it's still some type of incentive that you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| So you're saying increase the designation funds is the total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| which might include things that we might support the community with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| including continuing education, which is what the conferences are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| and then the money that's paid out of that or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| Well, I'm not saying that we increase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I'm just saying that was a suggestion in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| and that would be one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Say through what's averaged at $2,500 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| If you don't go to NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| That's a good estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| So if you go $7,500, you've got $2,500 of that to go to the conferences or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| I might make the suggestion we also talk to HR personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| This is just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| No motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| It's just a suggestion that over eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| I've seen a lot of taxpayers' money that should have been spent a lot more wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=467)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| If the body please open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Oh, now you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| I appreciate that in principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| I think it's spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| My concern, and I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| My concern, though, is that where do you get into this business of what's excused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| and what's not excused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Of course, if someone has an unexpected death in the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| or just getting sick is one thing, but there's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| oh, well, I have a work commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Oh, I have a court date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Oh, I have, well, where do we draw that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| That's the difficulty in all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| It is a difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Somebody would have to judge whether you had a good cause for missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| Because like you said, he could have sickness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| but do you have to bring his doctor's note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| I mean, and in a political body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| you may find it difficult to vote that one of your colleagues' excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| is not a good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| So that's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| With these kinds of things, enforcement is always the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| So it would bear some thought about how you go about structuring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Yeah, I agree with what Carson's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| I think where I have a problem is if somebody has signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| to go for a conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| decides a week in advance they're not going to a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| In the meantime, Drew's already paid a registration fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| that is non-refundable at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| But she's also guaranteed hotel rooms for two nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| A week in advance, usually we have to cancel a hotel 24 hours in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| It's actually 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Okay, 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| But just not to say anything to Drew and give her the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| of at least calling the hotel and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| hey, this individual's not coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| and allowing another commissioner from some other county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| to have that opportunity, have that hotel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| It's just crazy because the recent incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| we paid for two nights and nobody showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Well, you might be able to put in our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| that each commissioner that signs up for a conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| is encouraged to attend a conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| because it's usually in cash payers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| So they rule that not necessarily that it would be enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| but it's there to encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| If you sign up, you're very, very encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| And I understand there are some things that may happen or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| If the body's comfortable, I can get with our law department and personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| and just kind of talk through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| and then maybe bring it back to our next meeting for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| If you're comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| I think the way to tie some kind of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| is to just reduce some of your designation funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Because then you have a pool of resources to help your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| or your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| If you ignore something and you don't cancel within a week or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| whatever the hard costs that are eaten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| it's a one budget for us as a commission of an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| That would be an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Maybe not come out of your personal pocketbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| but it would be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| You're not going to have as much to help support your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| So I think that if we can tie it to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| then it stays within the same budget line item or the same budget pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| but it definitely has a little bit of team to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Because then if you bailed on a $25, $100 expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| to go to Washington, D.C. or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| then I'm going to notice it when I need to go get some checks done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| I will work on that, and then I will provide you with a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Don't be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| All right, we're moving on to agenda item number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| discussion and consideration of the commission schedule by Commissioner Durr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| So you should have in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| a somewhat complete line item or red line copy of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| I would propose to our commission schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| And you should also have the current April meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| or April calendar that Driel has put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| What I'm handing out now is a graph at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| It includes what April would look like with these changes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=764)|
| 0:12:56| So what I'm proposing is several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| One is the elimination of our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| And I'll go through the reasoning here momentarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| So we eliminate work session altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| We move our zoning meetings from 7 p.m. on the fourth Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| to 5 p.m. on the third Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| So essentially, our zoning meetings would replace our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| We can add an agenda review meeting to the third Monday at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| or another time, but after the agenda is released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| The agenda would be released at the same time it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| which is the Thursday before the third Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| Beer board can remain the same at the same time, third Monday at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| Our legislative meeting remains on the fourth Monday at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| And I would propose that once the kinks get worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| that the schedule change would begin September 1st for our new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| And the reasoning for this is there are several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| One, when you think about our work session and all of our deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| while it is valid, a majority of the time, I would even say 90-plus percent of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=856)|
| 0:14:26| our motion at work session, whatever we're deliberating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| And so then it goes to our legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Case in point, when we had the utility ordinance and resolution in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| we talked for an hour and three minutes at work session with no resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| to send it forward to our legislative meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| where we again talked about it for an hour and four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| There was a resolution then, so it's just there's a lot of talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| and then we don't make any action at work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Another reason behind it, moving up zoning to 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| allows for those constituents who are involved in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| to be able to get there earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| They can get home earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Also, it avoids a recess of our legislative session when we do have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| that go on and on and on where we have to stop and go into recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| so we can start zoning and then have to go back into commission later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Our county staff, while, yes, they are technically hourly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| that is cutting into their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| We are extending their work time, and so it would avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| It eliminates redundancy at our work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| and at our legislative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| We read drives and roads twice, line-item transfers twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| budget amendments twice, spread of record twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| And ordinances, when they're on their first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| they get read at work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| We move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| I mean, it's just they're technically being read four times instead of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| They have four readings instead of two because it's a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And then it holds commissioners accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| It kind of forces our hand to actually look at the agenda ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| because there's not that kind of cushion work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| where you can come not knowing anything and listen to everybody chat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| and then make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And it can keep us on topic as well because it gives us a narrow window of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| We're there to do business and not just sit and drone on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| And so those are reasons behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| If you want to look at – and it's really to make things more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| and be more streamlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| And, again, have the public in mind for being able to attend meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| because if you think back to some meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| where we've not even gotten through public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| and we've had to go to recess for zonings and then come back to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| those people are sitting there having to wait for a zoning meeting to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| And so this gets it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| And, again, for those who would like to consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| who like the work session and want to talk through it ahead of time with commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| we can have a standing agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| I put it on the draft calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Look, I handed out all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| That's okay. I have an electronic version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| I put it on the same day that work session would take place, but at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| So an hour before beer board starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| We can have it standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| We can have it in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| We can public notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| The public can come if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| But it will still allow for that opportunity for commissioners to sit and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| and go over anything they want to with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| So that's my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| It's really to get rid of redundancy, to make it more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| and to really allow our constituents plus our county employees time back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1104)|
| 0:18:34| in consideration of their lives outside of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| So I'd love to hear your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Again, there's a red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| There's a lot of things that would have to be gone through and talked through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| So in it highlights everywhere where it says work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| One thing we would need to consider is the education consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| But, you know, we don't really discuss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| I think what the way our consent calendar would be formed is if we don't pull it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| from the calendar or the agenda once it's, you know, by a certain day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| then it remains on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| That's pretty much how it's working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| That's how it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| So if we don't pull it, it remains on consent, and we'll bring it up at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| I always like to start with how we got to the point before we think about where we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| Is there any context as to why the structure was placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| I'd say it happened after I became judge because in the before days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| we didn't have work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| We did have committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| But we didn't have the work session as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| So sometime after I left, David, do you know when they spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| When they went from 19 to 11, because you had the finance and environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| And then when you went to 11, they just changed those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| They met a week prior, did they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| I think they just changed it to work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| That was right after I left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Because I believe those committees made a recommendation to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| They went through the agenda and said, OK, we're in favor of number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| We're opposed to number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| We're in favor of number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| And so they had already done the palm work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| And then when you came to commission, you just did take the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| That's exactly how a court works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Your committees do the work, and they bring the recommendations to the voting body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| That's how some of our smaller counties in Tennessee do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| We had talked about that at some point, about should everything go through a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| and come out of a committee first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| We did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Like, everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Before it even hits the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Is that something that we're considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| You're probably talking, if you do that, into making a one-month process into a two-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| So for example, we've got a contract we're about to sign for Westlaw for the governmental library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| We have some changes we want to make to it, or at least talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| We're planning to put that on for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| But if we were to do that, if it's ready in May, it wouldn't be heard until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Because we'd have to put it through the committee system in May, and then a meeting in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| potentially, unless you really compressed a committee meeting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| We did change the rules, though, that anything can be sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| If the commission body feels like they don't have enough information, or they want additional research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| or just more details about something, we did include that in our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| that it can go to a committee, and we can ask them for a recommendation to be sent back to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| So we changed that, and we didn't do that by our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| We just changed it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Yeah, we just changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| But again, it may be that those committees then have to meet monthly rather than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| some of them meet quarterly, some meet every other month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Or they could just be at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| If you have a particular issue that is controversial or difficult and you want it studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| you can appoint an ad hoc committee to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| It doesn't have to be a standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| And they can take the time that they need to look at questions and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and bring it back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| And I do want to mention, too, that I asked in researching for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| and trying to figure out the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| I did go to the mayor's office and asked for his opinion regarding the schedule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| and how it's taxing on the county employees and the senior directors that have to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| and come back, especially when we go into recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| And so I do have a letter of support from the mayor and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| and even a majority of the senior directors of our county department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| well, all of them that I've been able to speak to, are in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| Just because, again, it gives employees that time back at home when they've been here all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| You have to think about PBA as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Because they also have to keep people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| IT, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| And so, yeah, it just eliminates that confusion, too, with constituents on when to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1420)|
| 0:23:50| We've had some that have signed up for public forum, but yet it was really for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| or vice versa, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| So it can help with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Like I said, I've heard for years from constituents about zoning being at 7 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| that it was not very reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Part of that whole schedule change was early on when it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| some of it started at 3 and it was at 5 and then 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| It went back to the two at-large commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Can I be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| When the two at-large commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| they felt like the original commission meeting was at 2 p.m. on the fourth Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| and they felt like if they moved it to 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| the first commissioners would come downtown to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| And, you know, at the time we had great participation from community TV and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Well, I guess I was the deciding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| I thought, well, you know, we should try some because it was a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Well, we've let that test go from how many years ago now to in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| And so, but we are not seeing the public come down like the original intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| So, you know, I guess a year ago we said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| what if we moved the meeting back to 2 o'clock or at least 3 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| We didn't take any action at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| But it may be time for our colleagues from the different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| to maybe start the meeting at 3 o'clock instead of 5 o'clock on the fourth Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| And then hopefully, you know, you'll be done by 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| And a good idea to move these outings to a different day of the month too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| I agree with your point, especially county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| I mean, they are spending long hours in this building for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| I mean, it's really not an efficient use of their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Well, and if you think back to the zoning meetings too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| and the constituents of Commissioner Oster that came and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| their kids because their whole family was there because they were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| adamant about making sure their voice was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| And so, you know, they're saying we move the fast ones up, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| But, you know, they're having the same too when these, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| they need to be attending to their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| You know, it makes it more convenient and accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| especially when it comes to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| And I feel like that's a majority if we're, aside from hot button topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| that's a majority of when we see our constituent participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Is there any downside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| I might just, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| I don't think this is a bad idea at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| I'm wondering if we might not really be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| something to think about might be that if we do all of our presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| all of our honorary resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| and then we have contentious items that we might really be in for a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| haul on our regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| We might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Again, I mean, if we are, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| That's just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| But at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| That could really add some length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| But at the same time, we're getting rid of that zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| So we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| We don't have that to interfere with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| And I've always kind of felt that those meetings have been on separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Well, it's just hard on those days where we recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Or we end at 10 till 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| So I guess our next step would be to make a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| Well, it's still need the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| So that was what I wanted to put before the rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| is for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| I guess the motion would be for the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| to work out the process of what our rules would need to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| especially when you see the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| If you flip through what's in front of you, work session is mentioned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| We've got to go through that and make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| And I'm happy to work with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| He said something interesting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| We're talking about moving more stuff around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| But what if you move your board to the fourth Monday between retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| and pension and commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I've thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Start the commission meeting at 4, but have that 4 to 5 period be where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| have your presentations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| For the most part, nobody's going to attend except the people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| personally invested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| And then your main business would probably start around 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| and people would be there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| So you could have an hour for presentations and honoraries and the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I don't love that as much, only in the sense of sometimes our presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| I think a lot of times our presentations are specifically for the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| but they really are for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Chamber comes and presents on the economic side or our emergency side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| or somebody comes and talks about child trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| I would hate to move those to a period where it's kind of dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| where it doesn't really get the attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Because I think people just sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Can I comment on one of his points real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Mr. Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| I didn't want to interrupt what you were saying, so I wanted to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| One thing I did have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| I did say that your board could remain on the third Monday at 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| or we could move it back to the fourth Monday at 4 to allow time for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| discussion at the agenda review if we needed two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| if we do have that at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And, again, this would be an optional agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| If you're buttoned up and you don't have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| and you know everything that's on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| you don't need to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| So that was also a thought, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| because if you look at the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| I don't know if we're on your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| You weren't, at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| about to get a gender review having the chair and the vice chair there by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| themselves at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Or, like, two commissioners show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| but it's the whole staff that will be there at a gender review in case we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| need to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I think this would be put more on to the commissioner that is bringing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| If you have an issue with an agenda item and would like to talk to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| sponsor of the resolution or the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| this is where you can ask them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| But would all the staff need to be there at all in case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| in case during that agenda review we had an engineering question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| At least it would be on company time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Right, it's during work hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| On top of that, most of us are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| If you have a question, just call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| We can come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| If we're not here in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| we can just come right over and answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| And it could also be incumbent upon the commissioner to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| whomever they need to speak to is available at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| And it can be a set time every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| And so this is where you can bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So you've got an engineering question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Hey, Jim, I've got a question about this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| Can you come to the agenda review meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I guess we can do that in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| we can put that in the forum like we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| We can say I want to pull number five for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| We can provide some instruction to say I want to pull number five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and please bring this information to the consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| or to the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Commissioner Durant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| do you view this as something we would need the clerk's office to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Minutes or notes or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| I think it's almost like a commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| It's an opportunity without violating the Sunshine Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| To be able to discuss a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| If I were creating this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| I would make sure that no voting happens and you don't need a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| It's just an informational opportunity for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| It would also satisfy the thing that you put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Joan, about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| So just being able to talk about the upcoming zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| It's an open forum for having those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| but in a public way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| So CTV would need to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| or would they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| It's up to CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I'd have to look at their group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| It's public notice and the public is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| That's all you need to comply with the public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| CTV doesn't need to be there to comply with the public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I guess the only reason I would keep your board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| and zoning's paired up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| your board's usually pretty secure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| is that retirement and pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| I'd say about half the meetings I've had for six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| are well over an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I hate to rush through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| It's the stuff filled out at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| We have one piece of paper that all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| takes an hour to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| I just had a poor time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Or they're 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| There's nothing in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| They're over an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| You never know until the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| I have a question for you, Commissioner Jank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| I know you had said strike your agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Does what Commissioner Durd is presenting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| does that address any of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| you were going to bring to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Yeah, it's a much better job than what I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I was just going to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| You actually did the entire work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Yeah, it's pretty much just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| where do we overlap our redundancies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| How can we be more efficient with our time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| I'm trying to just think through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| There are times where I have appreciated the extra week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| of time to either mull stuff over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| or I went to the work session with one opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and after a lot of presentation, I kind of left them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| I wonder, could that be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| in a concentrated, shorter amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| all at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I guess I could still change my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| based upon the presentation, but it gave me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I did appreciate it at some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| but it gave me a week to kind of go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| actually, I've got to think about this differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| If you have a question that comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| that's thorny or needs more discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| you can always delay it to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| We can always delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I know what you need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| I'm just thinking through the why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| and I don't see any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| why we couldn't find other tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| to accomplish the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Again, that does bring back the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| if you can ask the sponsor of an agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| to come to that optional agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| because you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| and request their presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| and request they bring more information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Yeah, no, you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| and you can always create another committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| if you get into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Yeah, I do like the efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| It is really hard to focus at 9, 10, 11, 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| when your day started at 5 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| We have been to those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Jonathan, the 1.45 in the morning ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| where you know it's the constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| It's harder on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| I'd second your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| and just go ahead and make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| I think the more time that we present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| to the staff and everyone, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| You want to repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| So motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Whoever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Right, I'm not really sure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Talked it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Look at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Adopt and draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| To what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Adopt and draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Adopt and draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Adopt and draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Yes, let me let the law department speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Amend whatever part of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| that relate to the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Move the zoning portion, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| of our commission meeting to the third Monday at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Have the regular session remain the fourth Monday at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Create an optional agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| on the third Monday at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| That allows no votes, requires no quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| And I think that covers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| So we have a motion by Commissioner Durd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| and a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Oh, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| We will move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Thank you, Commissioner Durd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| So if this is adopted by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I'm sure it wouldn't go in effect until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| So it's December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Yes, it's December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| And therefore, when we do orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| for new commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| we would want to prepare them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| for how the schedule's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I think too, if we adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| that it would be very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| for the commissioners that are already here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| and hopefully commissioners like Commissioner Durd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| and myself to set the tone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| that even though these are not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| that they are optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| that if you're going to really take this thing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| you probably need to plan B there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Because I do have some concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| if you don't do your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Can I just ask you a separate question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| The agenda items are due usually the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| or depending on the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| a couple of days before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And it's the first issue of this released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| The first Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| First Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| First Wednesday of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| and then the second Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| and then it's published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Second Thursday, published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| First Wednesday is C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Because I always have to pick that first cursory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Like, what's the ballpark look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| And then published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| then you get more of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| So that still gives you the Thursday before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| if there's a lot of details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| And then we pull consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| It really doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| And we really don't have a lot of consent anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Well, maybe you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| but you're going to talk about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| at the legislative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| But that's how we create what is consent and what is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| So we could essentially already have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| separated on the agenda as this is consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| and this isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| because there will not be any formal action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| until we get to the legislative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| That helps to get confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I remember when we kind of retooled this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| it was a confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| We had two different agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| that looked two different formats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| And so we will have one agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| and it could even say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| by that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| we will know what's consent and what isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| because we will not be able to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| To approve or move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| So right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| the commission's zoning agenda is together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So if you do it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| is there going to be two different agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| that needs to go out at the beginning of the month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| I think it could still be together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| because the agendas are still being released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Two separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Well, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| they could be two separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| but they would still be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| they could go out on the same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| but they would be two separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| they would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| So they would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I was trying to go through all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| because there's a lot of highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| We worked with Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Moving on to number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Discussion of placing zoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| approved on consent by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| at the beginning of the County Commission Zoning Meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| to be read individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| This would impact from the 7D order of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| This request would be to allow the landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| and developers to work with the community on every zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| and then they receive a placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| on the Knox County planning agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| designated as a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| And of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| that a consent item on Knox planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| means that there was no contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| from either on the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| on either email, phone, phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| and or even, you know, a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And so, and of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| then no one comes in Knox planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| and opposes, you know, this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| So what we would be in essence doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| is allowing those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| who've done all this work in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| and there's nothing that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| no one in the community opposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| that those people would then earn the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| to go to the top of the zoning agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| so that those items can be heard first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| because most of them are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| you know, read the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Boom, we vote, we go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| because what's happened over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| is we get the data from Knox planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| and put it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| based on the file number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| So the last three items on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| could all be consent items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| and they've sat through hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| of citizen debate on a particular rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| like for instance, like yours last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| What we did, we did a test last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| All consent items were at the first of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| So those people got up and went home, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and if you're a landowner, builder, or contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| you know, if you've done your homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| and the community's happy with what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| And of course, this would also apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| if you have a sector plan amendment as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| where it's tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| So it just seems like a logical transition to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| if the public has no problem with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| go to the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| If someone shows up to our commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| and says, hey, I'm opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| well, then we get to hear that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Yes, Jackie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Would you consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| are you suggesting that we have a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| as part of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Just when we listed that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| the first one is file, you know, R-27 whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| It's just the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| It's just the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| because it went through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| on their consent part at the beginning of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| But since we're taking legislative action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| it's just those that are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| She might shake us at the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| No, it still has to be read individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| and recorded and a vote taken and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| It just seems like, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| if we're making people come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| let's let them get out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| at a reasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| It requires a 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Yeah, whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| 14-0 consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Yeah, and it always says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| it's always transmitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Not only from the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| but from the docs plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| There's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| There's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| The planning commission...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| When the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| does their consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| it's those applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| there's no contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| and they take one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| When it's transmitted over to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| it says 14-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| and those were the number present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| and it says consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Now, they may go to the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| and that's a 14-0 vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| but it wasn't on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| It's only those that were designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| through Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| with no public opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Who creates that agenda for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| And then they transmit it to Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| And so last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Drew, as a test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| which was great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| we put all those at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| They flew right through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Now, the items that go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| the planning consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| that's the one committee in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I've never spent a lot of time with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| are they always cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| where the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| is in accord with the planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| No, I understand what you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Okay, so let's say we've got to be PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Somebody wants to rezone PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Planning staff recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Is it always going to be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| if the matter is on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| that the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| and the staff are on the same page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Or is there ever a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| where planning staff says four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| planning commission says three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| but it gets on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| It never gets to that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| That's why...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Because in their agenda review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| too, that's another red flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| If something is controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| these are non-controversial items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| So what happens is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| they take one vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| on all the consent things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| at the beginning of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Then they start their regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| So there's no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Yeah, because we're the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I would just suggest that if we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| even if there's no debate or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| that the motion be framed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| we're going to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| per planning commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| We can do it like we do it normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| They're just orders shifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Because you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Even if something is not controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| even if it goes on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| somebody could still bring a challenge to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| For whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| And so I have to be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| where I can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| they had all this information in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| This was the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Therefore, they had a rational basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| for doing what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| And that's why we don't just do consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Because we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| And that's what I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| I would ask Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| to work with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| in planning to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| What we're basically doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| is we're taking our set agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| as we currently have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| and changing the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| just like we did last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| That's all we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Nothing's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Nothing from planning is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| It's just when Drew receives the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| she goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| okay, number one's consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| number seven's consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| number 12's consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Now I'm going to make them one, two, and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| and then we're going to go four, five, six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Do you need a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| out of this committee to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Is it a rule change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| It's a rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Because it's the ordered procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| It'd be rule seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| section D, ordered procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I'll make a motion to reorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| or yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| to amend our zoning meeting agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| by placing the consent item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| at the top of the ordered list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| We have a motion by Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| a second by Dirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you for that positive recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Moving on to agenda item eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| discussion and consideration of amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| the structure of an appointment to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| And we have five committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| K, beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Jim's passing around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| and thank you, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| for working with me on getting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| As I brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| in the last rule committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| that I would like to see beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| instead of being full commission as it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| change that over to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| So it would be done in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| when we do our reord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| And so I think the one thing I've thought about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| and I didn't say anything to Jill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| because I wanted to get to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| and then talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I had put in here five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Maybe better to move it to seven members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| and I'm good with changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| And I will just say the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| I have gotten some phone calls from applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| who felt it was unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| when their commissioner in their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| won't give them a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| but they punish them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| when it comes time to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| if there was a problem in that store, restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| whatever the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| And I understand that there are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| who have religious preferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| not to be involved with alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| So I think it's easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| for the people who don't want to participate in beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| to just not be on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| And that's the reason that I'm bringing them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| We really need to think about our applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| because they are taxpaying citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| that are trying to open a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| doing something legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| but they kind of feel a little slighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| by that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| So that really is the reason that I brought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| was not to have an issue with anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| or anybody's particular feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| It's just I feel like it's more fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| to the public and to the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| that's coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you, Commissioner Escher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Does anyone have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Commissioner Jake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I agree with Commissioner Escher on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| We've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| and I think you're going to participate here at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| There's no language in here that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| that if you're going to be part of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| you're going to be part of all the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I'm wondering if that is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| because I can still see a commissioner saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I want to be part of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| and then getting on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| and still doing the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Can we put language in here that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| well, anybody who is going to serve on the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| must participate in all motion, in all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| Categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| All votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Something like that, or can you require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| so that they don't pull the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| I mean, OK, it doesn't fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| because you can participate and vote by passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| by abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| You don't have to say that all commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| must vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And that's kind of a dangerous road to go down, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| when you start telling each other what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| I have a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Because technically, they're still participating now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| They're still voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| They're not abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| No one is recusing themselves or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| So they still go down as a yes vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| whether they say it to the microphone or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| I think the language maybe should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| if your district has a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| that is before the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| you have to participate in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| It goes to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| It does not go to the at-large commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| It can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| I don't know if it would still prevent somebody from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Well, I think your intention is to create a standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| And so therefore, you wouldn't have every district commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| on the standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| It would just be seven members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Just like we do with all of our other boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| Is anyone interested in serving on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Nominate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| And that's how you fill those roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I certainly do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| and I will have to credit our very astute law partner here to my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| The way you have the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| the committee idea, by the way, is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| And I think you're right on seven, just because of the emphasis and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| But I think that if you're serving on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| all actions are by roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Because right now, we've got people that are staying silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| and we're passing beer licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| With two of us going yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| So I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| I like the roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| You can put that in your rules that every transaction is a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| And then if you don't want to be on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| you're going to get off pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I don't mean to ask a weird question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| but I'm going to ask a weird question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Do committee members, does this committee members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| That will be the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Does this committee member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| because it's the Beer Board and Beer Board Laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| have to be made up of commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| That's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| It does not have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| You could appoint a group of seven citizens on the Beer Board if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I'm not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| It's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| However, I do not feel comfortable with that being the one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| This is a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| This is something we're tasked with doing, people elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I do have a question about the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Commissioner Husser, did you chair the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| I mean, did you strike the chair of the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| like the vice chair is the chair of the Beer Board for a reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Well, if your vice chair does not want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| So just like a standing committee, you would elect a chair and a vice chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Once the committee is formed, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| So Jill, we would need to change in here, add the roll call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| that it would be a roll call vote, and seven members instead of five members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| Do we want to move this forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| I mean, I'm good with coming back the next time that we meet with the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Because it's not going to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| I'll second that if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| When do you want this to go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Can I just make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| I like it all too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| I hate to have, especially a new commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| though, not be able to serve if they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| want this to be a part of their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| And I kind of even wonder about the seven number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Because I'm thinking, I mean, I think realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| we have two or maybe three at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| that tend to choose not to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| But two of those are rolling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I just hate to leave anybody out if they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| would want to take this as part of their role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| But just like we do that right before reorg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| is Drew sends out the committees and people sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| for what they think they'd be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| If there's a new member and I say, I'll be on beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| but a new member really wants to do it and we need that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| I'm happy to roll off of beer board because I've been on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| and give that person that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So it's really four members of commission that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| not going to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| I think this is one of those where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| we almost encourage new people to go on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| because the laws are kind of set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| There's not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| It's kind of a good way to get your feet wet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| with a lot of stuff that isn't already determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Commissioner Olsen, would you like to make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Do I need to make the motion to add the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| members and the roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| So I'll make the motion to move beer board to a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| during reorg for seven members with roll call votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3411)|
| 0:57:00| and for this to go into effect September 1, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Did I get everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| We have a motion by Oster, a second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| So will this be on our main agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| Do you want to move it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| I guess you could do it any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I can do them all at once if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| So if you will, can you make this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| to be added through by July 1, 2024?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| And the resolution would wait until September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| at the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| You have to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| There's an ordinance involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| It's an ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| You have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Because right now, this is the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| administering the laws for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| But can we change the ordinance right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| after September 1 and go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| That would be too real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| But we could do it May, June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| I was going to just, for the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| put a resolution effective September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I wasn't going to distribute rules in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| with those changes yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| I was just going to wait to put them in, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| So the ordinance, you don't have to add in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| We're not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| That's what I was planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| No, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Moving on to our last item on the agenda, discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| consideration, review, and approval of function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| procedure, and structure of the county-related boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| and communities in Rule 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| So we've kind of spent a great deal of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| looking over these and discussing all the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| and boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| And what we know is we have a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| And we also know that most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| fall under some sort of state law, a county charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| a county code, or organizations by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| There are those that were created by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| or with an MOU or a contract with a group or organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| And so after a lot of discussion with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| we really cannot identify any that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| should be dissolved or combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| I know that's probably not what we were all hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| The ones that can be considered are the arena use committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| But this is created in an MOU between UT, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| and EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| The disability advisory group, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| is from a resolution by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Ethics committee is created in the code of ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| approved by a resolution of the commission and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3581)|

| 1:00:14| And then visit Knoxville board, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| created as stated in the contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| I don't have a recommendation of slimming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| the number of boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| They all seem to serve a very valid purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| What we are doing is Drew and I have gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and we have looked at the fact sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| We're going to amend the fact sheets a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| to include information for each board and committee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| includes name, when it was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| the appointment, the members, qualifications or requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| of those members, their term, the duties and purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| of the body, the meeting schedule and location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| and then a contact person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| So we're going to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| And then we're also going to create a single binder that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| will have and house every fact sheet with tabs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| so that any commissioner, if they want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| well, when does this committee meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| they can come to that single binder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| So we're going through all the binders, find it, locate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| If there's a contact they need to reach out to, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| And so that's where we are on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| if the body's OK with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Sadly, again, we looked at these long and hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| And I know Commissioner Gay had looked at this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| We did it six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| The first year I was on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| It's been like four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| And so additionally, what we are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| we will have a draft letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| We are going to send this letter along with the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| of Ethics policy and also the attendance policy to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| of the boards and committees and just encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| them to go by those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| If they don't have an ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| if they don't have an attendance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| we're providing them with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| We can't force them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| However, we will encourage them to implement and adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| If they have an ethics policy or an attendance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| they may want to update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| So if everyone can take a look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| if you're OK with this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Yes, Director Lueb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I've been on that ethics committee since I started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| And what you've got to be careful of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| is getting the committee to create their own ethics, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| might be in contradiction with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| because our ethics resolution, our ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| was created pursuant to 8-17-105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| And so it applies under the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| to every elected official or every employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| I mean, that's what the state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| So I can say if somebody wants their own separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| or some committee wants its own separate ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| be sure that it doesn't in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| contradict or raise any issues with an already existing one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| which applies, by definition, to every employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| and every elected official and every committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Director Lueb, do you have any suggested revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| to this letter that would take care of that concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| or address that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| And you can send it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| I'll just send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| But it would just be that thing about, in the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| let it be known that all ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| In fact, every elected official, every employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| is required under that ethics resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| to undergo training from, who does the training, Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Anthony Set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I can't remember his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| He does a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| I went through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Everybody in the law department went through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| when they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| And it's just, it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| And the new commissioners are required to undergo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| Is that required for appointees also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| For what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Appointees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Yeah, anybody that's going to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| under the municipal or county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| has got to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Who administers with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| And that's, again, his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| He's very good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| He doesn't boggle you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Well, you did it during orientation or CTAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| I think you had, maybe you did it during the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| you would have normally done it with the CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| but you may not have been with the CTAS here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| because you came in the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Because you didn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Yeah, you didn't do it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| It's most of that training that CTAS provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| It's like, CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| What we adopted, the state law said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| that MTAS for the municipalities, CTAS for the counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| will come up with a model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| And we, with just a few tweaks, adopted the CTAS policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| That's what we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Director Boone, Director Gorge, do we need to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| if this is just, we're not making any changes to any rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| We're just kind of doing some housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| If the body's comfortable, we'll move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| So that brings us to number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Do we have any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| Seeing none, do we want to schedule our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240404-rules-committee?start=3957)|
