| 0:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=70)|

| 0:01:21| Seconded by Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Commissioner Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| The MPC report noted a sinkhole toward the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| What kind of action will be taken to deal with any slope issues or problems associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| with the sinkhole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| I'm not familiar with any sinkhole on the site, and I did not see any report that indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| that there was a sinkhole on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| I quote from the MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| It's comments section number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| The site's topography shows a sinkhole in the southern portion of the property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| will need to be protected in any development of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Commissioner, once plans are developed for that site, the applicant developer will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| to address that sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| There are certain provisions to keep away from that sinkhole, so that puts the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| on notice that in the design of the subdivision that sinkhole will have to be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| It can't be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| That's all I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Sir, could you give us your name again and your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Walter R. Lane, and I'll use my home address, I guess, 2897 Lakeside Drive, Lenoir City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=146)|
| 0:02:34| Tennessee, 37772.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| The motion is to approve the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission for approval of the Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Tree Conservation and Planning Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| They recommend it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Jack Huddleston, I mean, Commissioner Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| I'd just like Mike Carberry to speak to this just briefly, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| just to summarize some of the documentation for the members of the commission that may not be so familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=198)|
| 0:03:28| I'm Mike Carberry, the Director of the Comprehensive Planning Division at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| This plan has been a few years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| An original draft of it called for a series of ordinances, which caused some angst with development interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| We're looking mainly to incentive-related programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| There is one ordinance that's called for in the plan, and that's the creation of a city-county tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| The city currently has a tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| The county does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| The purpose of that board would be to provide recommendations to the mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| and legislative bodies on public tree planting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| and advice giving on other programs that might be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| When we use the term incentive-based, an example would be transferring the densities that could be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=250)|
| 0:04:19| on a rolling to steep terrain to the toe of a slope to preserve trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| and then even perhaps allowing increased densities at the toe of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| MPC unanimously approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| City Council has approved it and wanted it passed on as well to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| And I would just like to encourage, as opposed to Commissioner Lambert's comments that he's not a tree hugger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| I'm an unabashed tree hugger, and I'm bringing Commissioner Lambert along with me, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| He's making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| But I would like to commend the MPC staff, of course, and Mike Carberry for all their work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| This is something that I fervently believe is just as important to Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| our consideration of our hillsides and our streams and the development of our county as something such as the Devon property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| and the Sentinel Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| It's very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| It's very important to the people of Knox County, and this has been substantiated over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| and I appreciate their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Request of Benchmark and Associates for rezoning from A. Agricultural and O.A. Office Park to C.A. General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| The property is located on the southeast side of Hardin Valley Road, southeast of Reagan Road and the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| Seeing no opposition, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| We move for approval per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| I see on here they've got a number and it says only, for partial only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Is that fine with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Just the front part of the partial only is all they're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Benny Moorman with Benchmark Associates, 10308 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Well, that was my concern was that there was neighborhood opposition regarding the back portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| but you're not going to be dealing with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| You're just going to be dealing with the front portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| We're accepting MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| Recommendation to rezoning just the front portion, not the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| And that seems to have satisfied the neighbors because have you talked to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| I haven't spoken with them directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| but all representation we had throughout the entire process was for the rear only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| I don't know if you have a copy of the map or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| but it's a very small triangular portion out front that adjacent to it's already zoned like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| If you're going to do it that way, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Commissioner Cateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I haven't heard any opposition to this, just to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Neither have I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=438)|

| 0:08:17| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Seeing no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Well, I see the recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| The question here, looking at the parcel, the zoning is not out of character in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| but this is a very long, narrow parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| And I was just wondering how you plan to do that and meet setback lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| and distance everything else in order to actually develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| I plan to file for appeals to the Board of Zoning if this is approved for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| and cut in an access road to serve the back of the lot and then would be able to meet most of the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| The only one that would meet is the existing house in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| Does the MVC staff, have you looked at this to actually how you would do the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| It's a very long, narrow track of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| It looks like it's the width of most subdivision lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| and it looks like if you went in for both directions you could get two coming off each road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| and that looked like that worked, but three seems like just how you would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| He's working with a situation here where he's under a pretty big hardship with the shape of the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| as you pointed out, and its size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| In this particular case, variances will probably be in order in order for him to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| to even be able to reasonably use his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| It could be that he may be only, you know, we'll just have to wait and see when the plat comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| Even with the variances, the plat may be problematic, but we won't know until we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| But, you know, this is a situation where you've got a terrible situation in terms of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| that variances and some relief probably are in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| But we won't know for sure until we actually see the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| You can give some assurance that you've looked at it and studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| So I would move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=620)|

| 0:12:20| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Given the fact that there were some letters written opposing this, have you satisfied those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=743)|
| 0:12:33| I don't know why they're not here or speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Commissioner, there were three letters that were sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| I talked to two of the individuals, spent an hour with one and 30 minutes with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| One was an engineering problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| I think that was resolved or will be resolved when the build-out occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| The other one was a piece of property that was located within this 11-acre, these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=777)|
| 0:13:07| We worked with them or him to make an offer to purchase that property if it were reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| and he thinks working on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Other than that, we talked to all the neighborhood people in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=796)|
| 0:13:26| and we have a petition that represents about, I think it's 64% of the 22 owners immediately adjacent to this 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=806)|
| 0:13:38| And we have no opposition from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| Well, I know most of those people that have written letters, known them for years, and also received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| The only phone call received was a person I've known for umpteen years who wanted to express in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=830)|
| 0:13:59| But reading the others, I'm surprised that they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| We've talked with everybody we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Well, that's a good procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| And we've sent a memo with maps to everybody we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| We had a page, a 20-page packet, I think, that each of you received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| And we've tried to cover that with everybody in the whole neighborhood that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| And the whole thing was that the Carroll Bend Road is about three miles, three-and-a-half miles long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| And what we're doing is in the first half mile of it doesn't even go past that first 180-degree turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| so we don't affect anybody on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| I don't really believe that you'll probably have more than one per two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| three acres on any other piece of land because of slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=888)|

| 0:16:16| Next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| These are requests of M.H. Schubert, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| The first is for a northeast county sector plan amendment from rural residential to low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| The second is for a rezoning from agriculture to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| They're located on the northwest side of Babley Road, east side of Harris Road in the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Arthur Seymour, Jr., on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| You all may sit down for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Have a big group today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Let's get an MPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Commissioners, as was read into the record, this is a request by M.H. Schubert for two approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| an amendment to the northeast county sector plan and a rezoning from agriculture to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| The applicant requested three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| The plan amendment is from rural residential to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| This is in an area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| It is designated on the growth policy plan for rural development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| However, it is an extension of the urban growth boundary, which is to the west side of Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1056)|
| 0:17:47| The property includes approximately 106 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| The proposed use is single-family subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| It is a large tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Existing use is on the property as a residence, and the rest of it is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| The growth policy plan, if it is an extension of either the plan growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| or the urban growth area, you're allowed to consider up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| This meets that test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| The staff did recommend three dwelling units per acre with planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| The planning commission, in listening to the testimony and the comments from the applicant at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| however, voted to approve a density of 2.5 dwelling units per acre by a 7-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| The property in the area, you can see your maps, especially the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| It is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| You're just beyond the edge of the urban growth boundary, as I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| You do have a little bit of RB zoning down in the corner there that you can see on your zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| So it is, I guess if we're looking at, and we've talked about this before being an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| this is an extension of that particular designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| and we felt like it was at least appropriate to consider densities above one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| With those thoughts in mind, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| the planning commission recommended approval of the plan amendment to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| and a rezoning of planned residential at a density of up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Who would like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| I am here on behalf of the applicant, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Bill, could you help me pass out something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| I'm going to pass out an overview showing, in pretty good perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1190)|
| 0:20:00| the location of this property and the development that is nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| As Mr. Johnson has stated, this is a request for a rezoning plan amendment for 106 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| plus or minus, between Babley Road, east of Harris Road, and south of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| The property is presently zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| We are requesting planned residential at a density of up to, and I would emphasize up to, 2.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1227)|
| 0:20:38| The applicant is Alex Hubert, who is here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Alex, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Alex's family has been in the development business here in Knox County for 60-plus years, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1244)|
| 0:20:53| When I was growing up, they were developing West Hill Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| They have developed some of the finest subdivisions in Knox County, Kensington, Sheffield, just to give you the names of a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1257)|
| 0:21:06| The original request to MPC that we made on behalf of Mr. Hubert was for three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| MPC staff recommended this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| At MPC, after discussion, we said our preliminary concept plan showed, at best, we would be able to do 2.5 units per acre on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1276)|
| 0:21:29| Now, to develop this property at anything other than the agricultural zone, we're going to have to bring in sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| The cost of bringing that in is minimally estimated at $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| If our rezoning request is granted, we will do underground utilities in the subdivision and, of course, water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| I understand we have opponents here who want us to leave the property zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1314)|
| 0:22:03| Whether you approve agricultural or leave it at agricultural or grant our request, the property is going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1323)|
| 0:22:16| I submit to you what you are doing in considering this zoning request here today is what type of development will occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1336)|
| 0:22:28| and how it will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Under the agricultural zone, you can develop property at one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| You've got to chop up square lots of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| You will have septic tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| You may even have wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| Property, as you can see, is close enough to East Town Mall and to an area of East Knox County that is rapidly growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1367)|
| 0:22:56| And there is a demand for housing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| So it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| The decision will be how do we develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Will we do the type of subdivision that is ecologically and environmentally sound, that is, has sewer, has water, has underground utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1386)|
| 0:23:21| or will we just let it develop under the ag zone as a lot of property has in East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| and, for that matter, other parts of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| The reason we cannot develop it under the ag zone and do a subdivision that Mr. Schubert would want to do is the sewer issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| He does not want to do a subdivision on septic tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| And bringing sewer to the property is a cost of $750,000 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| And economics are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| If you bring sewer to the property, you cannot develop it at one unit per acre, 1.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| or even two units per acre because of the infrastructure cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| If you're going to do underground utilities, you cannot develop it at one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| These are all cost items that have to be recouped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| So this is the issue you have before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| You want 100-plus homes scattered around on the property with septic tanks without a unified development, perhaps with well water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1475)|
| 0:24:46| or do you want a planned development with potentially 150 more homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| And that's what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Let's say we've got 100 acres here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Under the ag zone, roughly 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| We're asking for the opportunity to develop an additional 150 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| That's the difference between what we say and what our opponents say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| Now, is that going to occur in one fell swoop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| A subdivision of this size will take eight to ten years to build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| Construction would not start until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| There's a lot of preliminary work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| Planning, engineering, work with utility groups to get everything in place for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| We are asking for the opportunity to do a good subdivision within a little over three miles of East Town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1540)|
| 0:25:50| rather than a haphazard development of this 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| which has occurred in other instances in West, North, South, and East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| We think it's time to bring planning to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| As you well know, granting the zoning today does not entitle Mr. Schubert to do anything as far as construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| He can't turn one spade out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| He will have to submit a concept plan for review by the MPC staff for public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| and for review by the Board of Zoning Appeals, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Then he can start doing his utilities and road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| And then, and only then, can he start to build homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| And that's a couple of years down the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| So what we're asking you to do here today is approve a planned development for this 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1604)|
| 0:26:54| Let Mr. Schubert do what he has done in West Hills, in Kensington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| and in some of the other premier neighborhoods in our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| And we would ask that you all approve the plan amendment and the zoning in accord with MPC's staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1626)|
| 0:27:16| Actually, it's a little less than staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Okay, Mr. Seymour, your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And in accord with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Okay, the opposition's time, and time is 446.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| We didn't hire an attorney this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| We thought that it would be better for you to hear directly from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| We're going to speak straight from the heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| although we will be respectful of your time and try not to repeat any points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| Mr. Seymour says that this is, you know, a development that is needed in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1671)|
| 0:28:02| This rezoning was denied in 2005, the same plan, for good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| We haven't met with Mr. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| This was Mr. Irwin made the original application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| But I understand Mr. Schubert has joined along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| I spoke with Mr. Irwin briefly this morning, and I understand it's the same plan from 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| Me and several dozen, at least, of my neighbors spent about six months of our lives working on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| which this body adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| In fact, our sector plan, the Northeast Knox sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| was the first sector plan that was actually adopted by a county commission in a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| And in that sector plan, we took a really hard, good look at the land in that sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| and tried to figure out where the best areas for development are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| where the places where the land had constraints and problems and issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| because there's a lot of that land that does have problems and issues in our sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| A lot of sinkholes, and then there's a lot of ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| It's a beautiful area, and I hope some of you have driven through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| But, anyway, this property was designated on the sector plan as going to stay in the rural boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1759)|
| 0:29:30| and be a rural-type development, a rural-type piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| And as a property owner who lives not very far from this, in fact, a few hundred yards, I have 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1778)|
| 0:29:49| And when the urban growth plan was put into place, what happened was they drew the line right down the middle of Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| Unfortunately for me, my property is on the side that's in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| So that means at some point I'll be in the city and pay city taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| Well, I guess that's okay if I am allowed to develop my property at a higher standard and a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| It should make my property more valuable to be inside the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| But what is happening and what we're really concerned about this issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| is that if we let developers go into the rural boundary and buy land less expensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| then they would have to pay for property that is zoned correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| And they buy it less, they buy agricultural land less expensively, and then they can get it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| It's penalizing me and my property because my property is going to be less valuable because when it gets developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| it will have to be, you know, city taxes paid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| So I really, I know that I speak for a lot of people here when I say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| we pay a lot of money for these plans to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| And I think that it behooves this body to pay attention to those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| In particular, you know, on the sector plan, as I said, this body did adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1871)|
| 0:31:22| And I think that it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| During the sector plan process, we take into account all the development that's happening in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| And what happens at MPC, unfortunately, is they look at this property and then that property and then that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| And, you know, the traffic study that was done, they used the same one from 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| Well, there's been I don't know how many hundreds of homes developed in that area since that traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| And I think if you did it now, you would see Harris Road is totally unsuitable for any kind of traffic in this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| Well, I know there's some other people that want to speak, so I'm going to go ahead and finish here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| I think that the MPC approval was based on somewhat faulty information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| or misleading information when it says that there's a low-density development to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| That development they're referring to is Rushland Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| which is another example of taking a side of a ridge and stripping it of vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and then having some severe flooding problems, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| as a member of the stormwater board, I'm well aware of all the flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| I think it's starting to be a new day in Knox County where every piece of property maybe can't be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| at the kind of densities that we have approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And I think that the county is going to start to be held responsible for approving projects that may cause water damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| So, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Mr. Samuel, do you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| You've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| I would just like to point out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Ms. Starbuck indicated that we hadn't contacted her, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| I did not know she was opposing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| She did not appear at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| There were three people who spoke at the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| three or four who were there in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| She was not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| She did not speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| She knows Mr. Irwin, and it was only last week that we found out she was opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| and Mr. Irwin did contact her at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| There are no problems with sinkholes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| There are no drainage issues on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| There are no slope issues on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| There is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| There is under an acre, and we've got engineering data rather than anecdotal evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| There's one acre on this property that has over a 15% slope, and that will not be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| We have the engineering data on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| This is very rolling, good property for subdivision development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| No issues about off-site draining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| We aren't cutting down a ridge line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I don't understand what that allegation is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Traffic study shows that this property can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| And, finally, there was some, we understood there was some issue about fire protection for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| Bill, could you hand this letter around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| Mr. Irwin here checked with the rural metro, which provides fire protection in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| and actually the development of this property would help fire protection, according to the chief with rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2078)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| We've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Yes, I have a question for Ms. Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Approximately how far from this development do you live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Several hundred yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| As Buzz Johnson likes to say, this seems to be the flavor of the month for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| Several people have called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I went out there last night, spent about an hour, walked over the site quite a bit, and went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| And a lot of people have called me, and I promised, you know, let's give these people some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| because they've taken their time out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| I want to hear what they've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And on the same token, give Mr. Seymour if he wants to rebuttal and then have some things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| But let's air this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| In opposition, you all have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| And then we'll have to, if commissioners want to allow some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| we'll have to put some time limits on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Charlene Widener, 6526 Bailey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| I want to bring up an issue of some safety and some school overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| Lisa's handing out a newspaper article about a school bus wreck that happened not too awful long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| And it was on the hill that's within probably a few hundred yards from one of the main entrances to this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| And Harris Road is a narrow, winding road that is designed for the amount of traffic that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| it's not designed for the amount of traffic that this project would generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| A school bus overturned on this road in 2003, prompting the sheriff to declare Harris Road a very slick and dangerous hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| And that does not mean it's just in the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| I drive this road every day, taking my child to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| And the time, if you meet bus 66 on this road, you either have to stop or you have to put it in the ditch, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2194)|
| 0:36:43| The combination of the commuter traffic from Union County to the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| shoppers coming from the new target development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| and local residents make traffic gridlock a real concern, and there's no planned road improvements anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| The MPC allowed the developers to use a traffic study from 2005 that was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| which does not take into account all the new developments in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| nor does it allow that the traffic be generated in the future because of projects that are already approved but not yet built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| The school overcrowding has the MPC reports the estimated 153 children will be added to the area schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2239)|
| 0:37:29| but there's no discussion about the school's ability to absorb that many students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Rita Elementary is 101 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| The enrollment from May 2006 to May 2007 was 75 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| and that does not include, like I said, the developments that are going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Most of the developments within a three-mile radius only have a handful of houses that are being occupied at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| So that does not include any of the other developments in new school children that's going to be coming to Rita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| Rita has not received any grades in the cafeteria, gym, or the library in nearly 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2280)|
| 0:38:08| I went there 30 years ago. I go there every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| It's the exact same as when I went to school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| They may have a couple of classrooms that they may be able to add students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| but the students don't just stay in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| That school is very old and needs improvement before you add another 300 homes to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| And the last thing is that the burden for rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| the nearest rural metro fire stations to that piece of property is Forks of the River, which is 11.8 miles away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| and Harbison's Crossroads, which is 11 miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| So I appreciate your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Okay. Your three minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| I wanted to make sure I understood this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| How many students are at Rita currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| I don't have the total of what the entire student body is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I just know that the enrollment is up in one year of over 75 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Okay. And this development is projected to put how many more students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Well, the figures that we were given was 153 in just this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| I think that's for all ages, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| It would be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| It would be all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Yes, it would be first through eighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| High school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Yeah, it would be K through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| It would also be during the whole build out of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| I have a question for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| Looking at this map, like I said, I went up there and I stayed for about an hour last night looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| walking over it, went up Harris Road, went up Link Road, went up to Fox Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| looked at that subdivision and drove up and down Babley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Where is there going to be more than one entrance on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| How is this going to start off as far as entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| They talk about Harris Road and coming in from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Where is going to be your first entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| The entrances will be, there will be an entrance on Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| There will also be an entrance, just a second, on Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| How many entrances are there, Alex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| One laid out on Babley Road, possibly two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Where is your first one going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| That's going to be your primary entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| That's going to be the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Now, if I'm a resident and I'm living down this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| help me understand something here, how this sewer stuff works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| How far up do you have to bring the sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| You're bringing it up how far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Alex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| It's over about a mile and a half just to get it to the edge of the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| If I'm within that mile and a half, and who's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Is this northeast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Who's the sewer on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| KUB has sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Do they give the residents that are on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| do they give them some sort of break if they want to tie in at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Is there any incentive for them to tie on at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| I don't think they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I don't know of an incentive KUB gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Obviously, they're happy with every customer they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| So anybody who wants to tap onto the sewer line is certainly welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| A question on let's look at what we're looking at price-wise on these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| What are these homes going to sell for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| $350 to $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| And Fox Ridge, what do those homes sell them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Fox Ridge has to be probably, I'm going to guess, at least twice that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| But, of course, they're on the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| They've got the views of the mountains both ways, which we do not have in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| They've got rather spectacular views up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| It's very pretty up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| I did not price any of the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| I just guessed from looking at them up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| It may be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Up at Harris Road, and we're talking about, Buzz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| will you all make them do anything on their entrance or exit, egress or anything coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| It depends on the detailed traffic impact analysis, which has to be done at the next stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| That would be required for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Buzz, maybe you can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| We're looking at new stormwater ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| and I'd assume that if this is approved that by the time they're into the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| they'll have to adhere to our new stormwater ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Whatever is in place and whatever we're working on now, that would be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| If it's not approved and they're developing it as agricultural at one unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| is there something in the ordinance that they would still have to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Or what's the guidelines there when you're doing a development under agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| Are there still regulations that they'd have to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| I can't cite specific, but, yes, whatever requirements regarding drainage, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| That wouldn't make any difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Unless you did minor subdivisions through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| I'm sorry, but what was your answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Unless you were doing minor subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| which have been done up and down Bateley Road where you just take out an acre or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| or up to, what, four units, four lots, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| Yes, but you would still have minimal requirements to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| Would they be astringent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| No or yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Minor subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| I'm not familiar with the new language that's in the storm ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| but I would suspect that as the density decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| the astringency of the stormwater management also decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| so that a one-acre lot would have much less pervious surface, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| wouldn't have the same sort of requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Mr. Seymour, you got a rather large chuckle from the contingent a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| about something you said about the ridgelines, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Was that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Could you address that disdain or whatever it was for that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| The topo maps show there's actually less than one acre that has over 15 percent slope on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| It's not like the top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| This is a gently rolling property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Somebody mentioned somebody lopping off ridges down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| That is not involved in this property because the slopes are very gentle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| And I'm sure MPC did a slope analysis on the property before they even considered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| So, Buzz, do you concur with the area that's to be excavated is relatively rolling as opposed to steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2719)|
| 0:45:31| That's my impression in terms of looking at the staff analysis that we did for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| We don't even show it on the sector plan as being having a slope constraint, although it does show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| Let me double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| We do show that the site does have some slope characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| We do have small portions of the site that are constrained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| but a very small portion relative to some other things we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Like Commissioner Smith, I took a look and rode around and discovered that, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| part of this property drains into the First Creek Watershed in the second district, my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| I think a reasonable person would describe this as a slope, as a forested ridge with lots of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| As points have been made, the roads, schools, fire metro service, all of that is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| I just think it reflects the height of lack of imagination to think that the only alternative is a bunch of scattered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| smaller developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Why can't we start thinking about brownfields and grayfields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| There's an industrially zoned area fairly close to this that could be reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| And we're not thinking that direction, and I wish we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| And I want to hear more from the neighborhood residents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| I would just like, if we get into a time situation in making the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| I want to reserve five minutes now after the motion is made to sort of sum up some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| because this has been lobbied hard on both sides, and I want to make points for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Each side has had their allotted time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Do you want someone, a commissioner, want to allow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| I'll give each individual three minutes, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Is that enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| Guys, if we keep doing this, we're going to be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Let's go with two minutes and then let them rebut and let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Okay, sir, if you'll give your name and address for the record, it's 508.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| My name is Bill Boone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| I live at 7014 Babley Road near the end at Bud MacMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| My wife and I moved here just under five years ago and built a home there on the family property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| I married Nancy Link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| That's who Link Road is named after, the Link family, and we're on part of the Link farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| We're only about a half mile from Link Road and close to where this development will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| I would take exception also to the contention or the thought that developing one acre plots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| and houses on that would be in a sort of a random or unorganized manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| I don't find any houses in our area that fit that description that are on one acre or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| and there's some good size houses being built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| I want to address specifically one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| We talked about runoff and environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Two and a half homes per acre is going to scrape out a lot of trees and a lot of dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| and there will be significant runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| And I'll give you an example of Chestnut Ridge that's only about a half mile from the end of Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2928)|
| 0:48:56| How that got approved I don't know because there are many slopes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And after each rain, Mr. Tom Phillips has a pond and a nice home at the bottom of the hill just across Ellis Town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| and his lake turns red each time there's a good rain from the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| The mitigation plan for runoff just doesn't exist there and doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| And that water ultimately runs into the Holston River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| and people concerned about the environment and runoff should be concerned because this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| particularly at that density, would cause significant environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And I'll restrain my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Hello. James McMillan, 4715 McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| I want to stick to one issue, and it's basically drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| The county-approved Beaver Creek study proves that upland hillside developments significantly increase sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| and erosion pollution into Beaver Creek compared to lowland areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| The study also proved that hillside developments create a tremendous increase in volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| and peak velocities compared to normal flatter developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| These increased volumes and higher peak velocities are producing increased flooding levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| and increased pollution in the channel by channel and bank erosion compared to flatter lowland areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3017)|
| 0:50:26| Increased density on hillside slope further magnifies these hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| Directly below this project, flooding is a great concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| Babley Road has already been blocked by floodwaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Within a half mile further on downstream down this watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| structural flooding has recently occurred because of Rushland Park, a hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| There is also a great asset directly below this development, a large headwater springs that starts Woods Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3053)|
| 0:51:02| This asset could be used in the future as an alternative source of water plus many other aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| but this asset could be easily damaged or destroyed by this development's runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| These hillside development hazards has forced EPA to come to Knox County, even in this watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3077)|
| 0:51:27| EPA this month has sent Rushland Park a corrective action order because of its inability to handle their runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3087)|
| 0:51:37| from their hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Today is a brand new day in Knox County because of the MS4 requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| Responsibility and liability have been transferred from the single developer to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3107)|
| 0:51:55| for damages and drainage problems that are created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Fines and costly improvements can be passed on to the taxpayers to fix these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| I'll reserve any time I've got left for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| All right, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Mr. Seymour, you've got four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| I'm not going to take four minutes, Mr. Chairman, but, members of the commission, all I can do is rely on facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| All I can do is present a letter from the fire chief at Rural Metro who says there is fire service available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3144)|
| 0:52:34| from several locations to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| This property is in the Woods Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| That's what our engineers tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| It's not in First Creek or Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| It's in the Woods Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Our sewer goes to Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| These are facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| This is not a hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| This is a development on rolling land in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| We don't have much tabletop land, but it is certainly not a hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| And I would welcome anybody to look at topographic maps, examine the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| Mr. Johnson and Mr. Donaldson have noted what the sector plan says about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| We're just trying to deal with facts, and we're happy to deal with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| And we think the facts support a rezoning in accord with MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| We've got, it looks like someone else is wanting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Commissioner, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Let's hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| You'll have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| It's 513.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| My name is Albert Bean, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| My father bought a piece of land that is right next to where this development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| He's been there 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| He has never had a neighbor inside of his house in 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| Now we're going to put 300 houses right next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| Anyway, that watershed that everybody is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| I used to explore that land as a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| And the section running towards Babley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| there's a big ditch there that transports the water out of there that ends up in the Woods Creek watershed he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| It goes down Harris Road, I reckon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Anyway, in the spring, there's a wet weather creek that runs down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3271)|
| 0:54:40| And the water table is right up to the top of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| There's an old cistern there we used to look in, and it would fill all the way to the top in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| And all this water goes down Harris Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| and they're already having flooding down there coming in from the Saddlebrook subdivision that's right next to Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3292)|
| 0:55:01| on the middle part between Millertown and Babley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| And I don't know if anybody has ever tried to make a left turn to Washington Pike at the end of Harris Road during school time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3306)|
| 0:55:18| at about 7.30 to 8 o'clock to 8.30 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| because you have to let somebody in because the traffic is backed up further than there already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3322)|
| 0:55:32| all the way down to Rita School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| And the Murphy Road light is the same story at that time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| And so is the next light down where you turn to get on to 640 on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Mr. Seymour, you've got two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| I think we're back where we were when we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| What kind of development do you want for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Continued unplanned development or do you want a planned development with a good developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| We ask that you approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Okay, Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| I do have a question for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Approximately how much of this area is trees right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| About a third of it, mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Not really dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Yeah, about a third of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| And with your development that you're thinking about, what percentage of the trees do you plan to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Can you predict that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| That would be hard, but you've got a new ordinance, I think, that was passed on second reading today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| a tree ordinance that we will certainly have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| The developers I've been working with, and, Mr. Schubert, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| go in and tie off the trees that can be saved and used and protect those because trees sell homes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3420)|
| 0:57:11| There's no clear cutting of property anymore like there was at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Eighth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| I don't think it comes as a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| I'd like a motion that we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| I must say that both sides have done their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| You know, being one of the younger commissioners, I've got to meet a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| One of those people is Doug Irwin sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| He's been very informative to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Mr. Schubert, I've not got to meet, but his reputation stands as very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| I can tell you two guys that Arthur Seymour has been a real advocate for this project, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| And I had hopes maybe that this could be worked out because I've had both direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| and indirect from both sides, the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| and since I had hoped that maybe something could be worked out or breached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| but evidently we've reached the point that it can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| that I have not really been able to advise a little bit of the sunshine law and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| But one of the things that really strikes me with Mr. Seymour and what we're going to have out in district eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3502)|
| 0:58:31| we're still a fragmented but one body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| We're the largest land mass, as everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| But you still have distinct places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| Riverdale, Ramsey, Asbury, places you don't hear of, Three Points, High Top, Four Way Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| And lots of these people, we can go to Thorn Grove, the Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| This has been only second to Midway Road with the number of people that has contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| With the promise of 4,000 jobs, this same type of promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| then it still doesn't sit well with people in Thorn Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| As we look around the room here, many of you are not exposed to, it's not a lifestyle, it's a way of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| If we're out west, maybe in the fast developing areas of Carnes, then you move in 50, 100 homes, 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| you look out your window and you say, hey, I've got a new neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Where these people live here, you look out your window and say, hey, I've got 350 new neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3570)|
| 0:59:38| It doesn't bode well with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| You have the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| We see this about the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| You've heard of environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Mark Harmon's been out there, other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| And they, this doesn't really appear to be suited to the people that live in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| And I don't want to get too scientific here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| I know should it go forward, it may be an okay thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| But, like I said, it is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| People are at a slower pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| This is developing at its own pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| As I understand it, there's 3,000 units are growing on the, I call it, the Gibbs side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| We've got 1,000 on the Carter side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| This place is not stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| You know what we have at Weibull's Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| We've got a good development of Mr. Jarnagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| and probably something is going to go on the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| And, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| And then when you build one, I don't know where you're switching dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| from one side of the road or town to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| People are wanting to move out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| And, in fairness, two-and-a-half acres, two-and-a-half units is not a bad thing under a lot of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3646)|
| 1:00:54| And because sewer is not out there, they're going to have to have this type of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| to make it a successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| In this particular situation, then the only thing that I can do is stand for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| I'm going to vote no, and I'm going to ask that each one of my commissioners support me in that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| I'd like to bring the alternative measure that we approved this per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Both items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Second by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Did we not get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| There's already a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Yeah, but he did a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Okay, so we vote on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| And I want to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Two-and-a-half units per acre is very low density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| I've driven through a lot of Mr. Schubert's subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| They're really attractive subdivisions with $200,000 on up to $300,000 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| You know, we're not talking condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| We're talking nice single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| They're going to be bringing in sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| They're going to be bringing better fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| And for the folks that live in this area, I understand sometimes it looks scary when things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| I mean, I know there's someone out in that area that wants to put in a cellular tower at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| and a lot of the neighbors are really raising cane about the cellular tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| And, of course, I don't think that comes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| I think that goes before the FCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| But the thing is cellular phones are a part of our life these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| and if you're going to have cellular phones, you're going to have a cellular tower occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| And if folks keep having babies, they're going to grow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| they're going to want to live in a nice single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| And to do that, you've got to have sewer, and you've got to have developments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| Now, I know I'm very familiar with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| My physician is not very far from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| And when I drive through there, what I see is I see a lot of farms that, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| they're not going to be able to remain farms forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| There is no money in small family farms anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| And by developing and by bringing in utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| what we're allowing is we're allowing these family farmers to be able to sell their land at a reasonable rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| so that they can retire from a business that they can't make a living at anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| And as someone who comes from a district that has seen a lot of these nice developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| it's not the end of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| What I found in the Powell community when it developed is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| we were a little worried about it when I was in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| When I was a young man, I thought, what are we going to do with all these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Subdivisions popping up left and right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| But what I found out was that a lot of fine folks moved to my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| We have nice stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| We have nice restaurants now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| And I couldn't imagine a better place to live than the Powell community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| And I think you're going to find that this type of development is going to make your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| It's going to enrich your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| And I think that a decade from now when this is built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| you're going to think it was one of the greatest things that ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Well, you know, just maybe to point out the office obvious is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| One that's been brought out is in 2005, this same piece of property did not get by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| Probably, I don't know, there are six that would have been on the commission at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| Maybe some of you are sitting around here today that voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| I don't know of anything that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Becky Lombar is on the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| She lives within miles of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| She is strongly against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| And part of it has to do with the sector plan, the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| And here again, you know, and Mr. Lambert has made some good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| but I don't think those points override the prevailing need of the community nor my observance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| and I still will ask for your no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| I'd just like to make a correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| In 2005, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Seymour will know this better than myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| was it not three units per acre that was asked for then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| So this is actually not the same proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| This is a new proposal that calls for lower density that's more compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Commissioner Ballard, I totally respect you and you fighting for your community there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| but what scares me, and I've been out to see this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| if this two-and-a-half units per acre with underground utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| and sewer brought up to service this property, if this is not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| and we go back to one unit per acre, Mr. Seymour, what will be done with this property then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| It will probably be sold off in pieces or however we can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| It will not be developed as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| It will be a trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Is that on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| Mr. Schubert and Mr. Irwin would not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| However, we cannot control what the buyers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| And I assume it would just be parceled up and sold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| That's why I seconded your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I mean, if you go up and look at this property, it's a gorgeous piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| You know, you're under three-and-a-half miles from East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| You know, you're right next to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| It's a great piece for development, controlled development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| You know, you're not commercial out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| You're residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| So you're not impeding on residential homes with commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| But that's what I was scared of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| To take this piece of property and to piecemeal it out or to possibly have a mobile home park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| it would be atrocious because this could be a very nice subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| And that's what I was scared of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| And that's why I was going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| I didn't want to see it to do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Underground utilities, sewer being brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| It's doing something to this part of the community that it's kind of been left behind for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| I reject the notion of inevitability about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| I think people in that community organize for a purpose because they love their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| They see the qualities in it that Commissioner Ballard spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| So I don't think there's anything inevitable about a sprawling growth out here, trailer park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| or any other threatened alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| We are here because we're elected officials, because we're here to listen to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| and I hope we will listen to you as a neighborhood organized around a reasonable idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| I think this is the reason we have urban growth boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| and I think that is reason enough that we should respect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| and uphold our own urban growth boundary and deny this zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4097)|

| 1:08:19| Mr. Donaldson, you guys are the professionals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| In your opinion, is this a good project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| Well, we make recommendations to the commission based on the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| which says that you, the legislative body, may approve low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| if it's an extension of either the urban growth area or the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| That is the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| It is an extension from the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Utilities will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| They'll have to do a traffic study, and they're using the planned residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| which allows us that second look at a project through approval of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| At that time, all of the details will become available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| They'll be available to the public at a public hearing at the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4150)|

| 1:11:49| First two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| First two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| First two are appeals by WC Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| The first is for MPC's denial of a northwest county sector plan amendment from LDR Low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| Density Residential and SLPA Slope Protection Area to C Commercial and SLPA Slope Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| The second is for MPC's denial of rezoning from PR Plan Residential to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| They're located on the south side of Hardin Valley Road, east side of Thompson Road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4336)|

| 1:12:19| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Had a little bit of a problem about getting contact made with the neighborhood representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| on this, and I would request postponement until your July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| Motion to postpone until our next monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4357)|

| 1:12:51| Next two, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| These are appeals by Walt Dixon, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| The first is for MPC's denial of northwest county sector plan amendment from MU Mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| Uses Limited to Old Office and MDR Medium Density Residential to Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| The second is for MPC's denial of rezoning from A Agricultural and OA Office Park to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| They're both located on the north side of Middlebrook Pike, northwest of Albany Road in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I'm Walt Dixon, 9052 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Let's get an MPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Commissioners, as was read into the record, this is a request for a sector plan change from Mixed Use Limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| to Office and Medium Density Residential to Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| The rezoning is rezoning from A Agricultural and OA Office Park to CA General Business property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| It includes approximately 2.16 acres located on the north side of Middlebrook Pike, northwest of Albany Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4432)|
| 1:14:01| Based primarily on the sector plan amendment and, excuse me, the sector plan designation currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| and the fact that you have a commercial node right there at the intersection of, I believe that's Joe Hinton Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4449)|
| 1:14:18| and Middlebrook Pike, and the fact that we feel like office would serve as a good transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4458)|
| 1:14:27| or a good buffer, especially if you tried to extend back to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| The fact that already two of the lots out of the three lots are already zoned for OA office development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| The staff recommended approval of extending that office by one lot to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| However, they did recommend denial of the commercial designation and commercial expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| Having said that and having made that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| the Planning Commission listened to all the testimony brought out at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| and voted to deny the entire application outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| So that's the reason the application has been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| And, again, the Planning Commission by a 12-0 vote voted to deny commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| and deny CA General Business for the entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Mr. Dixon, you have up to five minutes, and it's 534.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4516)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| We're requesting CA on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| What we would like to build here is a neighborhood restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| Some of you all might remember when me and my company operated Smoky Mountain Farm Beef Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| and Steakhouse at 952 Middlebrook several years ago from the mid-'80s to the early-'90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| We'd like to duplicate that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| We originally sold it in the early-'90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| We had a lot of irons in the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| We've regretted it ever since we sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| It did real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| It was a neighborhood restaurant, a true neighborhood place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| I've lived and worked in this area all my adult life right here within a mile of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| And we need a neighborhood restaurant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| I think that it blends in with the staff recommendation of being somewhat of a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And I'd like to show you why I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| I've made a little larger drawing and colored it up of what you have in your packet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| The orange here is the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| It fronts right on the Middlebrook arterial highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| Pink is already commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| This is a Pilot and a McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| It's within rock-throwing distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| To the east is a Weigel's and then a communication thing across the street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| Further to the west, Mr. Weigel owns this corner, although it's undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| He plans to develop it soon, he told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Holrob has the next piece, which is to be a bank and a strip center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| When you go further here, the yellow is West Park Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| which is a huge tract of land that they're working on now developing for church uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| Then you get down to some more commercial here, which is Car Wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| This is a sandblasting company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I'm not sure what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| And this is Middlebrook Gardens, a marriage party-type place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| The dark green here is a high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| This is Eagle Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Courtyard's at Eagle Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| We'll take the blame for building those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| There's about 550 apartments there that back-route up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| The people I sold them to are not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| They would like to have walking access to get to a restaurant like we gave them here when they did on the Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4667)|
| 1:17:56| Across the street is condominiums, high-density, also here and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| And we're looking here at one of the most densely populated areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| The traffic studies at the corner of Johanton and Middlebrook are absolutely awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| I think, without a doubt, we can blend in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| The other things we built on Middlebrook can blend it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| Ms. Mauer here is against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| I regret that very much because I've had the pleasure in the past of working with her on numerous issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| on which we were on the same side, including, if you'll remember, the red light there at Johanton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| which we'll always appreciate her help on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| And this time we're bumping heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| We certainly have no other uses in mind except the restaurant that we'd operate ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| And I'd like to point out we have no traffic issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| We're on our total highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| We have no drainage issues other than the property would have to be filled some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| But we do have drainage easements across these apartments to the 10-mile drainage here, which solve those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| I think if we look at it from the long point of view, I took the liberty on this other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| Again, we're orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Here's going west, the pink's commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Get down to Cedar Bluff, it's a massive commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| There's commercial already scattered all up and down Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| The property we have contains three old broken-down rental houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| They don't look very good now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| I think a neighborhood restaurant would look better and, like I said, be a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| And we'd appreciate it if you all would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Commissioner Norman, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| No, I just want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| Ms. Maurer, go ahead, and then I'll ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| It's 539.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| If you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Sue Maurer, 8824 Farmington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I'm here today as president of Crestwood Hills Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| also representatives from West Hills and also from Cedar Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| I handed in petitions earlier today from people in these areas that are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| It's not that we're against Walt Dixon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| but we do feel that this does not fit into the development area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| He built a lot of those homes, apartments, and condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| but there's a lot that have been built since that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| This is a scenic highway as of April 16, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| At that time it was designated certain areas would be residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| and certain places would be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Now, from that car wash, West Knox Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| all the way down on that side of the road except for Pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| which has a McDonald's in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| all the way down to Piney Church Grove is all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| On the other side from Roderick Road all the way down to Shannondale Nursing Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| except for a Wiggles that is already there at Gallaher is all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| This does not fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| This is taking a development and putting it into a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| which is residential, has been for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| This is destroying that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| There are certain restrictions for scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| and this does not fit into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| I'm sorry, but I hope that you will deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| My name is A.B. Harden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| I live at 713 Westboro Road, past president of West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| Joe Fury could not be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| but we are interested in keeping Middlebrook Pike a scenic highway as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| And Mr. Fury wrote you all a letter, and I'll just read part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| The design of Middlebrook Pike with a central grassy medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| was intended to restrict cross-traffic turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| The Middlebrook Pike Curricular Study endorsed by Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| and County Commission recommended that commercial zoning be restricted to selected intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4928)|
| 1:22:16| The properties in question are not at an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| The same study expressed concern about development of stripped commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| because of its negative impact on adjacent residential communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| which is a prevalent character of the surrounding land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Granted, commercials on these parcels would create a series of commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| extending eastern from Joe Hinton Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| These would, without a doubt, impact the residential parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| and could lead to further creep of commercials throughout additional residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| Bob Brennan, 8621 Flagstone Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| I'm on the Board of Directors of Cedar Grove Condominium Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| We had 49 of our residents to sign a petition opposing this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| And as far as any contingency issue, we got the greatest turnout for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| With this area being designated as a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| we would request the commissioners to deny this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| and support a residential development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Anybody else wish to speak against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Mr. Dixon, you've got up to three minutes left to rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| Well, I would like to rebut a bit of what Sue said about the commercial on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| Again, all the pink you see is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| That's a small scale, less than a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| Here's a larger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| So there's quite a bit of commercial on both sides of the road down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| The other thing I'd say is what we plan to build will be scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| I think our last restaurant we had was scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| This one we plan to be a lot more scenic because it's two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| It gives us a little more to do something with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| I also want to reemphasize what I said about transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| I agree with what's been said here that this area is in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| And I personally don't think that a little bit more commercial here next to commercial we already have violates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5071)|
| 1:24:42| The look that we have now currently is unattractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| What we would build and blend into the commercial almost next door to us where the pilot is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| and surrounded by our former apartments, we would try to create, not destroy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| I'd also like to point out that West Hills is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Of course, we're in the county, and this is a county issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| And I appreciate y'all's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Does the opposition wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| On his map, he may show some of these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| They are not built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| He has property right now on these lots that he is talking about as homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| He has been running these as homes to various people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| And this is not all commercial all through there, as he states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| I mean, anybody can take their car and drive up and down through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| and see that there's only commercial like there at Joe Hinton Road, which is a pilot gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| which I can tell you Mr. Dixon owned that property at one time, and he sold that to pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| Beyond that, there is nothing else on that side all the way down to Piney Church Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| On the other side, as I stated, the only commercial over there on that side is the Waggles at Gallagher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| All the way back up to Roderick Road is all residential with either apartments, condos, or homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5165)|
| 1:26:14| So I certainly hope that you will deny this and realize what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| We're trying to keep this a scenic highway and trying to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| So give your name again just so they can have it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5185)|

| 1:26:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you for your help today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Mr. Chairman, a question for Mr. Dixon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Unless I'm mistaken, you cannot have a median cut on a scenic highway, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| We weren't planning to ask for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| So if you're coming east on Middlebrook, you'll go on up to the intersection and turn around and come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| Or are you going to have an entrance behind Pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| No, no entrance behind Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Now, that is a possibility for the future, but not at this time, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| But there won't be a median cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| We're not going to ask for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| I would move to deny upholding the MPC decision and deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| We've got to get a second first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Commissioner Huddleston seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Commissioner Catewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| Get your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| I did want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| It was my understanding that a scenic highway just means that there's no billboards on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Can anyone tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| In my read of the state legislation, there are two references to land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| One is the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| The other is a prohibition against junkyards, I think is the term that's used in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5291)|
| 1:28:21| Those are the only two that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| I think you also have certain height requirements to the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| I don't have the code section with me, but there are other requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| And so long as Mr. Dixon were to be involved in constructing in accordance with that, it would be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5312)|
| 1:28:42| But there are heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| I've had conversations with Ms. Maurer about this before related to the pilot station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| But there are sign restrictions and there are height restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| For instance, you may not be able to have more than one sign and certain square footage for the entire piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| So there are a number of considerations that Mr. Dixon would need to consider, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5343)|
| 1:29:13| before he were to construct something on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Okay. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Ms. Maurer, just for the sake of a little bit of history, on the site where the pilot is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| and that was sold by Mr. Dixon, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| Would you address that just for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| The point being, in my travels of Middlebrook Pike, and I don't mean to offend anybody in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5374)|
| 1:29:43| certainly the Haslam family, it's a great family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| but I can't imagine anything more garish and offensive than that particular structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5385)|
| 1:29:56| And so I was just curious, how did that come about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| and how did that get by your group and your neighborhood associations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| First of all, no one knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| That's how it all happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| The next thing we found out that they were putting in a request for a digital type of sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| and that's when we became involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| At that point, we did not know anything about a pilot gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| At this point, right now, I have to tell you that pilot oil is still in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| and Mr. Owens, I think, knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| I have been working with John Gill with the law department there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| and they are still in violation, and, of course, the attorneys have agreed that this is going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| But there are certain things that you have to do if you're on a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| the setbacks, the height, and all these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| The pilot has done part of the things that are required, but they have not done all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| and they do have to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| And as I understand, they will have to conform to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| If we had known about the gas station, I assure you, we certainly would have done something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| We would have been down here fighting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| And I appreciate Mr. Dixon's idea for a restaurant, and certainly the type of restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5472)|
| 1:31:19| I was aware of the one that he built before, and I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| However, I'm going to have to recommend being the commissioner from the third district to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5484)|
| 1:31:32| I do have one other question for Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| On the MPC recommendation, the vote was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| Twelve to zero on the plan amendment, twelve to zero on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Okay, twelve to zero on both to deny by your organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| And I would like to make the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| There's already a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Oh, my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| So I'll get to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Can I say something about the McDonald's issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Mr. Mayor, I'm not aware of what conversations you may have had with General Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| But under the statute, the district attorney is charged with the responsibility of petitioning a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5534)|
| 1:32:21| to remove a nonconforming use on a state scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| So that's the process I think that you're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| Would you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Substitute motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5554)|
| 1:32:43| Motion to approve the appeal on both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| A yes vote would be in favor of Mr. Dixon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| A no vote would be in favor of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| We'll start in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5586)|

| 1:33:25| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5607)|

| 1:33:29| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| I vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Does anybody else wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| We had nine ayes and eight noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| So we're on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| It's been defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| The zoning passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| It failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| It needed a ten-person majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| It needed ten people, and you had nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| I thought it just took a majority of the folks that were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| It takes ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5661)|

| 1:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| Next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| These are appeals by Robert G. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| Thanks for y'all's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| These are appeals by Robert G. Campbell for Johnson & Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| The first is for MPC's denial of north county sector plan amendment from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| low-density residential, to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| The second is for denial, MPC's denial of rezoning from PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| from 1 to 5 dwelling units per acre to PR plan residential at up to 7.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| They're located on the west side of Griffith Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| north side of Andersonville Pike in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Let's get an MPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| Again, these are two requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| One for a north county sector plan amendment from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| low-density residential to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| And with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| you have a companion rezoning request to increase the density of property that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| zoned plan residential at 1 to 5 dwelling units per acre to 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| This is property that contains approximately 3.56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| It's located on Andersonville Pike at the intersection of Griffith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5759)|
| 1:36:07| One of the best things I can do to show the case that the staff presented to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5767)|
| 1:36:14| and in support of their recommendation of denial is for you to look at your zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| If you look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| nothing shows up on the map that's even remotely approaching medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| This is a very solid, stable, density-wise, low-density residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5788)|
| 1:36:35| Densities range from one dwelling unit per acre to one to up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5795)|
| 1:36:44| So you already have the established pattern in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| You even have multifamily development or non-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| or attached residential development that's developed at one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| So the issue here, I think, is density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| The Planning Commission saw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| The staff was aware of this and felt like that a change to up the density was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| So in both cases, for the plan amendment and the rezoning, the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| the Planning Commission voted unanimously 11 to 0 to deny both requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5833)|
| 1:37:21| Okay, Mr. Campbell, it's 5.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| The piece of property we're looking at currently is a subdivision that's already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| It's got roads, water, sewer, gas, electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| The entire infrastructure is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| That property has been sitting vacant now for approximately two years, maybe a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| The reality is what we want to go in and do is build a single-story condominium development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5864)|
| 1:37:52| abutting around this, the roadway system and everything that's already in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| based on different factors in order to get the economics to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| That's where we're asking for the extra units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| MPC in their analysis factored in, in my opinion, one factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| and that was did this density fit in with the density of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| Obviously, it's residential to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| They also use a lot of other tools in their tool belt when they go look at compatibility of a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| You look at slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| You look at access, utilities, a lot of different things that are analyzed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| If you've been out to Andersonville Park, this area obviously runs by Halls Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| There's a couple of nursing home type things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| There's a subdivision or two, a condominium development, a couple of churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| Something that you would look in, when you look at it just on a face value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| would be able to go with a little higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| So that's the reason we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| We're not trying to do something that would be out of favor with what's going in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| We're, again, proposing single-story condominium units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| whose price range would be somewhere around the $130,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| They would be a duplex unit, so two units together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| We like the fact, again, you can argue back and forth on whether there's going to be too many here, too many there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| I've always come down on the side that if a piece of property is already set up to do as many as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| do as many as you can because, in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| you may be saving another piece of property that we've had a lot of discussions about with slopes and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| You may be able to not have to do that one because the demand may not be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| So this property has already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Again, roads, curb, everything that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| We would just like to take the density up a little higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| It's an extra anywhere from seven to nine units from what's allowed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| So we'd appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| It's 5.59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| David Vandenberg, 40.05 Cletus Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| I'm speaking on behalf of the Villas of Cedar Crossing with the adjacent development to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| I distributed to you all, and a few of you all probably did not get this, my printer ran out of ink, some pictures of stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6020)|
| 1:40:30| And we agree with MPC staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| It's out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| But, more importantly, there's a serious stormwater issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| This piece of property has always served as a drainage area for a very large watershed up Griffith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| That's been substantiated by Knox County stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| And you can see in the upper left corner this, without any houses on this piece of property, this is what we're getting on our property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6049)|
| 1:40:59| The picture next to it, the gravel area, is the sinkhole that this water is draining towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| It's full of gravel because Knox County filled it with gravel December 13th, which was not the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| The water comes around and it's going into two 24-inch culverts to go underneath Andersonville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| and going into an unnamed tributary and eventually into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| You can see the amount of stormwater there and the amount of sediment that's coming from their property on the subsequent pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6084)|
| 1:41:35| And these pictures were taken this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| You know the amount of rain that we've had, which is very, very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| And there's already this much problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| With seven and a half units per acre and all the impervious surface and additional runoff, this would be a catastrophe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6103)|
| 1:41:52| Knox County filled the sinkhole because it is so near Andersonville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| there's a potential it could undermine Andersonville Pike and the road cave-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| So we would appreciate your consideration to deny this rezoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6120)|
| 1:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Is there any other opposition wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Mr. Campbell, you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| In regard to sinkholes and this, that, and the other, the Cedar Crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| the area beside this subdivision is a detention pond that serves Cedar Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| And the water that does come in here comes and goes under Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| We are not adding any more into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| There's an existing detention facility on site of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| One could argue that being left undeveloped, and I'm not going to say this is the entire reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| but there are obviously some areas that do not have a grass stand and different things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| To be left developed would, in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| should help the erosion and silt control because you get the ground cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| you get whatever is on top of it to be able to control the siltation and erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| We, in the design of this, the property was over-detained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| The amount of water coming down was over-detained at the request of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| And certainly, if there's any other remediation that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| we would have to do that on a use-only review time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Buzz, in your opinion, I mean, he's correct that the roads are in, the curbs are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| and some pipes are sticking up, went up there and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| What would it take to make this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| What would be the density, if any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| I mean, I don't think, the way it is now, I don't think it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| But if somebody's invested some money, I mean, is there a way that somebody can get something out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| I mean, put a few in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Is it just density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Is that the main issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| You know, that's primarily what we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Now, in terms of economics, you know, what people say they think they can do or can't do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| that's somebody else to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| We have to look at it from what we feel is the impact on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| When you look at the map, you know, there's nothing in the area that's compatible with this type of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| When you go from LDR to MDR, you're getting into a whole different level of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| Once you approve this, you have some larger tracks in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| And so it may begin to begin a cycle or a transition to more dense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| than really should be there because this is kind of the, you know, a crack in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| The door, you know, then has an easy chance of opening up for higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| We just think, we just felt like it was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| We think there's reasonable use of the property now as in a manner that's similar to how the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| around the area is being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| And as I mentioned before, you do have apparently an attached development that shows up on this map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| that is at plan residential at one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| Can we do that, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Can we change density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| We'll do that best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| I mean, make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| Or does it got to go back for you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I would think that you could probably recommend anything between five and 7.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| or you could recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| I think, John, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| I think you could recommend anything less than 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| But you have to change it to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| Well, he could keep it at MDR at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| If you go five or less, then it would be LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| And that's what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| You mean five or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| It's LDR now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| If you do six or 7.5, it becomes MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| MDR, okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| Mr. Campbell, do you have any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| Well, I'm just saying kind of what Buzz was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| If you approve anything more than five, it's MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| And MDR is their basic reason for not wanting to, as they call it, opening up the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| But every property has got constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| and every property stands on its own as far as what you look at from a density standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| I mean, you've just had this discussion in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Certain properties have certain densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| There are certain reasons for certain densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| And, you know, to say that it opens the door, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| this subdivision has been here for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| and I use the word subdivision because that's basically what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| And to me it's unique among just a vacant piece of property that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| that you're looking at for the first time in a, you know, in its virgin state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| Senator, if you're going to comment on that, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| Well, I would like to rebut what Mr. Campbell said about the drainage and the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6420)|
| 1:47:07| The runoff, this existing runoff from the watershed up Griffith Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| is deflected on our property because of the detention pond for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| It diverts it and it comes over on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| So, you know, we're still going to be dealing with all that stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| that does not go into their detention pond at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| It diverts directly on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Then whenever you put impervious surface on there, you're going to greatly increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| One of the pictures does not show their detention pond, but it does show the discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| So if it fills up and runs over, it still comes over on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| So, you know, seven and a half units would greatly exasperate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| The first comment that Tracy Jones, who's a soil scientist with Knox County Stormwater, made was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| this property should have never been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| You know, this was an area of biofilter that was naturally there that absorbed all this water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| Once it was cleared, even with no structures there, now we're getting all this runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| and it's going in the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| And sinkholes with water pouring in them get bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Buzz, how can he put his water on their thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| How could that have happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| How did that get approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Buzz, can you address the pictures, the photos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| You have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| I'll just let you look at them for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| At the same time, let me ask Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| Mr. Campbell, will you address the photos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| Are those your silt fences and structures that have failed there in the photos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| Potentially, those silt fences are probably a couple years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| so I don't know exactly what the limitation is from the upkeep of the original owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| I can't address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| But it is very possible, yes, sir, that that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| The drainage ditch, the water was picked up upstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| diverted into a ditch that goes behind the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| That ditch leads directly into two 24-inch pipes that go under Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| The villas that the gentleman was speaking about, there's our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| there's a detention pond, and then there's their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| It's not like we're putting water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| I think the insinuation is the water is going into their property, into their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| However, it's going into a detention area that's below their houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| and then going under the road into a drainage way that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| So we're here, they're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| and then there's a pond area that's back here where the pipe comes underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Buzz, can you kind of solve the conflict a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| or shed some light on what you think about where water is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| and whose water it is and so on and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| If I were a hydrologist, I'd be more than happy to try to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| I think, you know, whatever has happened is above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| and beyond what we can approve here today in terms of rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| That's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| In terms of how you handle drainage, grading, access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| those are the kinds of things you deal with at the second step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| which would be use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| and that's where we rely on expertise from the applicant as well as the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| Whatever is put in place on the property to mitigate runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| construction techniques to hold runoff back, silt fences, all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| that is above and beyond the zoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| Now, we try to identify potentially those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| so that you either deny a request based upon those potential issues based upon experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| or you have a red flag there or something that you address at the development plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6661)|
| 1:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| And, Mr. Campbell, then, if this was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| would you go back and address some of these issues, and if so, how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| Well, if it were denied, first of all, this piece of property is being bought by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| I'm representing a person that is trying to buy this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| So he's buying it from somebody who owns it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| and so I have no ability or the person that's trying to purchase it to go back to that person and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| hey, you need to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Obviously, if we bought the piece of property, then when ownership changes hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| and the plan has to be developed, then there is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Because I don't know if bonds have run out on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| I don't know if the county's mechanism for being able to take care of this has run its course or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| I just don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Campbell, you've done a lot of drainage work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| Do you feel confident you can handle the drainage off of this site and contain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| Again, we've got a pond that's on this site already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| Is it going to be large enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| We have to go back and do the hydraulics again based on the new conditions that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| This gentleman has got some pictures, and those pictures show definitely some water that's coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| The best I could tell looking at the drainage, and, again, I've not done a detailed look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| is the water is coming from upstream down along Griffith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| It's coming behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| There's a pipe that comes under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| It's going into a ditch behind the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| and then it's going fairly immediately into the drain system that goes under the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| There may be some other things going on upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| There may be some things going on on that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| but if it comes to meeting the drainage standards, I don't have any problem with whatever we design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| We'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6777)|
| 1:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| I guess it's back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| Buzz, do we need to go back to the drawing board on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Because Mr. Campbell does what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| I mean, 12 to nothing is a pretty strong vote from 11 to nothing is pretty strong from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| And I want the man to be able to develop his property and be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| And Mr. Campbell, I have confidence that he can put water where water needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6804)|
| 1:53:32| What do you guys recommend that it would be a win for everybody, if not, or does it just need to be turned down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6812)|
| 1:53:39| Well, Commissioner, I guess at this point I'm not sure what we're going to do differently in taking it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6819)|
| 1:53:48| I think our recommendation is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| We would recommend that the more appropriate density is five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| Can you live with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| It's currently at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| So, basically, if we could live with that, we wouldn't be here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| Let me clarify, make sure you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| It's already planned residential at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| He's asking to increase that to 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| Can you live with that, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| No, we're very much opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| There's no way to solve this drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| Well, it's got to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| It's not about reducing the density of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Hey, David, if you'll come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| The only way that you can solve this drainage issue would be to reduce the density of development, not to increase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| This water does not go into the detention pond on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| The detention pond on this site retains the water that comes off the roads and the storm drains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| that were put in for the original subdivision development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| This is not that water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| And where he's talking about it comes across to the culverts under Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| That's on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| It's being deflected directly on our property towards the sinkhole that you can clearly see by those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| He's asking for 7.5 and Buzz is saying move it down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| Already at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| Leave it at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| David, where do you live to this proposed development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Our next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Yes, beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| This runs the length of one side of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| Where do you face Andersonville Pike or do you face your house on Griffith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| My house is on Cletus Way, which is the entrance road to the Villas of Cedar Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| It comes off of Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| The end of my road cul-de-sacs right at this where you see those pictures, where the silt fence has failed, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6942)|
| 1:55:51| That's the end of the cul-de-sac of the road I live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| And I'm speaking on behalf of the whole development, all 35 owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| Have you all met, had a meeting with Mr. Johnson or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| I've received a couple of phone calls, but nothing from Mr. Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| We've answered and I've talked to the people that I've received phone calls from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| You know, I don't know if there's anything that you all can work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| or if Mr. Johnson could come down on his number and live with five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| But I think it's worth you all having some kind of meeting with the people who are concerned before you ask us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=6993)|
| 1:56:47| According to Mr. Vandergriff, there's no solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Well, there may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| There may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| But at least you all have tried before you ask us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| Because it's David and people that have to live out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| and they ought to have the opportunity to meet with the potential developer to see if there's whatever can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| If not, then I guess it's left up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| But I guess my motion, or Larry, you might want to make a motion to postpone it 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| and you all have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| If you want to call me and Commissioner Smith to come out and meet with you, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| If I may properly second any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| One question, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| If, let's say the zoning were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| would Mr. Campbell not have to come to you all with an acceptable plan to contain the water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| He would have to develop a plan that would pass muster of county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| and any new regulations that may be coming about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| But he would have to prepare a plan that met requirements of not scanning engineering primarily and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7065)|
| 1:57:54| If he changes the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Unless what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| The property looks like it's currently platted with 14 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| If he were to propose a change to that, he would have to come through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| But he would basically have to meet the criteria of the new stormwater ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| and try to contain the water on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| I just don't see the need to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| I mean, it's a proposal that MPC voted unanimously to shoot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| It has so many problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| I think we should agree and uphold our own MPC on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| We've got a motion on the floor to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| So it's been postponed 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| If you want to give me and Commissioner Smith a call, we'll be glad to meet with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| Appeal by John King for Bank East of TTCDA decision to limit sign height to eight feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| on approved certificate of appropriateness for sign permit property located on the south side of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| east of Pellissippi Parkway in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| Could I ask a question of Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| Reading through this, what I was looking at is at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| it looks like there was a motion that was made to have the setback in the heighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7175)|
| 1:59:43| And the heighth is less than what you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| Is that kind of summary of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| So do they really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| I don't know that they really deny that, but the motion seemed to be something other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| Maybe you want to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| What was involved was a request for certificate of appropriateness at the Tech Corridor Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| And we asked essentially, I don't know whether they call them waivers or variances, but two waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| One was as to the setback from the right of way of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| and the other was related to the heighth of this ground-mounted monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| They granted, to some degree, our request with regard to the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7226)|
| 2:00:32| We asked for a setback, and they gave us less than we asked for, but we're willing to live with the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7232)|
| 2:00:41| The issue before you is just the heighth of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| They repealed their, in essence, their approval, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| but approval of our request at less than we sought as to the heighth of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7251)|
| 2:01:01| What we have is a sign that is located in the front area of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| Right now it has to be a minimum of 25 feet from the right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| which probably puts it 75, 80 feet or more from the paved portion of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| We asked for 12 feet in heighth, and they gave 8 feet in heighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7282)|
| 2:01:30| In a packet of materials, I think there's some information as to the signage on the adjoining piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| and they have a sign that's at 12 feet in heighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| I've given you a rendering, if you will, of what this sign will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7300)|
| 2:01:47| We would ask for approval of our appeal to give us that certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7307)|
| 2:01:56| for a heighth on the sign of not more than 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7316)|
| 2:02:04| I'm here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| I know that staff to the corridor board had recommended approval of our request to the corridor board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7326)|
| 2:02:16| and we don't know of any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| This is a newly constructed branch bank for Bank East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| and the signage is in sort of a logo fashion that's pretty much typical of all of their locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7346)|
| 2:02:37| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| I think the requirements in some sense, and this has made a lot of sense over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7363)|
| 2:02:51| but I think as this describes this, it doesn't seem unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| In fact, it seems reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Maybe I hear other things, but I'm going to move that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| I don't think it would create harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| This is not a sign that it's going to distract from the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| I'll make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Second by Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| Mr. Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Is there somebody here from TTCDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Oh, yeah, Buzz, you're on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| And I'm the chair of the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| I'm glad we're so well connected in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| Buzz is in the discussion of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| Would you just give me some ---- I didn't read the summary of whatever you've got in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| Well, I don't want to ---- John, I think they did request a 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| I initially looked at 30 feet, but the board felt like the 25-foot setback was very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| And the idea there was that you do have additional land from the actual property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| to where the pavement actually of Hardin Valley Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| So visually you have a very large setback, even though it's not necessarily from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| When I looked at the request, and back when the convenience store next to this property was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7465)|
| 2:04:34| they got a waiver for a 12-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| It was primarily because of being able to catch that use as you got down to the bottom of the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7477)|
| 2:04:45| leading on to Hardin Valley from Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| Also to some degree from traffic coming underneath, coming from the west, going east on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7488)|
| 2:04:56| So that was, in some respects, part of the reason for that 12-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| What I've tried to do as staff is to look at and at least try to begin to maintain some consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| look at any previous waivers that were approved and try to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| The board felt like, and I think it was a point, a very valid point, this property does rise a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| and they felt like with the eight feet that they approved rather than the six and rather than the 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7520)|
| 2:05:27| eight feet would be sufficient for the sign because it does sit up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| It's not a very big rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| But because of the way they've graded the site, it does sit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| So that's why they approved the eight-foot height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| which was somewhat of a compromise between the required six feet and the 12 feet, which the applicant requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7539)|
| 2:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| So what we're approving is an eight-foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| You're approving the 12-foot sign on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| And that's your all's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Eight-foot is our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| That was staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| The board voted for an eight-foot height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| The motion is to, if you will, uphold my appeal and approve a 12-foot up to a 12-foot high sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7566)|
| 2:06:19| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| I would just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Commissioner Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| I would just say that the staff recommendation about the raised elevation is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| And, you know, we don't want to engage in sort of a rolling set of exemptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| where each sign is a little bit higher than the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| And I just don't think that we should be routinely overturning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| when they obviously put some thought into the surrounding elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| and came up with what is a reasonable compromise already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| I would just say I drive through this area probably about once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| It's in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| And I believe that a 12-foot sign would be very compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| You know, this is just down the street from Pellissippi State University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| You know, it's not out of line with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| And, actually, I don't think you'd be able to see the sign where this is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| if you didn't get a little bit of height on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| I think I probably will vote to accept this 12-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| But I would like my fellow commissioners to be aware of signage as a basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| I think a real basic flaw that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| And every roadway we have is covered with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| And it's excessive signs or, no doubt, visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| And I'd just like for us to be aware of that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| I don't see any more lights on, so we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| Mr. Chairman, do you have any authority at DBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| Get some WD-40 down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| There you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| I want to thank everybody for the resolution they passed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| I know that was a hard vote for you, but I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| We've got tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| It was almost real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625?start=7709)|
