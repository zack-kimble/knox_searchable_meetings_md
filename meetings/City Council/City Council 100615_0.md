| 0:01:47| Eight members being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| We have a quorum and I see Mr. Della Volpe's light is already on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| I just pulled over from the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Let's do agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| No, first, do I need a motion for approval of the minutes, which you all have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Yes, I'd like to postpone item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| Mr. Grieve is not here tonight and I think he has a key interest in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| How long of a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| A four-week postponement on 12B, which is the changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| I'm going to make a motion to postpone 11D for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| This is the resolution on the quality growth conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| Yes, that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| There is an item that is the resolution, I guess, that would go 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| And it relates to another item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| And I ask that that be considered along with 9A, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| Yes, the second reading of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| It's better to do that with two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| First motion to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| We say that was a motion to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Without objection, it is added to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| And now a motion to move this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| No, really, a motion now to suspend the rules for 11-0 to be considered in conjunction with, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| We're having a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Anything else to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Any consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| I don't believe we have any marked, but I know there was discussion about doing all the emergency ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Mr. De La Vope, can you make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I'm going to move that we consolidate items for discussion, 12G through S, and make them a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| Those are the 202 grants that are listed on the agenda, and I think we can dispose of those in a summary fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=274)|
| 0:04:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| All those in favor, this would be a motion to add them to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| And now we'll need a motion to adopt the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Or you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| I just want to say, I mean, I should have said this during our review process, but the HEN ordinance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| people have done a tremendous amount of work on this, and I'm just uncomfortable a little bit because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| unfortunately, Councilman Grieve is on the mend, and we miss him not being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| You know, I just, it doesn't feel right to me to move forward with this just simply because it could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| it's an even, you know, you've got eight folks here, and I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| and I know a lot of folks are here in support of it and what have you, but I think that perhaps, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| it could come out not so good for those that were in favor of it and both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| I just, I kind of get a queasy feeling that he's not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| And then, you know, I know it's summertime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| and probably some of the other meetings folks aren't going to be able to be here because folks are going to be on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| So, you know, I want to throw it out there that we postpone this, if I may, 12C, and just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=374)|
| 0:06:25| perhaps there will be some discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| So, I'll make that motion to throw it out there just to kind of see where we're at on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| I need a second for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| I'll go ahead and second it for the purpose of the discussion since there are a lot of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| Let me start with Ms. Palmer, and then I'll just work my way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| I also am heartened to see so many people here on either side of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| and obviously council has received a large amount of correspondence and phone calls, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| Councilman Grieve is watching us as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| He also, when I talked to him this afternoon to see how he was feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| told me that he would send us an evaluation or a critique after the meeting, so we look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| He's having a heart attack over here, but that's all right, don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Just talking about himself, that was all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| But, anyway, he can call Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| He's well aware he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| I think that we should proceed with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| This is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| He will be privy to what is going on by watching on TV, and also the tape is available afterward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| So, I would like to move forward with the first reading and the first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| I agree with those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| I do want to ‑‑I think your point of view has merit, if I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| and that is that one of our colleagues is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| which basically means that it could be a bit of a log jam in terms of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=474)|
| 0:08:01| and that's what I understand your point, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Nothing other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| I think we ought to just proceed, since it is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Mr. De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Yeah, I wonder if I could talk about a variation on a theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| It seems to me that we have people that came out, made arrangements to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| and it's not very easy to park and get here and get to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| I'd like to hear them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Whether we reach the vote or not might be a different question we could take up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| but I really do think that we owe, as a courtesy to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| to hear what they got to say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| And since you said Dwayne is sitting back listening, he won't be uninformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| He'll be informed when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| I just, for my own point, I spoke to Mr. Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| He's comfortable with us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| And I do feel like Mr. De La Vope is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| If we get to a point of being ready to vote and want to decide to postpone so he can be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| But I also know that last summer we didn't have a meeting for the entire summer that all nine were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| I withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Any other items dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| Let me move on to Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Let me start off by saying that the mayor is not here, in case you hadn't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| He is planning to show up at about 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I'm optimistic that we will be finished by then, and he will get to be pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| Three quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| The PetSafe dog park was opened this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| We had, I guess, about 50 people and about 20 dogs out for the ribbon-cutting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| It's now available, thanks to the work of PetSafe and radio systems, down at the corner of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| it's Summit Hill and Central, a wonderful location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Second, I want to announce a business breakfast that the city is hosting Thursday morning from 730 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=596)|
| 0:10:05| This is a breakfast for all the companies interested in learning more about upcoming projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| and opportunities to do business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| It is free, and it is at the Foundry on the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Again, that's Thursday morning, 730 until 11 for business folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| And then two quick announcements on the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| There are two meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| One is, and I believe this is a little more in Mr. Pavlis' area, but it's Monday, the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| 6 o'clock at the South Knox Community Center, a meeting about the variance for the Flennican School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=634)|
| 0:10:43| And that's the 10-year plan will be at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| And then a public meeting continuing the conversations about the 10-year plans on Wednesday, the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| at 6 o'clock at the Dean Hill Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| We'll be discussing the development of the Knoxville and Knox County 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| Again, Wednesday, the 23rd, 6 o'clock at the Dean Hill Recreation Center at 7400 Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| That's the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I'd like to thank all the neighbors in the Westview community who came out last Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| We had 60 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| We had representatives of the city there, including David Massey from Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Robert Moyers, Tom Reynolds, Captain Jones, and they were well-received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| People enjoyed the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Barbara Kelly from CAC really drew a lot of attention and was able to address a number of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| Madeline stopped by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| She had been at another event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| And Pastor Maley and Westview Wesleyan made it available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| But it was a terrific meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And we had so much fun that we're going to have on the August 3rd night out an ice cream social at Westview Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| This Thursday at 6 o'clock at the Square Room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| we're going to have a reception for Knoxville's first Children's Defense Fund Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| I think it was about three or four meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| there were two young women who came and gave a small presentation about what a freedom school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| And it's a very exciting program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Every year, 1,500 to 1,800 servant leaders come into our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| and are trained at the Haley Farm and at the Convention Center to go across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| and operate in about 180 freedom schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| And Knoxville now has its own freedom school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| So Thursday night, everybody who can hear my voice is welcome to come to the Square Room at 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| and enjoy some refreshments and also get a very clear taste of what a freedom school is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| If I could ask you to clarify a bit, because on the second item you gave as the mayor's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| that was a very interesting thing, and I want to make sure I understand it as a newbie on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| but it sounded like this was an opportunity for businesses that might be bidding on projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| somewhere during the course of the year to learn the kinds of things we hope to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| and it's a good business planning tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Could you describe what they do at one of these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| I could give a shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| I don't know if there's anybody from the administration who wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| I think you did a good job of explaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| I've been at one of these, and it is a chance for anybody interested in doing business with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| both to learn how the systems work and to know what's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And I don't know if anybody wants to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Are we talking capital projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| I would assume anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Ms. Rojero is indicating, and Mr. York, either of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| The meeting is an opportunity for people to learn how to do business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| It could be both on capital and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| It's kind of, I guess, a networking opportunity for people to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| and find out what we've got planned for the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| and the procedures that they have to do if they're interested in doing business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| Ms. Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Also, each department who may have an opportunity like this will actually get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| and will go down some of the opportunities that will be presenting themselves based on different projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| or programs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| So it's pretty detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So if you're a small business, this is a chance to learn how to do business with the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| and what kinds of opportunities might be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Something pretty important when the economy is not as healthy as it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Yes, I'd like to say that I want to have my quarterly coffee with the councilmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| June the 26th from 9 to 11 at the Roundup Restaurant on 3643 Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| As I said before, you know, not all folks can make the evening meetings because of shift work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| or whatever reasons, family obligations, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| So I just like to offer myself up for a couple hours from 9 to 11 there at the Roundup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| So come early and have a great breakfast or stay afterwards and have a good lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Roundup is a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| But most of all, just come and feel free to touch me with whatever issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| or anything that you want to talk about that I can help you with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| So it's June the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Yes, I want to thank those persons who did come to the District 6 quarterly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| We did not have a large turnout in numbers, but we had a very good meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| which was held at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| And we're going to try to do a better job with our publicity on our next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| which will be somewhere in the Sutherland Avenue area in the next two to three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Any other reports to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| If not, I think we'll move to ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Ms. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| 9A, an ordinance approving the East County Sector Plan dated February 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| which amends the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Mr. DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| I don't know the proper procedure for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| but I'm wondering if she can also read the caption for 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| if we're going to suspend the rules and talk about both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| And would you like them voted on together or talked on together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| I guess, actually, yours makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Ms. Wilson, go ahead and do 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| 11-0, a resolution expressing limitations upon city council's adoption of the city portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| of the East County Sector Plan and noting council's genuine concern about certain issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| associated with adoption of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Can we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| We've got them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Are there comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I'm concerned that the resolution says what we want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| but the vote that we take tonight will be what the community understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| And personally, I'm concerned about the development of the Midway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| I've had a number of constituents contact me on both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| and I would like to see our existing parks have more tenants before we go to another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1052)|
| 0:17:41| I understand that Midway is not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| We won't be directly impacted with tax revenues, but we will be impacted in some other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| Down the road, if this goes through, there will be expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| and a need to really address the sewage treatment issues for the park that's in the city at that interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| So I'm just very concerned that this is not something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| I appreciate the resolution, but I also know that the headline in the paper will not mention the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| It will be the vote of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, well, and since Dwayne isn't here, he's a co-sponsor of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| I think the intent is to address in part what Ms. Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Now, she did say it's difficult because they are separate instruments and maybe there's confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| but this council was confronted with a sector plan that had a very small percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| maybe five percent of the land base in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| It's 1,700 acres out of 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| We didn't hear very many objections or concerns about the city portion of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| and we thought as we voted on this at least the last time, and maybe that will change at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| that there was no reason for this council to withhold its approval of the sector plan for the East County sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| insofar as it affected that portion that was the land base within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| There is a controversial issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| and I know that everyone here would have strong views and concerns to address on both sides of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| because we all want to see jobs for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| We all want to see a healthy community, but we don't want to see urban sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| and some of us, and I know Dwayne is eloquent about that, that we'd love to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| and Ms. Palmer addressed it, we'd love to see some of the inner city resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| and some of the existing parks developed and promoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| and we've heard I can't imagine anyone in this room that hasn't had dozens and dozens of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| and contacts from citizens who are concerned are we converting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| or damaging the rural land base that's out in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| and we've had even workshops looking at what development tools and what planning tools we have to control that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| but at the end of the day, we end up in a situation where Midway Road is in a county area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| and that commission has to wrestle with that part of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| and we really are sort of beyond our jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| so we're working at least as far as the vote last time on the portion that's within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| This resolution simply goes along with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| and tries to describe that we are not endorsing either Midway Road or the notion of urban sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| and I think everyone here knows that you can build something in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| but before you're done, you have to improve roads, you have to do a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| that take community resources to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| so we're trying to confine ourselves to our jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| and that's the reason for the resolution accompanying the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I would respectfully disagree with Mr. DellaVolpe in that the last time we considered Item 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| we amended it very carefully so that it would be very clear to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| that the piece of the East Knox County Sector Plan that we were approving was only the piece in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| and our ordinance tonight shows that amended language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I feel like 11.0, I have a couple of concerns, not the least of which is that it was added by motion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| and so because resolutions only have one reading, this doesn't really allow time for public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| in terms of this being advertised on the agenda and folks having a chance to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| I think it really borders on deliberation on the merits or the lack thereof of the portion of the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| that's in the county in terms of the language that's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| To me, it feels like it really conveys an opinion of council that may or may not be the majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| and if the purpose is simply to clarify that we are only approving the portion of the plan that's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| then I feel like 9A does that adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| and that we don't need to delve into some gray area that I feel like 11.0 touches on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| Mr. DellaVolpe, and then I'll come to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Two aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| One is we did try to take pains last time when we looked at 9A, which is the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| to say that we are only acting on the portion that includes the land base within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| and several of us, at least myself, and I can only speak for myself, by the time I got home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| I was getting e-mails saying, why did they do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| And the blogosphere was full with comments about what the city was doing in approving the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| and I don't think anyone stopped to look at the parsed language in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| as to that we're only acting on the part in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Now, Ms. Roddy is partly correct, and that is on 11.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| it wasn't available until it came out of the draftsman's hands this evening or sooner, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| but it does at least try to say we are not taking a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| Now, she feels perhaps it goes too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Maybe she'd like to amend the language, but I do feel that 9A, standing by itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| did not give the right message even though we labored to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| So I think we need something in addition to that to make sure we are not taken out of context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| or taken downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I guess just one thought, two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| My sense, I don't have a problem with 11.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| I think it is a resolution that expresses thoughts that we are concerned about things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| and I think we all definitely are concerned about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| It definitely clarifies things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I guess I will say that, Ms. Palmer, I actually think the headline in the paper tomorrow will mention chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| and not Midway Road, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Probably both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Might be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Might be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| It could be a whole front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| But the other question, the other issue I want to bring up, currently we are voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| we have a motion for 9A, and I don't know if anybody wants to combine 9A and 11.0 in a single motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| but we do not have that at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Let's leave them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Let's leave them separate because that addresses Maryland's concern, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| So any other comments on 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| If not, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| All heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Seven ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Now 11.0, which we have read into the record, do I have a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| I'll move that we approve 11.0, which is the resolutions trying to clarify what our actions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| If there is not a second, I will declare that it has died for the lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1497)|
| 0:25:10| 11A, a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Rocky Top Wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| and Spirits relative to its application to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| for a license to approve a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| 11B, a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Warehouse Liquors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| relative to its application to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission to renew its license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| to operate a liquor store in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| 11C, a resolution officially accepting the report of the City-County PBA Parking Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| and endorsing to the mayors of the City of Knoxville and Knox County the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| adopted by that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| This was a joint committee of the county and the city to look at developing some guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| that were equitable across the board for all users who share the City-County Parking Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| I was honored to serve as council's representative on your behalf to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| We also had a citizen representative, Lucille Griffo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Everyone attended with great regularity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| We had representation from the Knoxville Police Department, the Knoxville Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| I think everyone on the committee took their responsibility seriously and considered things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| As you all well know, this is merely a recommendation to both mayors that these policies be adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| and we hope very much that they will take these recommendations into the highest consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| And I'm happy to answer any questions if anyone has some about the process or about the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| that we produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I'd just like to thank Councilman Roddy for her service on that committee, and as all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| of us know that have worked on these committees, it takes a lot of time away from your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| and just really appreciate the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| I'll second Mr. Bailey in thanking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| We appreciate your hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| And if no more discussion, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1652)|

| 0:27:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| 11E, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| and all documents necessary to apply for a grant award of $6,877.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| with the required local match in the same amount from the U.S. Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| to provide funding for replacement of police officers' bullet-resistant vests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| and if such application is approved, authorizing the mayor to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| I just want to make sure we -- I guess we should ask the chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| but we are going to be putting a 50% match of about $1,600 in this program, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Mr. Vice Mayor, I'd like to acknowledge your work in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| to outfit all the police officers with bulletproof vests and working with Chief Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| and this goes back years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| And unfortunately, it goes back to an officer being shot, which is something we want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| No more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| 11F, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| and all documents necessary to apply for and accept a grant award of $113,472| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| from the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| for continued funding of the Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Mr. De La Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I wonder if the Chief could fill us in a little bit about the shooting we had recently this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| That was a truly sad thing to read about in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| And here we're talking about gun crime and gun safety, and we have a drive-by shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Is there anything you can tell us about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| and whether we'll have some way of dealing with that mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| that people can just shoot in the open like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Obviously, it was a very tragic shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| It's being investigated vigorously as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| There are leads, and hopefully those leads will result in an arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| As far as changing the mindset of some of our citizens, based upon this particular grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| it is designed to pay overtime for officers to work additional hours in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| in an attempt to prevent these types of crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| So that is one of the goals of applying for these types of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| Will there be any education in the schools or anything to kind of maybe separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| It's just a general program to help people realize the seriousness of actions you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| that threaten lives you're not even addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Well, first of all, we have school resource officers already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| that do provide some of that education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| We certainly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Last year we had 599 community meetings that we attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| in an effort to express the seriousness of committing crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| and to work with neighborhoods in trying to deal with their particular problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| So, yeah, there is additional money out there to work on these types of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| We're working with various segments of our community with trying to encourage cooperation with police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| in solving these crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| We appreciate what you do, and I know you can't control every individual out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| but we appreciate that you have that outreach effort in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| And, Chief, I just wanted to say I appreciate what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| and you could actually say that you have your department has been very proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| in dealing systemically with what Councilman De La Volpe is referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| by building strong neighborhoods, having neighborhood watches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Would you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| That's part of the 599 meetings we have attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| and have assisted neighborhoods in creating both the neighborhood watches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| as well as sustaining those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I mean, my neighborhood, Mechanicsville, is very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Stunning example of a neighborhood watch program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Yes, Chief, I was at a community meeting on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| and someone mentioned about increased interaction between the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| and especially our younger people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| And I know the police are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| You have a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| But do we have any kind of ongoing programs where we have interaction with the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| and especially some of our younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| where they can actually just kind of know each other as people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| First of all, we have police officers who actually help coach football teams in the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| that involve our youth from all over our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| We have just recently had two separate programs, youth academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| one for middle school, one for high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| where children who are in those particular schools where we have school resource officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| were selected based upon their efforts during the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| to receive sort of a week-long vacation, if you would, but they worked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| But at the same time, they spent a lot of time together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| throughout our entire community, was represented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| We have our school resource officers in all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| We're involved over at the Boys and Girls Club by having police officers over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| dealing with the kids after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| We're all over the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| And we have the Explorer Program where we really encourage our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| 14 to 18 years old, to become involved in an Explorer Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| where we teach basic social skills and assist them in providing role models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| hopefully to grow up and be strong, healthy, contributing citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| We have a cadet program, which is for ages 18 to 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| which is actually a position with the city of Knoxville where you're paid a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| You receive up to $3,000 a year in college reimbursement expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| You draw retirement time, vacation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| We allow the kids to go to school, to college, to work on an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| All the time they're working for us in a variety of roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| It's not carrying a pistol, but it's a variety of roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| So we're working with kids all the way from young people in the football programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| to after-school programs, to the 14 to 18-year-olds in Explorer Programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| to the 18 to 21 in the cadet programs, to our school resource officers across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| to our youth academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We try to cover all the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Well, thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| And I want to take this opportunity right now of concerning this particular crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| that Councilman Della Vope is referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| and encourage people who may be watching that have information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| to come forward with that information and assist our law enforcement people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| so that we can stop having these kinds of senseless crimes in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2097)|

| 0:36:03| for the CAT Fountain City Super Stop project in an amount not to exceed $62,241.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2163)|
| 0:36:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Mr. De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| I wonder if Mr. King can tell us a little bit about the Super Stop program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| I guess I've heard about maybe two of them in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| but, you know, we're spending a good deal of money to build this new transfer station downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| but obviously that doesn't solve all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| And if you could tell us a little bit about what we're trying to accomplish with CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| and Fountain City Super Stop, I think that would be really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I see Ms. McGinnis is going to pinch hit for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Engineering assisted with the detailed design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| but she could be much better to explain the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| I'm Cindy McGinnis, general manager of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| And the concept of Super Stops are for people who travel in outlying areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| that are going neighborhood to neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| and might not necessarily want or need to come downtown to transfer buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| So that was the idea behind the creation of the Super Stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| And this is one of several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| We have one currently in the Kirkwood-Magnolia Avenue serving east area of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| This Fountain City Super Stop will serve the north area of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| And we are in the process of developing one in the west on Walbrook near Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| Will you have a south one as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| We don't have as much service south currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| so we're hoping that will develop a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| We don't have a south currently planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| But the goal then is to have these sort of interneighborhood transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| that don't have you go all the way across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Any other questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2266)|

| 0:38:58| All right, motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Mr. De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I wonder if Sam could maybe tell us just one of the items that struck me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| in this information sheet was that we only had one bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Is there any explanation for why people weren't chasing after this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Actually, it's the current company that has been running the service for the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| and it's an extension of the contract, so there was no bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| Okay, so the bidder information is a little bit dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Yeah, that's really from the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| It's from the old bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| It's a two-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| So we're just extending the existing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| We didn't go out for bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| We didn't go out for bid, but we felt like the requirements of the contract had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| To give you an example, we're adding a transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| We're remodeling the Crutcher station over on Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| and we felt like we required the company to do a lot more than we had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| and to align it with, to be fair to the company that had bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| and wanted to bid and given us good service, we took advantage of our option to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| And we have some of these contracts where we buy, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| an option to renew for one or more years if it's to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| If not, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| 11L, a resolution authorizing the mayor to file a grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| with the United States Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| and the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| to provide funding in the amount of $4,828,886| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| to Knoxville Area Transit for formula urbanized area transit grant assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| for fiscal year 2010 with a city match of $536,543| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| and authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to accept said grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| And Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| I'll just ask, Sam, since there's a good deal of money involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| this basically $5 million effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| This looks like something we do every year, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| is apply for federal money and state money to help us run mass transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| because it doesn't really pay for itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| and we have to subsidize the system in order to get the service we need for our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| I'm just curious, is this a typical grant application where we do this every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| in this amount or this scope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Not to be incorrect, but, Cindy, you could correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| I think this is our formula money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| It's based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| So we get it every year unless the Congress drives the budget up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| And there's a city share in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Is that just sort of matching formula or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| What is that portion in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Ms. McGinnis would be best to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Good evening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Cindy McGinnis with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| It's an 80-10-10 split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| The federal government through the Federal Transit Administration provides 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| The city of Knoxville provides a 10% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| And the state of Tennessee provides a 10% match on some of the items listed there, not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| And we get additional money from the state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| We have a 5% or a 10% share in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Yes, Ms. McGinnis, on the replacement panels, you're anticipating several replacements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2549)|
| 0:42:38| For those of the type of shelters that are out in front of this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| or smaller ones throughout the city, do you anticipate several to be replaced or need to be replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| The shelters that will be purchased under Transit Enhancements, the first project listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| will be new bus shelters to be placed in new areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| We will also refurbish some existing shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| And the Fountain City bus stop improvements that you just approved will also be funded from this line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| And we have to spend at least 1% of our federal funding on Transit Enhancements every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| So we have an ongoing shelter improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2608)|

| 0:45:00| Mr. De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Mr. Stewart, I think I understand what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| but for the purposes of educating our citizenry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| we have two occasions during the year where we try to look at our budget and our allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| and catch that up with the actual real-time data that's coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| and this is the second of those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| This is one of two of what we consider housekeeping-type ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| The purpose of this ordinance as we approach year end, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| We may have to tweak a few line items here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| and this gives us the authority to do that at year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Year end being June 30th of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Fiscal period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you, Mr. De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| If not, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| 12C, an ordinance to amend Chapter 5 of the City Code so as to authorize residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| to keep limited numbers of domesticated chickens on a non-commercial basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| We have people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| We'd like to hear them before we even get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| We have, I believe, Mr. Hellwinkle, Ms. Spell signed up in favor, Ms. Needham signed up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| and Mr. Smith, I'm assuming you're in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Rules do allow three speakers to a side, and those in favor get to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Each speaker has up to five minutes, and then the side in favor actually gets a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| So I'm going to go ahead and call Mr. Hellwinkle, Ms. Spell, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| You can speak in any order that you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| It is 747 by the clock over your head, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| My name is Chad Hellwinkle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| 1625 Jefferson Avenue in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I'm here representing the Knoxville Hen Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| We're a group that comprises about probably hundreds of Knoxville residents who believe backyard hens are a good idea for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| And not all our supporters want hens in their backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| but they all believe that the city should make it feasible for people who so choose to have hens to have them in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| Some of the backyard hen supporters are here with us tonight, as you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| By now, you've probably been informed on the issues of backyard hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| In Knoxville, there have been several articles and newspapers over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| You've likely heard from people in your district and received letters from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| and other organizations supporting the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| We worked hard over the past year to move this process to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| and we are very happy that you are taking the time to vote on the backyard hen issue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| To review what we've done over the last year, we've garnered letters of support from the city's Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2871)|
| 0:48:00| the East Knoxville's Park Ridge Neighborhood Organization, North Knoxville's Old North Knoxville Neighborhood Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| South Knoxville's Island Home Neighborhood Organization Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| We've collected over 180 signatures in favor of backyard hen keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| I have that petition here with me I can give to you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| But tonight, I'd really like to emphasize that by making it feasible to keep chickens in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| we're not being trendsetters or on the cutting edge or really diving into uncharted territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| In fact, there's been over 50 other cities in the United States, some smaller, some bigger than Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| that have already adopted hen-friendly policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| And enough time has passed to gauge how these policies have worked in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| After several years nationally, backyard hens have been an astounding success of good public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| that bring multiple benefits to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| They're truly a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| I've spoken with animal control supervisors in a few of these cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Ten years ago, they were faced with enforcing a policy without precedence in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| And understandably, they were a little resistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| But now, after several years of the ordinances being in place, they have come to be very supportive of backyard hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| For example, Patrick Comfort, one of the animal control supervisors I spoke to in Madison, Wisconsin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| which is a city about the same size as Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| told me that there have been almost zero calls in eight years to complain about chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| He said it's been a very positive experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| He has seen the hens do more than simply provide eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| He said people are looking over fences and talking about chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| asking neighbors if they want some eggs or if they'll watch them while they're out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| Indeed, one of the multiple benefits of backyard hens is as a tool to improve community ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| And where there are improved ties, people watch out for each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| and crime is reduced, and the community is a safer place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Here in Knoxville, as an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| we wanted to make sure that any backyard hen ordinance put in place here would follow the successful policies in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| That is why, from the beginning, we worked with the overseeing agency, the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| to craft the proposed ordinance by evaluating ordinances in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| The ordinance before you today is the result of several meetings with the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| and has, in their words, enforcement teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| It was approved unanimously by the board last February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| Throughout this process, the Animal Control Board sought professional testimony on the health aspects of backyard hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| The board met with Dr. John New, an expert on cross-animal human diseases from the University of Tennessee Vet School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| who concluded that backyard hens pose, quote, no additional threat to human health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| John could not be here tonight, but Ronnie Neese, the manager of the Environmental Health Division of Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| and chair of the Animal Control Board is here to answer any questions you have about the health aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| or the process of developing the ordinance in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| Stephanie Welsh, chair of the city's Food Policy Council, sends her regrets that she could not attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| but she did email each of you today expressing the council's support for a key policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| in creating a sustainable and healthy food system in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| And I'd like to take a moment to review quickly some of the additional great things that hens can deliver to Knoxville's residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| They yield a healthy source of eggs that are high in omega-3s and low in cholesterol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| They offer pet companionship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| They're an excellent tool for turning kitchen scraps into valuable fertilizer for the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| They can strengthen community ties through the sharing of eggs and hen keeping knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| One more minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| They create green jobs, such as coop construction and hen care classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| But in addition to these, do not underestimate the pride and sense of wonder of a child who first cares for a hen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| collects his first egg, and then eats that egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| In a time when most of us are really removed from the process of where food comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| this is a valuable lesson that will pay off over a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Although the child may be raising hens, the hens are truly raising a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| And that's the other point I'd like to end on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| I've been working with hen proponents for over a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| and they're good citizens, and a lot of them came out here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| They're active in their communities, and they want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Ms. Spell or Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Ms. Spell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| Please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| It's 7.53 by the clock behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| And let me just say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Applause is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| I'd ask anybody to just not heckle, boo, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Applause is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Ms. Spell, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| My name is Sonya Spell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I live at 2827 Cecil Avenue in the 4th District, and I appreciate you listening tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| Ladies and gentlemen, urban chickens already exist, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| They are an innovation to city life that people have turned to to survive tough economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| and toxic and inhumane ecologic times, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| So your vote yes on this will help to safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| and harmoniously integrate this into Knoxville city life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| We've collaborated with experts, and the proposal is very fair to the individual egg farmers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| the egg farmers' neighbors, and the egg layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| And I don't think, I really don't think anybody can argue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Also, as Chad pointed out, kids today grow up, especially in urban environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| thinking that food comes from a box from a store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| and they have not gotten the opportunity to see it come from the earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| or from an animal and connect with nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| And so if you vote yes for this, people will be able to simply feed their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| feed their families simple, whole food that they know what substances have been introduced to these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| and they have the opportunity to introduce their children to nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| and have appreciation and become guardians of obviously finite resources that we need to look forward to protecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3260)|
| 0:54:33| And again, I appreciate you listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| Mr. Smith, it is 7.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3283)|

| 0:54:45| My name is Stephen Smith, and I live at 5443 Yosemite Trail, which is in the Timbercrest neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| I'm a graduate of the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| I'm not practicing now, but have went to vet school here in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| and practiced veterinary medicine for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| and I'm also the current executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| And what I wanted to do is just hit on a few topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| First of all, from my personal reasoning for getting involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| my wife and I have made a commitment in our home to decrease our environmental footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| to try to make our home a model home for sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| So we've got solar panels on the roof for both electricity and hot water, geothermal heat pump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| made a significant commitment to working with TVA and KUB about, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| making our home a net zero energy home in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| meaning that we produce more energy than we actually use at our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| An extension of that is that we're doing urban edible landscaping at our house in a tasteful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| We're actually planting things like blueberries and strawberries, have a garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| all these types of things that allow us literally to walk out the front door and pick food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| take it in, and prepare it right on hand there, which does a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| Some have been mentioned. It basically is, from a health perspective, is much healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| But from an environmental perspective, it not only connects my wife and I with our land and our smart child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| but then it also reduces our overall environmental footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| It reduces our carbon footprint in the sense that we're growing more food locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| so that we don't have to have it shipped in for thousands and thousands of miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| You know, we're all witnessing this tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| We all need to think about ways that we can reduce the way we consume fossil fuels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| So basically having food produced closer to home is one of those key ways that we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| This is a very small step in that direction, but it actually is a very important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| And, again, it allows people to take control of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| It allows people to take control of their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| It allows them to interact with their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| I've already had a number of conversations with people in my neighborhood about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and neighbors are excited about the possibility of me actually providing them with fresh eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| And so this is a great opportunity in a number of different arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| But I think it's also something that allows Knoxville to continue to grow in the tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| We've had a lot of leadership from the mayor and from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Being a solar city and being a city that wants to be forward-leaning on protecting the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| we're the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| So, again, these are the small steps that we can do to continue to have our city be a forward-leaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| thoughtful city that allows people to take control of their lives, be healthy, and actually set a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| So I'm here to speak strongly in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| As a veterinarian by training, there's absolutely no health issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| I've owned chickens before, or hens, when I lived out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and so I have some personal experience with it when I lived in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| But I've moved in closer to the city now so that I can reduce my vehicle miles traveled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| because we have an office right downtown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| So I encourage you all to support this and support it strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| I think it's a good, important step for the city, and we'd like your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Beth Needham is the only person signed up in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| Ms. Needham, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| It is 7.58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Beth Needham, 122 Leonard Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| And I think I'm a little outnumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| Anyway, and I didn't think I'd ever be talking to city council about chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| A couple of things I want to ask if someone can answer them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| On this ordinance it says it's amending Chapter 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| And also in our ordinances there's a residential districts section called 2.1.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3527)|
| 0:58:56| that also has prohibitions of farm animals and poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| A big thing for me and my husband is the enforcement of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| and what could happen to our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Also, any health concerns or sanitary concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| We live in a historical overlay, and we have neighborhood guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| And I see in here that it talks about building the chicken house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| and what it's made out of, what color it is, the sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| all the things about building the structure to keep the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| And we have a very hard time applying our guidelines to the homes in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| I cannot imagine us telling someone to paint something a certain color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| or telling them it had to be a certain material, especially if it's in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| Sometimes we can enforce our guidelines through the historic zoning committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| but it's really hard to enforce these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| And our codes are written up, and we try to enforce them as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| I thought I would go through this ordinance and just pick out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| And first off, I am not against pets, and I love farm-raised chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| and we have a garden in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So that's not what this is about to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| It talks about the benefits for this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| and from what I understand it's having pets and it's personal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| which I'm assuming it's mostly eating the fresh eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| My aunt and uncle have raised chickens for 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| They have a farm, 200 acres, out on the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| So I called my aunt and we talked about chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| They went from having two or three dozen down to four chickens before my uncle died last Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3666)|
| 1:01:14| And it was work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| It was a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| There were odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| There were predators, especially raccoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| And they had concrete around the outdoor enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| They had the wire that went up eight to ten feet, and they had a chicken house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| And they would still get predators that would kill the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| So that's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| It also draws rodents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And in my neighborhood in particular, we have rats and mice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| And the health department came out and said, they're coming from your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| So they talked to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| They have cat food in their yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| They refused to take it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| So we have to get three rat boxes in our yard from our pest control company to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| and change it monthly just to keep as many of the rodents out of our yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3726)|
| 1:02:16| Also, like I said, the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| I don't know, but it sounds like the building code department would have to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| in these structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| There would also have to be building permits drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| And then, again, all the aesthetics that go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| I just don't know how it could be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| The main thing about this is I just think chickens are still considered farm animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| There's a reason that we had an ordinance that said we could not have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Our house, for instance, is 12 feet from the house next door on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| Some of our houses in the older neighborhoods are even closer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| So I appreciate the effort that people have put into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| but I think that there are some other concerns that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Are there any more speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Well, there's a rebuttal time yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Those who spoke in favor get a two-minute rebuttal if you choose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| And a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Is Ronnie Neese here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Okay, I guess he said he might be a better person to speak directly to the writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| up of the ordinance and the preciseness of the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| If you want him to come down, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| We also might have specific questions during our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| But I guess I could just say that they made the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| It's three pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| We modeled it after other cities, and they wanted something with teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| And so they didn't want something really vague that said it should look good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| because that's not really enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| The Animal Control Board said if they wanted to do it over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| they would go through and redo the dog and cat rules to make them a lot more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| So we got the special treatment on this that's three pages long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| and they really precisely laid down what a hen coop should look like so it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| in fact, is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| And it's modeled after other cities that have been in place for 10 years in some places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| and they've had great success with their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Are there questions for any of the speakers first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| I'll start with Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I wanted to ask Mr. Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| have you had dialogue with the various Neighborhood Association presidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| And if so, how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| David Massey, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| I can tell you that the Neighborhood Advisory Council looked into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| I think I sent you all the deliberations of that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| They were unable to render a decision one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| They split five to five on whether to support this ordinance or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| We have had mention of this in our neighborhood newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| which goes out weekly to all of the registered neighborhood organizations in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| and I can say that I have not had a single neighborhood organization call me asking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| other than what we did with the Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| I'll amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| There was one neighborhood organization from Fountain City that sent some concerns to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| to the Neighborhood Advisory Council, which were considered when they made their deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| I've just been trying to gauge constituents' opinion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| and I've reached out to a number of friends of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| and I've heard from an overwhelming number of people that support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| and not from very few people that opposed it so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| And we are discussing this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| And I just know we saw a show of hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| but I'd like to ask those that support this if they would stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| And then if you could sit down, I'd like to ask the ones that oppose it if they could stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| That's not always a good gauge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| Another 190,000 people out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Well, believe me, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| I mean, you get six people in here sometimes have a lot of influence over the entire rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| But I do like to know, you know, who bothered to come up here and who didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| And as I said, we're talking about this on first ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| and we are going to decide after, I guess, tonight, first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| whether we want to have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| which would help us kind of look at what kind of questions we're going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| And I guess I wanted to ask Mr. Hellwinkle a couple of questions about the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| the amendments here and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| In terms of the adverse effects, impacts, what about noise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4043)|
| 1:07:32| Noise, the roosters are going to be banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| The noisy ones are not going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Hens make a squawking noise when they lay an egg, but they're also fast asleep come sundown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| It's a biological thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| They go inside and they actually fall asleep when the sun goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| What about the question of odor in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| It's come up a lot, and if you've ever visited a coop with only six hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| there's really not an odor associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| The birds themselves don't smell, and the manure is composted in the straw fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| Most people that have a prejudice against chickens because they smell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| because they go to a farm where there's 30, 50, 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| or they pass an industrial facility where there's thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| and that's where the connotation that actually hens smell comes from, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| But the limited amount of birds we're talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| six in a city lot, the smell is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| You don't worry about the attraction of rodents and predators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| I don't because, as the speaker spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| was saying there's cats next door, unattended food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| If you leave food unattended, you will collect rodents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Chickens are going to be locked up in the coop at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| They're going to be predator safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| But it's important to put enough food out for those hens to eat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| and then close it up in a lock-proof container in a shed or something after sundown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| And animal control basically, Chief or Steve, they basically, it's complaint-driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| and the complaints would go to animal control, except for the coops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Except for the coops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Let me, before we go to the next person, we don't have a motion on the floor yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| and I'd sort of like to get that to move things parliamentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| I'd like to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Well, I want to take you down this path that I've been down with this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| I agree with one of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| I never thought we'd be addressing hens from a council perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| But it all started back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| I think it was the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| It was a freezing cold Sunday, and I remember there was a meeting at the public library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| and a lot of enthusiastic folks were there and wanted to explain to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| and Councilman Grieve and Councilman Woodhull was there, and, man, I've got to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4198)|
| 1:10:06| I've got to hear about urban hens, chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| So I went, and I thought, after I left that meeting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| these folks are serious about what they're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| At first, I just kind of snickered at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| I mean, I'll be honest with you, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| But then, you know, I started studying the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| My nephew helped me gather a lot of information from other cities and about the whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| And then I thought, well, you know, this is a serious issue, and I need to address it as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| And I really wasn't, you know, a lot of time passed, and it was about, I don't know, five or six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| whenever it was, and I went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| I was invited to the Park Ridge community for their opening of their community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| So, you know, I went over by there, and it was a lot of the same people that were there at the community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4250)|
| 1:11:00| And I really, it struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| You know, I saw white people together with black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| I saw young people with old people, and I saw just people were just delighted in what it was they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4267)|
| 1:11:15| And what, in my mind, they're doing is they're really, and I don't know if urbanist is even a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| but to me it's somebody that just lives in, you know, it's really inner city folks that care about their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4281)|
| 1:11:30| They're making their community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| They're teaching their children, their young people along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| And I decided then that this, you know, even though it's a different subject, it's the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| It's the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| And I thought then when I drove off from there that Sunday, I said, you know, I'm going to support this measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| because it's a very good thing, and I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| And then I want to tell on myself a little bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I grew up, as, you know, some of you may know, in the middle of Fountain City on Gibbs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| And my brother was a really, is a really cool guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| And he loves animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| And he was a guy that some of you probably aren't old enough to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| but in the back of the comic books you had the little incubators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| And you could, you know, you could get the eggs and, you know, it's like, dude, those will never work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| They're not going to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| We had like eight chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| I mean, they were running around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| He was the one that went to Emory's Five and Dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| He got the little blue Easter duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| And we had Quacky for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| So help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Hubert may remember coming over to my house as we grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| But, I mean, we had those chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| And it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| We had so many eggs that we were giving them to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| And it was cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| They didn't expect it, but we wanted to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| So it did bring us, you know, it did bring people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| And I'll never forget, my mom said, that's enough, they got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| And there was 50 of us out there before summer football practice started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| She said, you catch those chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| And, man, if you'd have seen all of us running after those chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| And it was hilarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| But we got them and took them to the appropriate farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| But more than anything else, you know, I have heard from a vast amount, a lot of people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| And I'm not talking about two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| We all know that we get people, oh, all these people are wanting me to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| And it's like three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| But I have heard from a lot of my people in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| And they elected me to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| And I feel like the vast majority of the people of the first district do want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Mr. De La Boca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Well, I think all of us have heard from a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| because folks who like the hens are certainly passionate about their belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| And they've expressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| There are some questions, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| And I look at this ordinance, and I wasn't there when it was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| And I keep wondering, why do we have up to 12 hens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| If you're going to have a few hens in your backyard for your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| 12 hens sounds like you're going, to me, into business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| I mean, you're going to have at least one, maybe two eggs a day from a hen, certainly one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| That's a lot of eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Now, maybe you're going to share them with friends or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| But I'm concerned that in some of these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| we have lots that are 50 feet wide by 100 or 120 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| And, you know, we have a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| It's not 25 feet like some cities have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| It's 10 feet from the abutting property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| If you've got a 50-foot wide backyard and you've got 12 chickens or hens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| or call them what you will, you start to have some impact on your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| Now, if you're lucky, they enjoy your hobby and everyone goes along happily together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| But I know we're going to have issues going downstream if we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| And I'm concerned about why we have the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| I don't know why the numbers aren't four or five or six or that order of magnitude as opposed to a dozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| So I'll raise that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| And I'm concerned about the composting of the manure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| I can't imagine that if you have a dozen chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| and you're composting the manure and the straw with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| you've got to let it sit there and ripen for a month before you can spread it around the tomato plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| Is it going to have a little smell and have a little insect issues and, you know, maybe some concerns there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| I think I'd like to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Maybe that's the function of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Maybe that's the function of talking to our health department or someone else about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| From what I've heard, the disease issue doesn't seem to be as strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| although I've heard from at least one lady in Fountain City who is concerned about histoplasmosis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| and other airborne illnesses you can get if you have dried scat in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| And, you know, I can't ignore those people who comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| that I certainly don't want my health jeopardized by my neighbor's activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| We've heard some people that talk about property values and can I sell my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| or will I have a diminished price if someone comes to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| and there's, you know, chicken coops and chicken housing next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| And I don't know if that affects the marketplace or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| I've not done a market study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| I've not had an appraiser to come out and say that there's a dollar price effect on one's home if you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| But those are certainly concerns we need to be thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| So, one, I think, is the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| I don't know whether 10 feet is too close to the boundary or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| I mean, I don't know how we arrived at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Maybe there's a better way to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| I hope we have someone in the city or in the organization that can guide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| And I certainly think the numbers of 6 to 12 get excessive the smaller the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| I mean, if you want to be a farmer, you need to be out in the country and out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| And I don't mean that we can't have hens in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| but I do think that if it's a family activity and a family hobby and a family food source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| that the numbers ought to be more restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| And certainly on a trial basis, they ought to be more restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| I have spoken to people like Karen Pappas of the animal control system of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| And I don't know if she's here, but the chief's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| And they've got eight officers, and they cover 100 square miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| and they deal with dogs and cats and strays and rabid animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| And they're pretty busy, and they don't have a lot of spare resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| So I'm concerned about how we enforce this as a practical matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| I assume that some of you, and I know some of you have chickens already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| I don't know if it's the folks in the audience, but I've gotten lots of phone calls and e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| And we already have chickens in the city, but we don't have a chicken ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| So we're going to have enforcement issues, whether it's because people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| and maybe it isn't the folks who are the, you know, the hens in the city kind of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| who really are rigorous and religious about their approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| But we're going to have situations where someone gets these animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| and decides that they really, the kids lose interest or they lose interest and they get neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| And the New Sentinel has articles this past week about people who get hoarding crazy about animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| and do things that aren't wholesome or healthy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| And so we will have enforcement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| So I guess we need to be asking the chief or Ms. Pappas or someone, are we geared up to deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| Do they have any recommendations outside the face of the ordinance that if we're going to go down this path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| that have better precautions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| Because the folks who want them are very enthusiastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| And, you know, I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| I'm a gardener myself, and I have a pretty good backyard garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| but I must say my vegetables don't leap over the fence or fly into trees or have those kind of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| So, I mean, it kind of stays in the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| And chickens have the ability to maybe spread your problem to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| So I am concerned about that, and I want us to be looking at that very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| And, Chief, I don't know if you have anything that you can tell us about animal control or staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| but that's an important thing because we'll set this ball in play, and then we have to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| So if you have something, I would like to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| Well, Supervisor Karen Pappas is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| and she's prepared to make a short presentation along with representatives of Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| and the health department should those questions arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| But as far as having adequate staffing, we certainly have adequate staffing to handle our workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| If this council decides that this is an ordinance that should be passed, we will enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| But Karen is here if you have specific questions for her along with, as I said, other representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| Karen, if you've got a minute, and I don't know if this is the appropriate time or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| Maybe it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Let me hold that in a second and get through Mr. Woodall and Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And I didn't know what the protocol was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| I'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| I think we should hear from those people eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Mr. Woodhall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| As the sponsor of this ordinance, I wanted to just put forward some of my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| I definitely agree with Councilman Della Volpe that there are going to be some hiccups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| and things that we have to attend to any time you do anything new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| There's going to be some adjustments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| I also really appreciate Councilman Pavlis's words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| I was at that meeting in January, and if you'll recall, it was very well attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| and everybody had lots of different opinions about how to proceed, and we encouraged them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| They asked us lots of questions about what is the process, and we gave them feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| And they were not united.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| They had lots of different opinions, and they have come together and done their homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| and I appreciate Chad Helwinkel's leadership in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| I think that they did a lot of good work and research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| and we encourage them to build relationships with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| and also with those people who can give them insight, not just tell them what they want to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| but also make their position stronger by telling them what the concerns are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| So I feel like it was a great process, and as the sponsor, I'm very much in favor of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| I think you can see, you can look at it in two broad views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| One is, in isolation, it does seem maybe a little nutty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| It's like, did the Klampots just move to town, and they required this amenity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| I think another way of looking at it is you really have to go back to the mayor who just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| One of his priorities was and still is stronger, safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| And through a variety of initiatives, we have an office on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| We have more community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| We have more neighborhood watches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| We have an energy and sustainability task force that's promoting more sustainable living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| We are building the city from the inside out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| I actually feel like urban hen raising is one aspect of that life that we in the city have promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4926)|
| 1:22:20| I really loved what Chad said about how it does build stronger relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| And we need stronger relationships in our neighborhoods to have safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| People watching each other and becoming more involved with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| that has been a great benefit in our work to build from the inside out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| and to connect the downtown with the local neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| and to support people in community gardens and a whole variety of civic building opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4966)|
| 1:22:55| So, in my mind, it is going to be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| But I actually think that the kind of relationships that are out there among the people in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| that I don't think the real question is can we police this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4985)|
| 1:23:14| But because my experience with a lot of the people who are behind this is that they have a very high regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| for each other and they have a lot of strong relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| So it's going to be complicated and there are going to be some hiccups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| but it's a great thing for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| I'm going to go with Councilwoman Palmer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| First of all, I'd like to say that the Hen Coalition, I applaud your sincerity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| and your interest in the environment, healthy food sources and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| However, I did receive some phone calls today from people who did not have a spirit of neighborhood unity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| with their neighbors on either side, one side or the other, who did have hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| One gentleman really liked his neighbors and he was happy to have them until they got the two hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| And they did take care of the hens most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| although one of the hens showed up on the back deck of a neighboring house early one morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| But mostly he said that the noise from the hens did not just occur at an egg-laying moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| It occurred throughout the day, and he was pretty stressed about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| He sold his house, and I said, Well, did you have any trouble selling your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Because I know a concern has been property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| And he said, No, because the brother of the neighbor who has the hens bought my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| because they wanted to live next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| So he obviously didn't encounter a property value issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Some other people I spoke with did have property value issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| both as prospective purchasers of a house that would be next door to someone who was raising hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| and they just didn't want to spend the money to take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| So I do think that property values is something that needs to be factored into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| One of the things about promoting neighborhood unity is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| And along with the mayor, I, too, believe that we need strong and safe neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| But I think that everyone in this room has had a neighbor whose dog or cat did not obey the code that is written in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5122)|
| 1:25:32| And I think that with chickens, this will become one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| And just as in my neighborhood, we have people who have dogs that need to be walked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| and we have a rule in the neighborhood that you clean up after your dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| That doesn't happen always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| We also have neighbors in my neighborhood whose cats roam at will, although there's an ordinance about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| So I'm not doubting the sincerity of the Hen Coalition and the people who are interested in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| What I am concerned about is people who think this is a cool idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| and I'll run down and I'll get two or three chickens, and I'll get my coop built, and life will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| But when the kids get bored or go off to school or whatever, I think that that raises some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| One thing that hasn't been mentioned is that we do have an ordinance in the city that does prohibit the raising of chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5180)|
| 1:26:27| And yet we have a group of people before us tonight who have chosen to ignore that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| and now they're coming forth asking that the ordinance be changed so that what they are doing is within the parameters of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| We have two attorneys here in the room, and I think there's an issue called clean hands when you're in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| And if my understanding of clean hands is correct, if you come forth and you have violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| or your hands are dirty because you've not obeyed an ordinance or a law, you really don't have good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| And I'm not saying the hen coalition doesn't have standing to bring this issue and has not followed the process for an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| But I am concerned that a motivating factor for this ordinance is that we have a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| who are raising hens throughout the city and either knowingly or perhaps unknowingly violated that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| and chose to ignore it, which then brings us to the point of people who, if this ordinance is passed, raise hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| may decide that they don't have to have the right coop or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| So these are just some concerns that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| I have heard from people who are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| I think the story in the paper this morning must have triggered some responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| because my phone picked up quite a bit today and so did my e-mail in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| But I probably will have more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Oh, I do have one more thing, and that is predators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| Last fall, we noticed a number of coyotes on Middlebrook Pike in the area of Dowell Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| So as I did some research on this issue, I found that there are several predators that really do like chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5281)|
| 1:28:08| and particularly eggs and can find ways to get into the coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| We all are familiar with Wiley coyote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| We have a number of coyotes, and that is an increasing problem according to TWRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| We have some foxes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Skunks love chicken eggs, and we have possums in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| as well as overhead predators who can swoop down into an open coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| So I'm concerned about an increase in an unwanted animal population in the interest of the eggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| that would nurture and sustain families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Thank you, Mr. Haslam, and welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| I'm glad to see you, like everybody else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| A couple things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| I generally am supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| I thought a lot about some of the enforcement concerns and the concerns with predators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| and chickens on the loose, and finally somebody told me that chickens on the loose are not really that big of a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| They're not very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| They don't have teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| A little less worrisome than some of the dogs we deal with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| I have a lot of concerns about getting it right, about doing it in a way that is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| We do have an option to come back later and modify it, but to get it right up front, there's some little things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| I think Mr. DellaVolpe talked a little bit about the 12 chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| I also was struck that the UH-12 actually had a fairly small lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| We might want to tinker a little bit with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I wanted to do two things, and I know Mr. Brown has his light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| but we had some questions earlier about hearing from Ms. Pappas and some of the animal shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5378)|
| 1:29:45| the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| I also want to get some little clarity about the actual zoning implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| because it feels like, from what I understand, is that we have to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| and then we have to do another step before chickens are legal and maybe take some steps on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| If I was still chairing the meeting, I would actually ask Mr. Brown if he wanted to speak before we heard from Ms. Pappas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| or whether you would have a hold on that, but I'm not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| Don't let me interrupt you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Councilman Brown, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| It's your meeting now, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Just barely, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| She can speak if she wants to first, but I'll make my few comments on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| I'm listening to what Councilwoman Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| I think, first of all, the Urban Hen Coalition, let me compliment them for their civic participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5434)|
| 1:30:43| but I'm sure that there are many people in this city who are really not aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| And once they become aware of it, we may have a much different opinion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| And I think if it is passed, it needs to be passed perhaps temporarily where it can be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5456)|
| 1:31:07| I don't have a major problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I think we used to have hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| I think we had some hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| We had a chicken coop in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| And I'm wondering, I don't know, when this city ordinance was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| I guess it was passed when we moved more from a rural type city to a more urban city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5483)|
| 1:31:32| And I assume the city fathers at that time had a reason for passing this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| And I am concerned about health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| And I don't know, I think it may be good to have some workshop or a little bit more information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5501)|
| 1:31:50| Those are all the comments that I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| I have not heard a lot from a lot of people on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| Mainly I've heard from the Urban Hen Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| I've had a few e-mails and a few letters from a few other people who are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| But those are the only comments I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| I, too, am curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I'm curious, are we going to have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| Because if we are, I'm going to save my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| And I'm also going to, I think we ought to probably wait and hear from some of the more qualified speakers on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| So maybe we could talk about that a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| Vice Mayor Becker, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| That's a very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| When we talked about this at dinner two weeks ago, we decided to wait until tonight to decide whether we're having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| If we choose to have one, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| I don't know, when we were scheduling the workshop on the development tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| the summer did not look like a great time for getting all nine people at a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| But we can give that a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| That's a decision councilmembers can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| My inclination would be to move ahead with the discussion here and see where we get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| And I don't know whether people feel, if folks feel like a workshop is what we need on this, you should speak up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5583)|
| 1:33:11| But my inclination would be to continue the discussion and see where we get tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| Other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| I guess the question on that, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| I guess I'd like to hear, I started before asking if we could hear from Ms. Pappas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| You know, and I just briefly because sometimes we go through these things three and four times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| and there's really no reason to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| And so if you think you're ready to vote, you know, then maybe we go ahead and hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| Well, I think I'm ready to be educated a little bit more because I think we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| We've heard, I mean, the advocates are very strong, and they're very ardent about their desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| and I think sincere about their desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| But there are still open questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Let me ask just a short one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| I was going to suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Mr. Bailey sounds like he would like a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| How many folks would prefer a workshop to having a discussion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| Let me see a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Can you have both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| We might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| I mean, I think Mr. Bailey's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Sometimes we do talk about things for a while and then schedule a longer discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| You know, the same goes for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| They have to come out, and they have to come out, and then people stay tuned and watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| I guess the point would be if you already know you want a workshop, maybe we ought to go ahead and move that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| So how many people already know I definitely would like to have a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| I saw one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| We're going to go on with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| And I think we talked earlier before you came, Mr. Mayor, about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| and I don't know, Chief, you mentioned that Ms. Pappas had a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I'm sorry, did I cut you off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Chief, you talked about Ms. Pappas having a presentation, or was it just answering questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| Principally answering questions, but some general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| And I know there were folks from the Animal Control Board, Young-Williams, and Animal Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| And I guess, I don't know if there is a specific question, but I guess the Chief dealt with do we have enough staffing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| I'd ask the folks from Young-Williams if you all have any concern about overloading the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| I know we talked a little bit today, but if you could even share what you spoke with me about, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| So if you could come on down and take a minute on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| If both of you all could just come down and we'll let you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| Whichever would like to go first is fine, and you can just give us your name and title maybe in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| Aaron Pappas, Supervisor, Animal Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| I had a presentation, but I've been here 24 years and handled a lot of calls on chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5737)|
| 1:35:46| This has become a real problem for Animal Control Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| I looked at some figures, and in 2007, 54 calls, 2008, 42, 2009, 66, and we've got 26 this year already on problems on chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5750)|
| 1:36:01| Neighbors calling in, people calling about loose chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Talked to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| One of the concerns is, my concern, is the predators because we do have more and more calls on coyotes, foxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| dens of foxes, skunks, raccoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| This city is really overpopulated with raccoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| Rodent problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| I think there would be a problem with rodents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Also, we're going to start getting the calls on the people that are next door that have the dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| and they're going to be barking at the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| They're going to be trying to get through the fence at the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| That's only natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| And if any of you already know, we have a lot of calls on the barking dogs, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| Animal Control does not agree with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| I think it will be just cause more problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| and I think that eventually you're going to have people who the newness wears off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5813)|
| 1:37:01| Like I said, the kids lose interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| and then the chickens are going to be out on somebody else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| They can fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| They can fly over the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| They'll be running loose in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| and they'll be expecting Animal Control to resolve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| Tim, give us your title, name and title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Tim Adams, executive director at Young Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| I talked to a couple of folks about this prior to this meeting, a couple of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| And my biggest concern all along has been whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| or not we would see an influx of additional animals into the animal center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| That's always my concern is the crowding or overcrowding issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| While I admit I did speak with about six other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| that have passed this in the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| all of those basically said that they had not seen such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| They had not seen an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| But we take in, between the city and the county, about 100 chickens a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| So some increase we could deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| If the increase got too much, it would become a problem as it does with other animals when the numbers go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| Especially this time of year would be a challenge for us, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| Let's see, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| I applaud the Urban Hen Coalition in their dedication to working with all of the stakeholders in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| from animal control to the Neighborhood Advisory Council, the Young Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| the Veterinary College, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| I think we've heard a little bit about the chickens flying, and I can't find the language right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| but I think it says in here that the wings have to be clipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| Is that right, Ms. Poplin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Doesn't the ordinance specify that the wings are clipped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| I'd like to check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| I thought I read that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| That's under enclosures on page four, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| So if that's yes, enclosures, number one, all hens must be wing clipped to prevent escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| So I think, you know, the issue of them flying over fences probably is covered under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| I think the greater issue that I'm hearing from folks comes back to the responsibility of the pet owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| And, you know, we all know there are people who are responsible about their dogs and cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| and there are people that are irresponsible, and it's pretty difficult to legislate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| I think the passion of the folks that are interested in this ordinance has been very evident this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| and to everyone that sits on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| One department in the city that I heard from that I think has some concerns that they would like to iron out further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| and it's not an opposition necessarily, but our codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| I spoke with Ms. Cash prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| and I might suggest in council's consideration of this tonight that we, if this, in fact, passes on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| that we consider delaying second reading until four weeks from tonight rather than two weeks tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| and convene those stakeholders again, the folks from the Urban Hen Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| Councilman Woodhall, who's sponsored this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| get the codes enforcement department in and make sure that the language feels comfortable to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| because it sounds like there's some enforceability clauses in here both that animal control would look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| and that also building inspections and codes would look at in terms of the coop enclosures and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| I know the folks in support of this have attempted really to write something that's watertight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| I was looking at the enclosure section again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| and it indicates that the enclosure has to be enclosed so that the predators can't get in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| Now, I know we heard someone say that, you know, a wily raccoon sometimes still finds a way to get in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| but that's, I guess, just it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| I mean, that's a fact of life, but I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| the ordinance that's in front of us has tried to anticipate every possible problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| Councilmember Brown suggested revisiting the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| and we've done that many times in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| We've said, you know, this is worthy of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| Let's come back in a year and review and hear from our stakeholders and see where we've gone with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| So I guess I'll refrain from further comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| but I'd like to see a bit of a delay between first and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| if this does pass on first reading, to allow some more time for the city departments to reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| I'll go to Mr. Whitehall next, but first Mr. Swanson has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Let me just clarify what the language says about the enclosures and the wing clipping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| because sometimes word gets out when it gets said, and you really need to have what it actually says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| And what it says with regard to that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| hens must be kept in a fenced enclosure at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| The fenced enclosure must be either one covered or at least 42 inches high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| in which case all hens must be wing clipped to prevent escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| So the wing clipping only occurs if it's not covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| It doesn't apply if you don't have to clip their wings if it's enclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6122)|
| 1:42:11| but you do if you're instead relying upon the 42 inches high provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| You're anticipating the PETA uproar for clipping wings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| I wasn't anticipating anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| We'll make sure when we're talking about what the ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| everybody really understands what it actually says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| I actually like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| I like the idea of if this passes on first reading, getting the stakeholders together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| Chad, do you like that idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| I wanted to ask the officer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| I know you work for the animal control unit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Are you also on the board that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| No, but she's also on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| And that was a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| And so I imagine you voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Voted for this set of guidelines if it were to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| We wanted to have some sort of guidelines in place if this ordinance did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| At the time there were no guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| I just was a little confused because you did vote for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| Just for the ordinance, but in the event that this ordinance passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| that you could have the chickens, urban hens, that council voted that they agreed for it to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| If someone does neglect their hens and they get a call or some hens get picked up, then what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| You take them down to the animal center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| And then what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Do you get them back healthy and have them up for adoption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| To this point, with the hens that we've gotten in or the roosters, either one, because we get both at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6230)|
| 1:43:58| we have some farmers who will take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| We haven't gotten in such a volume that we couldn't place them in the county with someone who is interested in having them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6240)|
| 1:44:07| But if we pass this, then people in the city can come down there and adopt them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| If we could figure out how to put them on the adoption floor, we don't necessarily have designed space on the adoption floor for chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| We would have to adapt something, but it could be done, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| I got more laughter out of that than the quacky story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| He still has a rubber duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| I got pictures of quacky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| I can prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| Don't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| Mayor, there's eight of us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| We may have a 4-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Are you feeling cooped up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| I won't be pinned down right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| I want to just state, you know, I want to explain myself on my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| First of all, there's been a couple of people that I really respect that are opposed to this, and I want to find out why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| And it leads me, as I think about that, I hadn't had a chance to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| I think I know that all neighborhoods and areas are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| And maybe, you know, we've talked in the past about certain ordinances where we could let people opt in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| I think one thing comes to mind is that parking in the front yard ordinance, you know, we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| So I throw that out there as something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| And I don't know in that that was an enforcement that would further complicate the enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| so I don't want to do anything to complicate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| But I am going to support this on first reading, and I plan to reach out to more neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6339)|
| 1:45:50| And as I even think about my own home and the hen issue, I would like to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| I think it would be, you know, you know where your food source is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| They're pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| You know, it sounds like a fun thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| And I think I always sort of revert back to personal responsibility and the good in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| And if I wanted to do that, I would probably go ask my surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| and I wouldn't want to do anything that they didn't want me to do, and I don't know how far that goes in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| But I think people generally respect their neighbors and their surroundings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| and the quality of living and personal property values and all those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| But as Councilman Brown said, if we do pass this in first and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| we could always revisit it and come back and overturn this and change it and reverse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| So I'm going to vote to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| I don't want to ask a question of Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| I want to make sure I understand the zoning implications on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| What we will do if we pass this on first and second readings, we will say that chickens are not prohibited here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| but we will set up something while they will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| They will not be allowed in any particular zone in the city, which means you can have them, but you actually can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| So we will need to then have MPC change some of the zoning regulations to allow chickens, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| That's really correct, because right now there's not a residentially zoned area where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| through zoning, these would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| This ordinance just addresses public health, safety, and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| so we have land use regulations that have to complement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Another step at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| I want to suggest two amendments that I think, Mr. Swanson, will be minor amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| and we can add them in the discussion period afterwards, and I like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| One is to put in something in the whereas clause that actually asks MPC to make the changes to the zoning code to let this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| I think it's really helpful for us to be clear on what we're asking MPC to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| and I think that would be a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| The second is right now we start with the permit you get for chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| and say the first one will last from whenever you get it until the end of December 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| and I just know the process that MPC will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| Nobody is going to be getting a permit until November of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| and I'd like to suggest that we just change that and say your first permit lasts until December of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| Now, a third one that I'd like to consider, it sort of goes with Mr. Delevaux's concern about the no, it's actually not his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6495)|
| 1:48:24| It's my concern about how quickly we get to the 12 chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| There's provisions right now, and, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| if this is not a minor one and would cause us to then have to do a third reading if we postponed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| and considered it after we passed on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| right now you're allowed to have six chickens on any lot containing 5,000 square feet or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| and then for every 1,000 square feet you get one additional chicken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| and that feels like we're escalating a little too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| I'd actually like to change that to you get one additional chicken for maybe every 2,000 or 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| It just feels like in my neighborhood where the lots are, my lot, which is fairly small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| you'd be allowed to have eight chickens, and it feels a little like we're growing a little fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| Now, would that be a substantial amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| The issue is not major and minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| The issue is, is it substantive or is it not substantive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Clearly it is substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| It is substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Then I think I want to make that amendment now so that we don't have to then deal with a third reading on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| Does that make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| So I'm actually going to offer, and I guess before I offer it, I'm going to ask what the sponsor thinks of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| which is to not have us allow as much density in smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| Mr. Woodhull, what's your thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| I don't know if Mr. Helwinkel wants to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| My thinking is I would like to ask Mr. Helwinkel where –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| I'm not being chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| Where did we get these numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| That sounds fair to slow the increase of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| The number of 12 came from the City of Seattle's code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| We kind of copied it from them due to concerns of some people in South Knoxville who actually –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| it was neighbors that had adjoining lots, there was four neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| and they wanted to share one coop for four families, and they each had – it was on like an acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| So they said could it somehow gradually increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| When you get up to about an acre lot, you can have 12 birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| But it does, you know, go quickly up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| So if you wanted to lower that, I think that would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| If you're fine with it, I will make an amendment that we change the – in Section D1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| where it says for each 1,000 square feet of lot area in excess of 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| one additional chicken may be allowed up to a maximum of 12, to change that 1,000 to 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| And that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| The motion is to change the 1,000 to 2,000 in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| Second, but clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| So then does that reduce the maximum number of 12 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| It just means that you have to have a bigger lot before you get to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| I still want to renew my concern that 12 seems like we've gone beyond the kind of the backyard family project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| to almost like being in the chicken business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| And we are talking about an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| I don't see why we should start with that kind of high ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| It may be that over time we say, hey, that's a great thing and we can have more chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| But I'd rather see us start more gradual because we run the risk of the complaints coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| if this gets kind of going like gangbusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| So I'd rather see us with a lower number max, whether that's six or some other number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| I'm not wise enough to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| My other question relates to this, and I know we're talking about a permit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| but do we grandfather the chickens in once they're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| Is it a permit, renewable each year, and the terms can change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| Because Mr. Brown's question raises that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| We'll be revisiting this if we were to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I don't know whether we are or not, but if we were to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| But what happens for whatever has been approved in the past is still a concern I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| and I don't know how that works legally, Mr. Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| You're talking about if you came back and repealed this after granting some permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Yeah, or changed numbers or requirements or setbacks or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| Does someone have a right to stay where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| Once you've issued a permit, that's an interesting legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| I have not done any research on that particular question with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| Typically with regard to health and welfare issues, the city has control over health and welfare issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6765)|
| 1:52:52| And so you can make changes that are governed to health and welfare issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| And I don't think there would be huge financial repercussions associated with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| and that's often what results in a stoppable situation where you can't change later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| I guess you could have a tail at the end of this that says that no vested rights are obtained by getting the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| beyond the permit period or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| You're making my head hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Counselor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| I just want to say I agree with Counselor Mandela-Vopay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| and I think it's good for the effort to initially limit the numbers because you need to introduce this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6803)|
| 1:53:31| And I think over time people will appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| but I don't think you want people to be overwhelmed or think they're going to be overwhelmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| or to create some sort of groundswell movement against it by the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| So I would like to entertain some reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| And I was wondering, Chad, if you agree with that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| I don't know, you know, the number 12 seems like a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| And if you had a much smaller number based on the square footage of the homes, the yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6835)|
| 1:54:02| then, you know, it just seems to be more acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| Twelve is reaching the upper limit of what other cities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| I don't want to give the approval for the whole coalition of lowering that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| I just want to give you the fact that the 12 is kind of the upper bound of some cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| and six is probably, you know, a good lower to middle bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Counselor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| Mr. Chad, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| About the other cities that you've talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| and we've heard here tonight about predators being a problem or potential problem here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6878)|
| 1:54:45| I assume that that's not a problem in the cities that you mentioned, Madison, Wisconsin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| and other cities that has not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| Yeah, I've talked to the animal control supervisors in Madison, Fort Collins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| Portland, and Seattle, and they didn't mention the rodent problem being significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6899)|
| 1:55:09| Well, we mentioned some other predators that may be more existent in some geographical areas than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| particularly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| So that's one of the concerns that I have, but probably eventually I'll just support it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6918)|
| 1:55:28| I think if you keep the food locked up, you know, what attracts predators is not really the chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| Remember, the chickens are going to be locked up at night when usually a lot of those predators come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| And if the food is locked up at night, just like dog food or cat food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| you're going to eliminate a lot of those predator problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| I'd like to offer a substitute motion to reduce it from 12 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| Vice Mayor, there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Is that changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Oh, that would just change it to 6, regardless of the size of your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| There's a substitute motion to change it to 12 to 6 on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Any other comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Ready to vote on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| I heard eight ayes and no nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| Mr. Swanson, do we need a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| to allow this to come back in four weeks rather than two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| How do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| If we would like to consider this on second reading in four weeks rather than two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| Or does it have to come back and then be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Does it have to come back in two weeks and we postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| There really is no provision for moving it to four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| because our charter says that you meet every two weeks and you consider the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| So, really, the better thing to do is it will come back in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| and you'll postpone it two more weeks if you're going to do it within the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Well, I'll say publicly my intent will be if this passes tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| when it comes back in two weeks, my intent will be to postpone it that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| to allow time for further stakeholder discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| I'm going to go to Mr. DelVolpe and then I'll come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| I'm going to renew the statement I made, I guess, before you arrived, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| but that was we were talking about whether this was going to be acted on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| or postponed tonight, and I think the consensus was let's hear everyone who's come here to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| because that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| Mr. Grieve is not able to be here due to illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| We did reserve the notion that what if we heard the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| but didn't have the vote until the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| And I just want to bring that back up on the table, not to frustrate anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| but to have that opportunity to have a full panel voting on the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| I guess that's a motion to postpone the vote until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| I think a motion to postpone takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| On the substantive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| We've already made the amendment, but the substantive issue of the whole vote on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Right now we voted to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| And so the motion to postpone would now take precedence and would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Right now there's no second yet, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| I haven't heard one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| I think we'll resolve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Back to then Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| I wanted to ask Councilman Roddy if it's your intention to postpone to organize this convening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7113)|
| 1:58:42| of the stakeholders, then now would be the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| How do you propose we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| Well, I guess I thought to sponsor the ordinance that you might be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| You know, it's always good to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| Right now there's an amended motion on the floor that we're getting ready to move toward voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| I just need to clarify because Mr. Becker talked about two other amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| but he never made those motions for those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| We were hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| I don't want him to think he made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| No, I know it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| My hope would be that Mr. Whitehall heard my minor motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| And as this group is convening, this is language that can be talked about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| And my assumption is that we're going to have some form of changes after this group has met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7169)|
| 1:59:38| and that this would be part of that because these are very minor positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| And I'm assuming Mr. Whitehall heard that and is good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| But as Mr. Whitehall said, it's good to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| I heard eight ayes and zero noes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| Does that bring us to whether we're going to have a workshop or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Right now there's, yeah, not scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| Let me just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| I mean, my sense, Mr. Dell, about the workshop question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| is that if there are additional people Mr. Bailey wanted to do earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| if there's somebody else that would like to, they should let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| But I don't hear a consensus for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| 12D, an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| zoning regulations, Article V, Section 13, temporary uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| adding a provision for the use of goats for control of kudzu or other invasive plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| Can we use a check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| Second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| Mr. Dell, be careful now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| We've got goats and then sheep are coming up, so don't run out too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| I just want to say that I did visit the arboretum presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| and this is really a nicely run operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| They bring these animals in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| They have a protective dog to protect them from predators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| They have electric fences that they set up in the area where they're going to fight kudzu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| and I understand the proposal is to do this in two particular parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| so we're not unleashing goats across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| but we are bringing them in as environmental green workers to chew on kudzu plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| and eliminate these things without using herbicides or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| I think this really is a nice effort, and I certainly think we ought to give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| It's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| These folks have done it in Chattanooga and other places, and I just recommend it to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7311)|

| 2:02:57| Oh, that's 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| Being your first time, you need to give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7386)|
| 2:03:12| Jim Ulrich, 551 English Village Way, apartment 917, zip code 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7392)|
| 2:03:21| What I wanted to talk a little bit tonight about was the subject during your last, I think it was your last workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7401)|
| 2:03:35| which was on economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| It was not mentioned by anyone in those presentations, and I thought I'd bring it up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7419)|
| 2:03:52| Back in 2003, I think it was, I was at a conference somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| and there was a press conference given by an organization called Good Jobs First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7439)|
| 2:04:08| And what they did was presented a report that they had made, and the name of it was Missing the Bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7448)|
| 2:04:20| How States Fail to Connect Economic Development with Public Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7460)|
| 2:04:30| One of the things they did find out, it wasn't only states that didn't do it, it wasn't local governments either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7470)|
| 2:04:39| And like I say, that was back in the early part of this decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| but I don't think it's changed a whole lot since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| But let me give you a couple of comments they made in the executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| It's a 50-state survey of economic development subsidy programs reveals that not one single state effectively coordinates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7497)|
| 2:05:08| its economic development spending with public transportation planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| Now, when they talked to the people at the state level, they said a lot of this is done on a local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| so you might want to talk to people at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| And they did that in some of the states, and they found out they didn't do anything either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7526)|
| 2:05:34| So it isn't only a state, but it's also local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| Another thing they found out was that there was only four states that have any kind of system to collect even fragmentary data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7541)|
| 2:05:52| on corporate relocations that receive economic development incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| And their final conclusion was the fact we were unable to find any positive examples of economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7560)|
| 2:06:07| being integrated with transit highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| The fact that although transportation and development programs greatly affect each other, they remain profoundly balkanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7571)|
| 2:06:22| As states now face their worst in cities too, they feel that in order to maximize the return on taxpayer investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7582)|
| 2:06:40| that we should be looking at economic development with public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7600)|
| 2:06:48| The reason I bring this up is, like I say, nothing was mentioned on it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| The city has a public transit system, which I don't think we use in the city as well as in the area as an economic development tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7614)|
| 2:07:09| And I think it can be used that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| And I think it's desirable because one of the problems we have in the city, as you're all aware of, is where are the jobs going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7633)|
| 2:07:21| They're going out in suburbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| And how do people that live in the inner city or in the surrounding inner ring of suburbs get to those jobs unless they have an automobile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7644)|
| 2:07:41| So as you look at economic development, I would appreciate it if you also would look at public transit and see how those work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7661)|
| 2:07:54| And I think it might help our economic development in the city if we use that tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7674)|
| 2:08:07| Because we can't continue the way we're going now where, you know, it's all going out from the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7687)|
| 2:08:16| There was a couple of things that came up today that you voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7696)|
| 2:08:26| There was another study by the Urban Land Institute that talked about transportation and growth myths and facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7706)|
| 2:08:36| One of the myths is urban transportation major challenge is to improve commuting to downtown jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7716)|
| 2:08:45| In most growing areas, but the fact they came up with is, and this was back in the late 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7725)|
| 2:08:52| and I don't think it's changed any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| In fact, it's probably increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| In most growing areas, getting people to downtown jobs no longer is a major transportation problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| The problem is much more diverse, involving commutes made entirely within the suburbs, shopping, personal business trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7745)|
| 2:09:14| and off-hours traffic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| We made a we're making a slight move to it with putting an enhanced stop area out in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7759)|
| 2:09:33| But our transit system basically right now is to bring people downtown to jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7773)|
| 2:09:40| and the jobs are leaving downtown if no one's noticed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| So we need to rearrange our transit system to where it works with economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7786)|
| 2:09:54| and economic development works with the transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100615?start=7801)|
