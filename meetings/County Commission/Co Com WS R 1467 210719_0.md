| 0:03:41| In December of last year, my office began a national search for a permanent senior director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=221)|
| 0:03:53| After interviewing many qualified candidates from states including Michigan, Massachusetts, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Alaska, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, we were highly impressed by Mr. Joseph Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=233)|
| 0:04:07| We made him an offer and were delighted when he accepted the position in late April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| Joe is a 30-year Navy veteran.

| 0:05:06| So Joe, would you please come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=306)|
| 0:05:20| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=320)|

| 0:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| And if you could just speak right into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=329)|

| 0:06:13| It's a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| You can look out your window and see for miles in West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Can't really do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| But it's a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=386)|

| 0:07:23| and make sure that we prosecute those people so it becomes a deterrent and people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| and understand that that's something that won't be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=449)|

| 0:09:47| My name is Ted Hotz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| I'm the audit partner with Pew CPAs, and I reside at 9410 Westland Cove Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you, Mr. Hotz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Are there any questions for Mr. Jacobs or Mr. Hotz about the report that was sent or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| the audit from Pew and Company from any of our commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Perhaps just for the benefit of those listening, a brief summary about what your outcomes were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| We did a report where, following up, basically evaluating supply chain operations at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| We had excellent cooperation with the Health Department during our process, and our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| was to come up with recommendations to strengthen controls at the Health Department, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Our process involved interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| We reviewed the processes, tested processes, observed processes, and reviewed supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| It was an in-depth review, much more so than what happened during a course of a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| audit, but we were evaluating procedures at the Health Department, and as part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| you know, it would be expected for us to come up with recommendations for the level of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| that we did, and we have seven recommendations in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Mr. Jacobs, Mayor Jacobs, of those recommendations, do you know kind of what the status is of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| the implementation of those, and if there's a timeline for implementing all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| They all have already actually been implemented, and as far as each one, that would be a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| for Kevin or Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=689)|
| 0:11:40| If you could just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department, 140 Davern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Of the seven recommendations, we are in process, or will be finishing those, with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| of number seven, which involves a formal inventory control system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| We have to get costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| We asked hospital partners and some clinic partners what systems they're using and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| of that nature, so that would take a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| So the other six are completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| They're in the process and should be completed hopefully in the next two to three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Other questions for Mr. Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| The vaccine's coming in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| I know we're getting, what, 900 at a time or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| What's the, Dr. Bee, what's, how much is coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| I know it's slowed down a lot, so we're getting nowhere near, I'm sure, what we had in February or March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| So just give us an update of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Martha Buchanan, 140 Davern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| And the clinic on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| So we currently are not ordering any COVID vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| We're running through our supply that we had because uptake has diminished that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| We haven't ordered any COVID vaccine for several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Although it's available, we can order it when we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| We just haven't needed to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| So our usual vaccine supply actually gets drop-shipped to each clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| so it doesn't come into a center location and then get distributed out like we did with COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| because we had to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| So each clinic gets their own supply, and so as we pick back up on services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| we'll be ordering a vaccine on a regular basis from the state Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| And that varies anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| It's many less doses, you know, like 100 doses here or there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| as opposed to, you know, coming in at 975 doses at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| So that's changed quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| And, you know, we've onboarded a pharmacist to help with managing COVID vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| and also hoping to help use him as well to do some outreach around COVID vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| but also getting vaccinations into underserved populations in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| routine childhood vaccinations, and adult vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| So all of that's going really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| And Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Broadway was they ceased operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Kevin, I'm going to look at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| We ceased operations out there June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| We have since moved COVID vaccine into our main health department location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| for folks who want to come and get a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| We also have it available in our women's health clinic, in all of our other clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| So if you come in for other services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| you could get a COVID vaccine at the time you get those services as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| So we're able to meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| There's no wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| People are, you know, vaccines available just about everywhere and still free for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| So we were able to meet the demand at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| Are there additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Any of our team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you for the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| We'll get to public forum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And all of our honorary resolutions will be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| So we'll continue on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| We have four people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| I'll call first on Mr. Kevin Hill to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| Mr. Hill, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| Okay, Mr. Hill is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| So if you'll put up the timer for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| Five minute timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Ms. Stafford, if you would please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| And you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Yep, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Debbie Stafford, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I live in Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| I want to thank you all for having me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| I have had a number of patients come to me with a concern over the discussion of having a medical director of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| Some of the issues at play, I don't know how many of you all are aware that we don't even have a full-time school nurse in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| Some of the issues that come up, if you have a child with a seizure disorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| they may be ordered to have a diastat, which is a rectal suppository administered to their rectum if they go longer than five minutes without a seizure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=964)|
| 0:16:15| I've talked to teachers in the school system who have been asked to step up to volunteer for this insertion because there's not a school nurse full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=975)|
| 0:16:24| I just want to ask you all, if you're a parent, how do you feel about a non-trained person pulling down your child's pants in a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| and inserting something in their anus because there's not a school nurse available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| If you have a type 1 diabetic, especially with children, every growth spurt, every meal that they eat, every activity can impact their blood sugar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=995)|
| 0:16:46| And if they go low during the day, a hypoglycemic episode isn't going to wait for the school nurse to get over there from the other school they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| Now, me growing up in a medical field, third generation in health care, to me, checking blood sugar, doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| of course I'm a health care provider as well, it's not that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| But I've talked with teachers who said, I didn't sign up to be a health care provider, I signed up to be a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| So I've talked with parents who have had to send their children to a different school because they needed a full-time nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| And that violates children attending the school that they would attend if they did not have the health condition that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| So I'm a little perplexed as to why we're putting an MD in the school system when we still don't even have a nurse in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| And some people have said, well, nurses need to be overseen by doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| No, LPNs and RNs are independent practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| They are limited in that practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| They cannot do things that I can as an advanced practice nurse who requires an MD or DO oversight can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| But they follow orders that the child's primary care or specialist physician has provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| These parents are also telling me they're very concerned that if a medical doctor enters the school system, what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1071)|
| 0:18:00| Are these children now going to have their prescriptions challenged by someone that doesn't know their child's condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| Is the medical director now going to undo what sometimes a team of health physicians have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| health care providers have done to provide this child specialized care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| Because I would think that the number one issue in a school system would be the medically fragile children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| I talked to homeschoolers who are leaving Knox County schools in droves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| And to be honest, I've been pretty honest with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| I support that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Because it's pretty scary to know of a government overtaking your child's health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| And maybe that's not the intent, but we all know the slippery slope of government overstepping our boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| and how hard it is to get you all to give us back our freedoms once they've been taken from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| So if you want to do something to help the school system, give us school nurses in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| That's a huge step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| And then finally, I would like to finish with, if you're going to have someone overseeing a school system in a medical parameter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| why is it not a pediatrician?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| I'm the first one to be critical of the American Academy of Pediatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| But a zero to 21-year-old rate or 22 if they go the full time with an IEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| they need someone that's specialized in pediatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| I'm family practice myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| My expertise is not children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| I can provide a good quality level of care, but it's not my expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| pending the other additional CEUs that I've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| But I think these are just some of the questions that you all need to be asking yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| And I would like to add, I said that was my final thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| but you all should know I never hush when I say I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| Let's strengthen the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Health department does a lot of things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I had an adult come in with possible cancer to my clinic without insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| and the earliest she can get into Cherokee health is October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Now, if you think you have cancer, are you cool sitting around until October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| But I'm really tempted to take a second mortgage out so that I can go to a private physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| and get this issue addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| So as a county commission, you want to do something positive for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Strengthen our health department so that people can go to them for primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Health care should not be dictated by a school system to the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| It should be dictated by the parents working with the health care provider to deliver the care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Thank you, Ms. Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| If you would please state your name and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Before we do that, a memorandum of understanding between Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| and Knox County Health Department to provide an in-school health program for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| I see it as to fund a registered nurse, a nutritional facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| and a virtual behavioral health liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| I have no objection to the nurse, but a nutritional facilitator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Not quite sure what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| And a virtual behavioral health liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| And those three positions are to be paid over $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| If you don't see a problem with that, I certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| As Debbie stated, I think that would be better spent in putting nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| LPNs, and RNs in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Classrooms are overcrowded and school supplies are minimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| and Knox County Schools, through the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| wants to add more administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Whether they ask for the money directly or as I see it through the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| these are taxpayer dollars being used for more administration, more government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| The public has lost faith in the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| and most certainly in its leader, Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Recently she submitted a resolution to Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| to name her officially as medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Someone who is not a pediatrician does not hold, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| pediatric certification and hasn't seen a patient in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Yet she would have the ability to write prescriptions for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| without having seen them or knowing their medical background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| She certainly couldn't use a pediatrician on the Knox County Health Department staff since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| when she became director of the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| she farmed out all inpatient services to Cherokee health systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Perhaps this in-school health problem is another way to farm out responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| As I stated, we've lost faith in the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| and Martha Buchanan as its director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| It was very evident in last week's school board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| when during the item to name her as medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| there was almost no motion to take the matter up, and there was no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Even when it went to the second vote for consideration, it was voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| I also note on the agenda, as we heard earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| you were discussing the health department policies and procedures audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| Let me bring this to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| You've all seen the video on the news on the delivery of the vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| The box was placed on the loading dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| The driver rang the bell when someone signed for the delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| It was claimed that an employee signed for it but never saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Sometime later in the video, an open box was thrown into the dumpster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| It's been claimed that the box was inspected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| and the employee thought it was dry ice, so it was thrown away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| It is in no way or dry ice to consider a hazardous material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| and cannot be thrown away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| It has to be disposed of properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| If it is a case of lax policy for the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| the bet stops with Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Her lack of leadership skills and incompetence in her job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| have become quite apparent over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| It would be a disservice to the community and to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| to keep her in a position that she obviously does not have the skills to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Thank you, Ms. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Is Kevin Hill with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| We have the last person signed up for public forum is Vernon Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| He called and was running late, but I don't think he's joined us yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Mr. Henry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Moving forward in our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| we'll come back at the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| There's a second half of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| and if those two gentlemen are here, then we'll hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Madam Clerk, first item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| That's going to be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Post of those presentations will be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| So that puts us at approval of the minutes from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| First by Commissioner Buster, second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Drives on the road was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| What about line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| I don't think we have any, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| We don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| No budget amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| No budget amendments either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Spread of record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Spread of record is, spread of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1507)|

| 0:26:45| Talking to the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| we're not looking to add another paid holiday either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| We're looking to, you know, the mayor and his team will decide which one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| to exchange this one with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| That's basically the general idea or census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| Is there any questions on item number 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| To begin, my comments that I'm about to make are not in reference to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| specific holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| These comments are about holidays in general from the federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| state, and county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| It's nothing to do with what specific holiday it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| But in doing a quick recap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| the federal government has assigned ten holidays through last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| This year they've now moved it to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| The state of Tennessee has 13 holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and Knox County has mirrored those same 13 holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| So usually what's happened is when the federal government makes a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| then it's pushed down to the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| The states decide to adopt that federal holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| and then it goes to the next level, which is the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| And, of course, the reason that the state and county holidays don't line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1681)|
| 0:28:10| up with what the federal holidays, because they're less number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| is because they don't recognize Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| where the county and the state do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| So I can remember about 20 years ago when County Mayor Tommy Shumpert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| was considering adding another holiday to or Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| and at the time he said that that was a cost to the taxpayers of over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| So you'll notice in our statement here that we've got in our agenda that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| we're showing that it's a minimal fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| So I guess the question is if we have a 260 total workdays for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1730)|
| 0:28:59| employees, and then we're giving them 13 days off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| and then now this would be potentially the 14th day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| There is a cost, obviously, for any holiday to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| because you're closing the health department, the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Schools will not be affected on this particular one because it's during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Engineering and public works would be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Basically the only ones out there would be the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| So I guess are we jumping ahead of the game when the state normally says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1766)|
| 0:29:35| hey, we're going to vote, or the governor's going to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| this is now an official holiday, and in turn that they'd like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| counties to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Again, we're just discussing this, and that's why I wanted to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Just to address that, right now we currently have 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| and from talking to the mayor's team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| they're looking at taking one of those 12 out of the current rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| and putting this one into the rotation, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| So there won't be more holidays, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| or days off of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| There would just be a switch from Juneteenth will rotate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| and another holiday will rotate out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Okay, but we actually have 13 official holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| as recognized by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| So the same thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| There will still be 13 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| We'll drop one and rotate this one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| So there won't be any difference financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| It will just be taking one back and putting this one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| That's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| So you're saying that the mayor's office is willing to do that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| before next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| I'm not going to speak for the mayor himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| but when I talked to him and his team, this is what we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| If this does pass, then they'll handle it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Just remember, this is all ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| so it would still take another two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| And then it would have to go into effect in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| And I think you all know I always look at the numbers of what things cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| and so that's why when I heard it was a million dollars to do a holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| from years ago, I'm thinking, well, it's obviously a lot more today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| I think you have members of the mayor's team joining us at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| If you would please state your name and department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| So just to end the confusion, there's 12 holidays, not 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| So we have 12 holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| And so you've got a fiscal impact from me that said that there's minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| impact as it relates to the addition of a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| I would say the same thing if there was a reduction of a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| We budget for 260 days a year for every employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| The sheriff's office and our medical examiner's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| they use holidays as floating holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| So they take those holidays as they choose, usually in the same pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| So there is not an overtime consideration there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| The reason that it says it's a minimal impact is because if engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1925)|
| 0:32:13| and public works and parks and rec have people on standby on holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| if there were to be a storm or some sort of event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| then that would result in overtime, and that would be a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And so that's why there is minimal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| I think what County Executive Schumpert did then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I don't know how they budgeted for their days then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| but I think he just took what it took to run the county every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and divided it by 365 and said it's going to cost extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| But how we budget, there's not a fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you very much, Mr. Cullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| So we've got 12 holidays, and Commissioner Ward said we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| replace this one with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Do you know which one we're replacing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| That would be interesting to know before we take our final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| So ultimately I think what we have said from the beginning is we were waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| on guidance from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| We were trying to figure out what the state was going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| and so we still wait to see what the state is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| But I think if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| then what we would do is we would decide what those 12 holidays would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| When do you expect that from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| You know, Dwight made a phone call today to try to get some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| I don't know if it's on their radar screen that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| and so to see when they would acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| or have a determination on when that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Yeah, it would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| You know, are we putting the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| like Commissioner Stoonmaker said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| You know, hopefully next month we'll have a clearer understanding on what day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| we're replacing and any state guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Commissioner Beeley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Was Commissioner Smith before me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| We have the same chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I was looking left first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Yeah, I don't see any problem with this, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| I guess I have a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Does anyone anticipate that the state would declare this a holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and then replace another holiday with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| or would the state more than likely just declare this a holiday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| I've never known the state to replace a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| I think that's the question, right, is what's the state going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| You know, that's something else for our consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| and, Commissioner, you'll appreciate this from your former life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| is if we work and banks are closed or the state's closed, it's a problem, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| And so for us, it's important to get that guidance from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| to see that we try to work in conjunction with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| And I think for us, too, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| it's just the systematic thing of knowing what our public is going to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Because we serve the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| and so if the public is working and we serve them and we're off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| I don't think we're serving them as we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| I think ultimately what the mayor prefers is if you ask the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| he deems this should be a holiday, and he thinks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| And just what approach do we take as it relates to replacing it with a holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| or adding it and looking for guidance from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Sure. I understand. I would be fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| I think this should be a holiday, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| and I think that we may be a little ahead before we get state guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I was wondering if I could make a suggestion that would still recognize this as a holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| but not make it a paid day off yet until we get guidance from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| and then the mayor, because it's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| If you substitute another day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| you're going to want to get some feedback from the employee base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| So I wonder if we could just strike the desire to provide for Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| to observe the federal holiday each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| and that way if it takes two or three months for the state to hand down their advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| we still have this recognized in Knox County as a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Commissioner Skinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Mr. Caldwell, I think what the difference was on me recognizing 13 holidays is I think it's because we're counting Christmas Eve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2226)|
| 0:37:15| or depending on the way the calendar lays that that would not be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| And that's where the extra day came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| But we do, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Yeah, 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Is there additional discussion on Item 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| There's a motion on the floor to move forward with our recommendation, continue our discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| Okay, this is a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| So do we roll call a move forward with that recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Or do we just roll call to forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| We can do a voice vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| We can do a voice vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Yeah, just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Commissioner Smith, are you making an amendment to it at this time or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| No, I'm just suggesting that maybe for next week if we by chance don't get any information from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| just an idea we'll throw out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I don't think it would be a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| It's the first reading anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| All those in favor of moving forward to next week without recommendation, first by Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2299)|

| 0:38:47| and add a new Section 27-16 entitled Use of Tobacco and Vapor Products Prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2327)|

| 0:39:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Yeah, this is just a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| If you remember, about this time last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| we voted that there would be no smoking in the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and the state had somehow left out vaping and other tobacco products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| and they went and corrected their ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| and it became public chapter this year that they've added all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| So all we're doing is really mirroring what the state has already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Is there a discussion on item number 46?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| There is a motion on the floor, first from Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| second from Commissioner Schoonmaker, to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| We'll do a roll call vote on that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Item 47, Ordinance 104, is amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Article 2, Division 2, entitled Employees' Merit System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| to provide for various amendments to Section 42-53, entitled Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| This amends Ordinance O-90-9111, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| Ordinance O-91-8-114, adopted November 25, 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2455)|

| 0:41:06| And Ordinance O-19-101, adopted February 25, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I'll make a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I'll do a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you all for participating in last week's Chairman's Briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| We spent several hours walking through these proposed ordinance changes in a quite detailed way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| Good suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I believe every suggestion that was brought to the table last week has been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| You got a new copy that has been given to you with the highlighted sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| And this is obviously the first of each of the four total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| I appreciate everybody weighing into this and getting more involved and understanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| And I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Commissioner Durek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I was able to participate in the original ad hoc committee for this and have been really involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| And in doing some research regarding the Merit Council, as I did not know what it did ahead of becoming county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| I did reach out to previous sheriffs and actually asked if Sheriff Hutchinson would be able to come and answer any questions that we may have as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2549)|
| 0:42:45| Unfortunately, he was unable to attend this evening due to a family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| But he did send me a letter to read to us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| And so I will do that on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Can you also mail that or give that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Or we can post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I will send it to Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| It says, Dear Commissioners, I've been asked to provide a small history of my experience with the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| I apologize for not appearing in person as a current personal family problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Precludes that from occurring today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I went to work at the sheriff's office January 5th, 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| The Merit System was quite new then and had not started doing their own civil service testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| I had to go take my test at the City of Knoxville Civil Service Board, who then provided testing for Knox County Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| The Merit System is there to prevent politics from Knox County being able to maintain a professional office with a professional staff of officers for patrol, corrections, and courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2621)|
| 0:43:54| As did the two sheriffs following my terms of office, Jones and Spangler, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| We all worked under and enjoyed being protected by the Merit System from political influence throughout our careers prior to being elected sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| And then he follows with some bullets, just kind of informational about his experience with Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| Merit System was established by state legislation to prevent a sheriff from firing or punishing at will, as was typically done in the early 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| Especially when new sheriffs were elected and took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Merit System was established to have sheriff's offices across Tennessee become more professional and keep the experienced officers in the department protecting the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| Merit System is set to provide testing and interviews for all applicants to remove political favoritism for select applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| It is paramount for the officers and employees to have a right to a hearing if there is a perceived wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| Removing these protections leaves them feeling lost with no hope and will only make matters worse in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| Removing their protection may leave them feeling their only choice is to seek a union to represent them, as was considered with the Teamsters Union in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2695)|
| 0:45:04| Promotional testing is provided by the Merit System to ensure no political intervention or favoritism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| Nothing now precludes the sheriff's office from recruiting as we did when I was sheriff and as the sheriff's office should have been doing the last couple of years with a large number of employees leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2711)|
| 0:45:21| Adding more Merit System members is nothing more than trying to pack the board for favoritism to one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| If more is better, then why did we reduce the Knox County Commission from 19 to 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| If you want to compare what other jurisdictions have in leadership areas, remember Nashville has a 40-member council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| A three-member Merit System board with an alternate is quite adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| To my knowledge, I nor any prior sheriff have ever fought or sought to change the Merit System rules or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| It is paramount for the sheriff and staff to work with the Merit System, not fight them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| The Merit System council members have been very professional and they do not deserve any attack as they are selected and appointed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| It is incumbent upon commission to stand behind and protect the board members you have chosen from these attacks and overzealous politics and leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| He concludes with the Merit System staff has done an outstanding job trying to keep applicants on the eligibility list during this time of unprecedented numbers of officers leaving the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2773)|
| 0:46:24| I would urge each of you commissioners to resist this assault on the Merit System members and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| They are there to prevent exactly what is happening at this time, a political takeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| Sincerely, Sheriff Tim Hutchison, retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| And so, as I said, I will be sure to get that to Drew so everyone has a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| Thank you, Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Is there other discussion on item number 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| My question is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So, in this, it shows that you're wanting to move to compose the body of five voting members, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| So, if this does pass to go on to next month, will the things that are on the Merit Council right now, will it be retroactive and go back or will it just be from this moment forward if we move to a five person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2826)|
| 0:47:21| It doesn't go from this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| If you pass it, it would start only when you pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| So, anything from September forward, the five person body would be here, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| I think an ordinance is 30 days after they pass, so it may even be October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| So, October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| It would be the end of September, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Yeah, end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| I'm trying to calculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Yeah, end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| That's one of the things that I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Other discussion on Item 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| There is a motion to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Jay, seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2874)|

| 0:48:06| We will move forward to next week for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Item 48 is Ordinance 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 2, entitled Employees' Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| To establish requirements for the conduct of merit system council meetings in Section 42-54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2900)|

| 0:48:33| I'll offer a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Is there a discussion on Item 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Mr. Law Director, did you look into there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I believe there were some questions about ADA and HIPAA privacy on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| They are covered under the confidentiality, which is the last section of the Merit Council rules right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2939)|
| 0:49:09| So I think that if that doesn't cover it all, then we can modify the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| because the rules come back before you, but there is a very strong confidentiality provision in the rules present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| But you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Now, it's up to the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| If they want to present their medical records in front of the quasi-judicial body, that's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2967)|
| 0:49:35| If they don't want to, certainly, then it shall remain confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| Commissioner Durett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I'm sorry, did you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Commissioner Durett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I'm kind of adding on to that a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| What if, let's say, for example, someone did want the quasi-judicial body to hear their medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=2990)|
| 0:50:00| I don't want to say medical records, but whatever it is that could potentially pertain to the grievance, but it not be televised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3000)|
| 0:50:11| Is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Could they essentially, in that sense, enter into the Executive Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| Well, number one, the rules are, this doesn't change the rule any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| Presently, they're under that confidentiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| What I just said is the present rule no matter whether you pass this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| This doesn't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Now, to answer your question, you can't go into executive session because that only applies in very limited circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| The only possibility, and I would not render an opinion one way or the other, a judge, if you have something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3039)|
| 0:50:50| you can make an application for the judge and file something in the record that is not to go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| and the judge can enter an order one way or the other and say, okay, and perhaps this body has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| But, no, you can't have a secret meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| And the public, I think you would get a lot of, my gut is that you'd get a lot of hassles, as it were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3068)|
| 0:51:19| and rightfully so from the press and the public as to why the merit system either abided by the sheriff's recommendation or didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3079)|
| 0:51:29| And it's got to go up on appeal one way or the other anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, that's kind of broad, but I don't have a more specific answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| That's the rule as it stands right now, and this doesn't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Additional discussion on number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3103)|

| 0:57:13| I oppose the adding of June 19th to the county list of holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| The holiday was rammed through the national level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| through an executive order by a current illegal administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| It has not been approved at a state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| and therefore should not be added at a county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Please take the time to view a couple of dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| August 18th, 1920, 19th Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| the right to allow women to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| Look at September 2nd, 1945, official date at the end of World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| All of these dates affect us, and yet we have no holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| These two dates have different effect on all of us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| They're considered just dates and holiday, to be forgotten forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| never mentioned in history classes in the United States classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Now we're pushing to accept a resolution to adopt this date locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| Is this not an attempt to be politically correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| to appease a small, loud group willing to resort to violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| if not given their way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Instead, why not recognize exceptional individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| that have been a valuable part of our nation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3505)|

| 0:58:48| Why not recognize a day of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| that have actually done something for our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| our society, our communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| As a true Native American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| not one day is celebrated for my culture, nor even noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Truth be told, we've not requested one, we've not demanded one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| We are not a tail wagging the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| As a matter of fact, most of us that I've had the privilege of speaking with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| want nothing other than two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| We want to be left alone, and we don't want you to send us any more blankets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| This culture, this country, like all countries of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| has issues of one sort or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Giving a holiday to the tail wagging the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| is like putting a Band-Aid on a rusher's spleen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| The country needs to come together, be a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| for we all know what that stands for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Together we each achieve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| We should not be a culture of spoiled children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| who feel the need for a trophy for just being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| We've lost our ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| because we have lost the ability not to practice the act of smiling at one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| civility, politeness, or common courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| Maybe we should all exercise an act of kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| So before you vote on that, look at the whole concept, just not the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| Thank you for the exception in giving me the time to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Be safe, be well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3620)|

| 1:00:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| While I put this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| we're going to probably recognize Dr. Collier later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| in a few weeks or so respectfully in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| This man I got to know early on when I started running for county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| a very giving person, a person that really enjoyed his history here in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| and he wanted to share that with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| I got to walk the property before it was ever like it is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| when you had to walk through poison ivy and other things to get down to the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| where he got water to bring to his grandmother for them to cook and wash and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| and part of the barn was still standing, a beautiful piece of property in the raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| But he came together and gave this property through Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| so it could be preserved for all to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| Not too long ago, somebody walked through there with a can of spray paint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| and sprayed something vulgar on the new bridge, beautiful new wooden bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| and sprayed something vulgar on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| So the rest of us could not really enjoy it because we couldn't take the kids through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| that could read what was on that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| When I first saw it and heard about it, I went down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| and there was a lot of people and a lot of people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| that volunteered to make what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| And it made me so angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| If I could have found whoever did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| I would have confronted them and probably caused some physical violence to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| His hair used to be red, and my temper was really at its top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| because someone else wants to take away the joy that someone had wanted to give to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| They wanted to take it away from us because they had a can of black spray paint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| and to face part of that beautiful park on that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| I have the next item down here about civility that I was going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| but I'm not going to talk about it because I don't think we are losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| or we have it anymore in this county because no one wants to take care of each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| or respect each other's rights to enjoy somebody else's gift to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| And until we get that back, I don't know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3797)|
| 1:03:25| We can't even have civil conversations with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| And I don't know what else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| People, we can't even talk to one another anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| We can't even show respect anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| And I guess that's what bothers me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| In the seven years I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| I have never seen this go in the way that we've gone in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| We used to be able to talk on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| even really have really strong discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| But when the gavel dropped, we were friends again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| It was discussion only instead of taking it personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| And the lack of showing each other respect has gone to a new level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| and I've kind of fell in that lately too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| to not show respect to some other people around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| But I just wanted to say that about this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| This man was disrespected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| even though he was showing love to the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| And to do that, to deface it, was just beyond belief to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| So that was my discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| I want to publicly say an apology to the family for what this idiot did to that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Commissioner Vestal, you have items 52 and 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| Would you like to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| On the thing about civility, again, I don't want to talk to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| Can we just take that off the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| I just want to leave that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| But the next thing I want to talk about is something positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| You know my love of the Three Ridges Golf Course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210719?start=3913)|
