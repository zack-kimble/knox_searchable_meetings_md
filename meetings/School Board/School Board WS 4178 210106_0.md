| 0:01:43| Our January meetings were pushed forward one week due to winter break, so our regular...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| Okay, Betsy, can you still hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Okay, just turn your mic on if you need us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| Okay, and there are, typically we have the agenda up on the screen, but so that Ms. Henderson, so that we can see her, we don't have that up there this evening, but we do have hard copies in the other room if anyone needs a hard copy of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=118)|
| 0:02:13| Thank you to our law department representatives who met with us in executive session this afternoon at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=133)|

| 0:02:26| Yes, thanks, Madam Chair, happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| An exception to the Tennessee open meeting law is when the board needs to meet with attorneys concerning legal matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=148)|
| 0:02:37| In this case, the Knox County Board of Education meets with the Knox County Law Department, and there's a couple cases that apply to that, both to pending legal matters and to anticipated legal matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=157)|
| 0:02:50| and that's Smith County Education versus Anderson and Van Hoosier versus Warren County Board of Education. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Board members, as you are aware, Senator Becky Duncan-Massey and I are hosting an electronic meeting this Friday, January 8th, at 9 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| to provide an opportunity for us to speak with our state legislators about current and upcoming educational issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| The meeting will be live streamed on the KCS website and broadcast live on Comcast Cable Channel 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| I also wanted to mention that I will continue to follow up on our annual workshop discussion regarding the superintendent evaluation timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| and I plan to include that topic on our January 27th quarterly work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| Do we have any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Madam Chair, if I may, I would like to add a very brief explanation of the documents that I handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| Okay. We can do that at the very end after regular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| All right. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| Okay. Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| We have a motion by Mr. McMillan, a second by Ms. Satterfield. Any discussion? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Okay. Mr. McMillan, would you like to share with us your thoughts on our vision and mission statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| Thank you, Madam Chair. I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Since our mission is to provide excellent learning opportunities for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| I wanted to share some up-to-date information from my district about the Career Magnet Academy, or CMA as it's commonly referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=276)|
| 0:04:50| It was a short time ago that this school was being considered for possible closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| so I thought it would be very appropriate to spotlight their accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| Let me just stop there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| There was one person in leadership on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| and some of the supervisors who were very much in favor of closing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=316)|
| 0:05:25| because it was costly and it was not doing what we originally intended it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=325)|
| 0:05:36| And some of the kids came here, came down, testified, and the board rallied around what they were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=336)|
| 0:05:51| Now, I don't know. There's no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Had they not been here, it probably would have been closed, would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| But the board, after listening attentively, rallied around what they were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=361)|
| 0:06:11| and not only did we keep it open, we changed the direction, the leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| and it's an entirely different thing today from what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| And it's something that we can all be really proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| Obviously, I'm proud of it because it's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| But it's open to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| It's closer to our kids in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=397)|
| 0:06:45| But I just want to tell you a little bit more about it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=405)|
| 0:06:53| CMA has transitioned from a career path model to an early college model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| due in part to its strengthened partnership with Pellissippi State Community College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| Even in the midst of this challenging year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| CMA has been able to continue its goal of providing a true college experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| for its students and to prepare its new students for how to be successful when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=439)|
| 0:07:28| And I have about four achievements here that, if you'll bear with me, I'd like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| During the 2020 fall semester, 641 college credit hours were earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| with 81 dual-enrollment students participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| including 85% of the eligible juniors and seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| In the spring of 21, 101 dual-enrollment students are on track to earn 939 credit hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=478)|
| 0:08:11| That includes over a third of the sophomores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| And for 2021 school year, that's a total of 1,580 college credit hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=496)|
| 0:08:28| spread out over approximately 526 college courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=508)|
| 0:08:38| Now this is the part that the parents should love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| This achievement saved the parents $260,000 in college tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=522)|
| 0:08:53| And finally, CMA currently has 12 seniors who will be graduating with their associate's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=533)|
| 0:09:03| from Pellissippi the week before they graduate from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| I hope this positive report and news assures the board that CMA continues to be a good investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| as they provide excellent learning opportunities for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| And I also wish to thank Principal Matt Mosley for providing me with this updated information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=564)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Great. Thank you, Mr. McMillan. That's great to hear. Very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Okay. Mr. Thomas, we'll have the superintendent's report now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| Thank you, Madam Chair and board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| I'd like to again welcome all of our students and staff back for spring semester that began yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| I know that in our current environment, many of our students, families, and employees have questions about the district's plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| Let me first say we're working very hard to protect the health and well-being of our school communities just as we did in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| We'll continue to require masks in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Everyone who enters a school building must have their temperature checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| We're also continuing cleaning and sanitation protocols that were added prior to the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| We believe these strategies helped us be successful in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| and they will allow us to safely provide virtual and in-person instruction during the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Of course, the vaccine, the teachers, educators have been moved up on the priority list for the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| So we'll have a plan in place to make sure that all of our educators have the opportunity to wish to take the vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| and encourage them to do so as soon as that can possibly happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| Right now, we don't know for sure in terms of when it will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| We're looking maybe at the end of February, early March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Hopefully, maybe something will be available earlier than that, but that's what we know right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| And I want to reiterate the importance of following the five core actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| and those are observe physical distancing, wear a mask in public, practice proper handwashing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| clean and sanitize surfaces, and stay home if you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| And we need the support of all Knox County residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| so I'm asking that each of us take these steps to help protect our school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| I'd also like to take a few minutes and speak to the opportunity we have before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| to unite as educators and public servants on behalf of our students and schools across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Last month, the Board of Education approved its legislative priorities for 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| and members of the Board will be discussing these very critical needs with our legislative delegation on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| These include fully funding the BEP, additional funding to increase teacher salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| and holding educators harmless in the evaluation process this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Along with my counterparts in Metro Nashville, Shelby County, and Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| I had the opportunity to share our needs during yesterday's panel discussion with the House Democratic Caucus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| and let me just say thank you to all the members of the Democratic Caucus that met with us virtually yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| to provide us this opportunity to share with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| and all four superintendents of four largest school districts had an opportunity to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| Additionally, I and my regional counterparts within the Tennessee Organization of School Superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| continue to have discussion, share ideas, and strategize on how we can emphasize to lawmakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| the urgency to meet the needs of our students and schools across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| As you're aware, Governor Lee has called for the Tennessee General Assembly to convene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| for a special legislative session on the 19th of this month, that's less than two weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| to address major challenges the state's public schools are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| For almost a year, this pandemic has created what likely has been the largest disruptions to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| in our nation's history, changing the way we must deliver K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| In Knox County, we anticipate unbudgeted COVID-related costs to exceed $10 million by the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| These expenditures are primarily due to the purchase of personal protective equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| and the commitment we made to provide a virtual learning option for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Many of these costs will be recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| This does not include the $5 to $7 million of anticipated annual costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| related to sustaining our one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| As we get into budget conversations with you, we'll talk more about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| but $5 to $7 million of recurring costs just to sustain the one-to-one initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| which I'm sure is going to stay in place once the pandemic is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| And certainly, again, thankful to the Board and the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| and also the federal dollars that came through the CARES Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| for allowing us to become a one-to-one school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| But we are in an educational crisis now more than ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| and we're asking our governor and state legislature to make the education of our students a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| As a board, we're asking our state legislative bodies to determine the full impact on public school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| with respect to any and all proposed legislation for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| This is vitally important as we urge the Tennessee General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| to hold harmless reductions in student enrollment such that BEP funding will not be negatively impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| Since average daily membership is the primary component which generates state education funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Knox County schools could stand to lose almost $8 million of BEP funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| absent any hold harmless provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| Coupled with the growing budgetary needs resulting from the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| this could be crippling to the academic success of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| And just to put that in perspective, we compared the third 20-day enrollment period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| membership period of last year with the third period this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and we were down about 2,200 students from the same membership period from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| So again, that could equate to about $8 million of lost funding absent of a hold harmless provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| The need for student interventions is urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Currently, the state funds only 41% of our costs related to intervention teachers and coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| a gap of approximately $1.2 million that has to be covered through a combination of local and federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| We anticipate this to widen as the need for enhanced student intervention programs continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| The funding gap is even worse when it comes to school nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| positions especially vital now considering the state of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| In real funding, which means adjusted for the BEP fiscal capacity component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| money from the state provides one school nurse for every 4,500 students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| However, the National Association of Nurses, the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and the American Association of Pediatrics recommends a nurse for every 750 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| To fully fund these positions, the state would need to provide about $3.6 million more to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| We're also keenly aware of the growing need for student mental health supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| and one of our board's legislative priorities is to seek additional funding in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| For instance, the funding gap for school psychologists alone is around $2.5 million and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| We have additional concerns with respect to inadequate resources for guidance counselors and social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| For example, in real dollars, the state provides, through the BEP formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| one guidance counselor for every 790 students in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| The American School Counselor Association recommends one guidance counselor for every 250 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| To fully fund these positions, the state would need to provide roughly $11.5 million more to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| Likewise, in real dollars, the state funds one social worker for every 3,700 students in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| The National Association of Social Workers recommends one social worker for every 250 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| To fully fund these positions, the state would need to provide an additional $16 million more through the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| A similar dynamic occurs with funding our teaching positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| In real dollars, the state funds roughly half of our 4,000 teachers in our general operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| Obviously, we need significantly more state funding in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| Over the coming weeks and months, the Tennessee General Assembly will have the opportunity to unite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| on behalf of the 960,000 public school students and their families across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| to send a clear message that Tennesseans prioritize the education of our children and youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| The research has cleared that there is a correlation between educational attainment and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| The future of our community and the future of our state is only as successful as our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| We realize that education is not the only issue that Governor Lee and our legislators will be contemplating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| but we urge all of them to make decisions that will provide much-needed financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| to all school districts across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Yeah, I do have a question for you, and I thank you for that whole update about the finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| but this is about the vaccination because we talk about educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| and I'm hoping that that is a broader vaccination program that will deal with custodians, food service workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| and I don't know if that's been made clear or not or if we even know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| but I hope that we can push that everyone that's actually in the school on a regular basis is able to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| And I think a great point, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| I think what the wording reads, and I'll look to Scott for this, but all staff, Scott, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| So which would include what we would encourage to happen, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| is all staff, including the custodial staff and teacher assistants and everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| have that opportunity to receive the vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Superintendent Thomas, I can validate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| I was on a call today with Michelle Fizer, who's the doctor who's overseeing the plan for Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| and she made that very point that it is anybody who's interacting within the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| So I think that's great that that's part of the plan and that teachers and staff have been elevated up to 1B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| which she also gave a rough timeline of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Of course, there's no promises, but it seems like that could come as early as late February and early March in terms of timing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| We appreciate you making sure that we have the correct information, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Superintendent Thomas, I have another question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| and it's really related to the decision to move back to in-person instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| So we all know if anybody's been following the news and what's been happening locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and what's been happening in our health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| you can't look very far without seeing people say, rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| for a period that Knox County is potentially the worst county in the world in terms of COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| And, you know, that's shifted and ebbed and flowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| and I think there's three more now in other parts of the country that are worse than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| And we also know that the last time that this board met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| the decision was made right prior to it to move to a week of virtual instruction before the end of school this past semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| And I would never want to be in your position to make that call to whether or not we come back in-person instruction in a situation like this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| And I have no doubt that you and your team took a tremendous amount of time and energy to make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| I think it's also important for the public to be fully aware of why the particular call was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| And my intent in this question is not to question the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| but to say this is why we made the decision that we made, because I think it's important for people to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| I know the day we left this meeting last time, I got a tremendous amount of e-mails saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| why in the world did you go to virtual instruction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| And then I've received over 50 e-mails in the last week saying, why in the world are you going back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| So it doesn't matter what, you know, there's people on all kinds of sides of every issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| But I think it's important for the public to understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| what is the information that was used to make that call and why was that call made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Okay. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Watson, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| We did, over the holidays, over the break, winter break, look at as much of the information that was made available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| We looked at, obviously, let me talk about some of the information not available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| Of course, student attendance rates were not available when we were not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| Also, bus driver attendance rates, not something we could look at as one of our metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| Cafeteria workers not in school, so we're not looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| Custodial rate we could look at, obviously because they were working over the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| And substitute fill rate was not something that was available either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| So some of the metrics that we used to make the decisions were not available at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| So what did you use to make the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| One piece of information that was available, and I think critical to the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| was actually to look at our teacher and school-based attendance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| We were able to look at that over the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Obviously, it could have changed and probably did change some over the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| But what we were seeing, the trend being in terms of our teacher attendance rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| was around 95-96%, which is, for us, anything above 90% is green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| And again, I know Mr. Bolton monitored that data over the holidays looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| which it in fact ended up correlating with what we were seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| because the attendance rate, I think Monday wasn't a student day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| but the attendance rate Monday was somewhere between 96-97%, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| School started Tuesday, yesterday, so I think we were, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| right around a 96% attendance rate with our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| And today, I believe we were 95.17% in terms of our teacher-rate attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| So looking at teacher-rate attendance, it appeared that even though the numbers are going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| in terms of the community, it appeared that we weren't going to have some of the operational issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| opening school that we were faced with when we made the decision to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| or to, I won't say close, we didn't close, we went virtual, so we still had school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| But obviously, the substitute fill rate, if you've got a staff at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| you're going to need fewer substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| And today, what we were seeing, our substitute fill rate is still not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| It's 67%, but it's several percentage points higher than it was when we made the decision to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| I think we look at 70%, or less than 70%, I think, being read for our fill rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| So again, it's a little bit lower, but I think the last time it was that high was around October 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| So even though our percentage rate is not great, it was still higher than what it was when we made the decision to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| Another factor we looked at and considered, and we look at daily, and it's not on the metric sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| is the rolling seven-day average for COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| And I think during the week that we were virtual, that rolling seven-day average was up to 500-plus new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1475)|
| 0:24:46| And looking at that over the break, I think along about Christmas, maybe that number started declining, going down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1486)|
| 0:24:55| So it's still, the new cases, it's still much higher than what we would like for it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| But I think as of yesterday, it was 284 when we made the decision to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| I believe it was like 432.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| So it was about a 34% decrease in the seven-day rolling average of new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| So those are, and plus, we made a commitment to the parents of 45,000 students that we would give it our best shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1517)|
| 0:25:26| best opportunity if we could safely reopen schools, that we would do so for the parents and the students, 45,000-plus students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1526)|
| 0:25:35| So those were the things we looked at over the period of the holidays that helped us, I guess, to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| And as I've said, all that could change tomorrow or Friday or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| I don't know. I mean, I don't have a crystal ball to forecast that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| We've all heard the predictions that after Christmas or because of the break that the increases are going to spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1552)|
| 0:26:00| And I know we're seeing that community-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| But right now, in terms of the school system, we're, as of today, in really good shape, I feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1562)|
| 0:26:12| And we'll continue to look at that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I appreciate you taking a moment to dive into all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I know no leader wants to always justify their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| But I also know that in an environment like this, there is real fear on the behalf of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| And I think it's important for them, whether or not they agree with the decision or not, to know why the decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| So thank you for taking that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| And thank you. I appreciate you asking the question, too, Mr. Washington. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Regarding the safety protocols, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| It kind of seems to me that some people are very comfortable and confident in the way things are being handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| But then you do hear these pockets where very general, you know, well, my school isn't doing this, or my school isn't, you know, enforcing this like another school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1612)|
| 0:27:06| I guess I'm curious as to what procedures we have in place or how people can reach out to the district to voice those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1626)|
| 0:27:19| Because, I mean, there is fear about voicing them because I think everybody knows that teachers and staff are doing the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1639)|
| 0:27:29| And they don't want to, you know, feel like they're being overly critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| But there are general concerns about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So I'm just curious, you know, where do those people go and how do they go about reporting concerns they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1658)|
| 0:27:47| Let me be sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Concerns that parents might have about their school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Masks being enforced or any of their safety guidelines, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| Certainly, if it's an issue student-related, I would encourage our grade-level directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| I think, of course, obviously the principal is the first contact that I would encourage folks to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| And then after that, our grade-level directors, Mr. Danny Trent for secondary, Mrs. Julie Thompson for elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| if there are issues around those, if it's student-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| In our policy, we do have some consequences for if that's not being enforced or students are not following our face mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1707)|
| 0:28:37| I know a verbal warning is, I think, the first consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| And maybe the second consequence, also a verbal warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Once it gets past the second, I think contacting a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| It could be a situation, well, first of all, quarantine from the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| So if the school has a place to isolate a student who refuses to wear a mask, then to isolate that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| And then a parent pickup could also be requested if a student wishes or continues to not follow the face mask policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1740)|
| 0:29:10| From an employee standpoint, I would suggest that Mr. Bolton contact Human Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| if we have employees that are not following the face mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| I think in our policy we refer to the civility code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| I believe that it's a violation of the civility code if an employee is not following the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| And then also, I think there's a reference to the employee complaints and grievance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| And those two policies, the civility code is B230, employee complaints and grievances is G130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| So we would go through with an employee, I'm assuming, Scott, to help correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| but a corrective disciplinary process with the employee for violation of the board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1795)|
| 0:30:05| OK. All right. All right. Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, ma'am. OK, now I would like to introduce Ted Hoats from Pew CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1810)|
| 0:30:20| He's going to update us on the internal school funds audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Thank you so much for being here. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I will try this with the mask as long as I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| I believe recently or earlier this week we sent out a copy of the internal school funds audit report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| So each of you should have that electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Obviously, it's a big report, a few hundred pages, so a lot of reading in there if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| A lot of numbers in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Basically, the activity funds covers only the activity at the schools, does not cover activity at central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| But by activity at the schools, that means everything that runs through the checking account at each individual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| so all roughly 90 schools, includes the receipts, monies collected by teachers, administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| disbursements predominantly by check, ticket events, athletic events, school plays, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| So a lot of activity runs through these activity funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| We conduct our work in the summertime predominantly and wrap it up early fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| communicate findings to the bookkeepers and the supervisor of internal school funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| and then we start working on the report, which takes a little while as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| During our testing, we test activity, multiple transactions at each school in all aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| So it's a healthy amount of testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| and basically we take over a room in the Sarah Simpson building for a couple months to get that work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| In your audit report, I'll walk you through that pretty quickly, or at least certain aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| Initially, I think it's Roman numeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| I don't want to use the pages at the very bottom because I don't have the PDF pages with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| Roman numeral 2 to Roman numeral 4 is our audit opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| and as a warning, it's a unique audit opinion because it basically says that the report is not in agreement with GAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1945)|
| 0:32:34| General Accepted Accounting Principles, but instead is in agreement with the Tennessee Accounting Policy Manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| which is what we're required to be in compliance with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| We follow the Tennessee Accounting Policy Manual, and it is a clean opinion in regards to that manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| And we'll note that a year ago, we actually had two schools where there were exceptions to that because of record-keeping regarding receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| So it's good that we're back to a true, clean opinion for fiscal year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| And I don't know if I said this earlier, but the period covered was last school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| After the audit opinion on pages 1 through 4 is really a summary of the balance sheet on the first two pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=1997)|
| 0:33:26| and then a summary of the income statement on the next two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| And while there's a bunch of—well, individual transactions are not significant in what we audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| at least from a dollar perspective, total dollars are very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| The total cash held at the end of the year between all schools was roughly $11.9 million, so a healthy amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2022)|
| 0:33:51| As far as revenues coming in and out for the school year, revenues were $18.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| And this is down from about $20 million or just over that the year before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| but obviously it was an interesting year with COVID impacting the latter part of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2042)|
| 0:34:11| So that's why the numbers are a little bit down if you're comparing numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| at least from a revenue expense standpoint to the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| What gets a lot of attention in this report—well, I'll get to that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| After those first four pages, then you have basically individual balance sheets and income statements for all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| So every school will have its own balance sheet and income statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| And then there's schedule of supplemental payments made, schedule of inter-fund transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| And then you get to the very back of the report, which is the compliance section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| which is the section which garners the most attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| So part of it is we are testing all these transactions, so we have to report what findings we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2088)|
| 0:34:57| And the findings start on page 331 and go through page 342.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| And I'll recap what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Segregation of duties is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| And I guess just as an overall, findings are up slightly from a year ago as far as number of instances across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2109)|
| 0:35:20| Not in every category, and I'll talk about that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| But when you consider that, you know, in early to mid-March, we went virtual and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| trying to catch up with accounting policies and authorizations, it did make it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| So I think it's kind of understandable that we had some areas where findings increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| Segregation of duties is one area that went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| We had 47 schools that had a segregation of duties exception down from 55 a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2146)|
| 0:35:55| And really, a few years prior to that, we were at about 80 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| So this is one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| You know, it's difficult to have a perfect system of accounting controls when you basically have a bookkeeper and a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2161)|
| 0:36:10| But there's been a concerted effort to make the controls as strong as possible in many of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| So the fact that we have an exception in this area that's continuing to decline, I think, is a very positive note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| And that's the root of all potential issues is not having segregation of duties the way you would like them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| Because if controls are in place, it's harder for something that shouldn't happen to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| Second finding, it dealt with negative fund balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| And there were about four cases this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| I think it's approximately what it was a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Disbursements is the third area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| And disbursements were down slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| 63 schools had a challenge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| And keep in mind, we're testing about 20 transactions at each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| So disbursements might mean there wasn't a proper authorization or wasn't supporting invoice for an item that we tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2226)|
| 0:37:15| Receipts had 58 exceptions, which is up from 47 schools the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| Purchase orders, slightly up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Ticket reconciliations, about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| We had issues at six schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Fundraising activities had issues in about half the schools, which is up a little bit from the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| And fundraising and resale activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| School support organizations continue to be a challenge as far as having them registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Approval of transfers is an accounting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| We didn't see any issues with the transfers that were made, but there is an approval process in place that was a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| Travel policy is an area that was a significant issue a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| And a new process was put in place, I want to say, two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| And we're down to just seven issues at seven schools where it was much higher than that a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| And unclaimed property regulations regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| But those are the areas pretty much similar to what we had a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Although, as I mentioned earlier, we had an exception at two schools for lack of receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Lack of documentation receipts in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| And that was corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So that's an encouraging thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| And it gets you to where you're back to having your standard audit report for all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| A lot of information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| I'll open up for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I will say the audit wouldn't be possible without the help of Garrett and his team, Heidi Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| We have regular contact with the bookkeepers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| We don't have contact with them during the summer while they're off, but when they're back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| As soon as they come back to school, not only do they have to meet with the principal and everything getting ready for the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| they have to deal with us too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| And results are also discussed with management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Garrett and Ron McPherson and the superintendent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| So as auditors, we're pleased to see the involvement of management in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2372)|
| 0:39:42| Okay. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| We don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2384)|

| 0:40:13| I've included a brief refresher of the KCS GRAD agreement for the benefit of new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| In 2018, KCS entered a new five-year memorandum of agreement for FY19 to FY23 to continue to provide the GRAD program established in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2419)|
| 0:40:32| 20 years ago this year, with annual updates to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| GRAD is a K-16 college and career access and success education program working elementary through post-secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2438)|

| 0:41:41| The district benefits from the K-16 GRAD approach, but the new five-year MOA specifically restricts district funding to high school expenses only at an amount of $700,000 annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2501)|
| 0:41:54| and we honor that designated restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2514)|

| 0:43:35| We already had shared back-office functions since 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2615)|

| 0:45:49| However, the state report card percentage includes only those who self-report use of public assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2749)|

| 0:47:26| and the MOA target there is assist KCS in increasing the graduation rates at each school by 1.5% each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2846)|
| 0:47:36| The blue bars indicate the goals, and the orange bars indicate the outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| At far right, the goals and outcomes are provided in table form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| and the shaded box on the right indicates the number of students reported as the high school's cohort and the number of graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| Again, definition of terms are provided in the Calculating Metrics document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| and the state defines the cohort as the number of students who started at the school in ninth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| The district's graduation rate is shown in green above the bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| For year two, the metric one AE goal was 78.8%, and the outcome was 78.2%, again reflected in the second set of bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2890)|
| 0:48:22| And the same metric for Fulton, with the same target adjusted to their specific graduation rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| The metric one goal for Fulton was 74.5%, and the outcome was 80.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| Again, the second set of bars reflects that comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| Metric two reflects the post-secondary enrollment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| and you'll note on this metric it reports prior year, as grad scholars have up to one year to enroll in post-secondary and activate their scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2926)|
| 0:48:56| Project GRAD will work with KCS to increase the post-secondary enrollment rate of graduates at Austin East and Fulton high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| according to the KCS National Clearinghouse data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| and verified accredited non-clearinghouse institutions like Berea College, TCAT, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2948)|
| 0:49:18| The clearinghouse is a fee-based membership, and not all accredited institutions pay to join it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| So when grad scholarship recipients enroll in an accredited institution that's not a member of the clearinghouse, we report those enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| And again, examples there are TCAT, Knoxville, and Berea College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| The AE goal for year two was 41.1%, and the outcome was 49.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| And again, tables provided to the right indicate those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| And for Fulton, the same metric, the goal was 50.6%, and the outcome was 50.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| Again, the second set of bars indicates that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| The third metric combines the number of AE and Fulton graduating seniors who qualify for the grad scholarship as one cohort for the graduating year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3007)|
| 0:50:18| Project GRAD will increase the number of seniors that qualify as a grad scholarship recipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| The target is increase the proportion of senior cohort members that are PGK scholarship recipients by 4.5% each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3024)|
| 0:50:36| The GRAD class cohort is tracked beyond high school by the GRAD college and career success coaching that is provided outside of the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3036)|
| 0:50:46| But the year two goal was 37.8%, and the outcome was 45%, with 147 recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3046)|
| 0:50:58| We've added a COVID-related data note to the year two update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| Approximately 48 days were lost when the 2019-20 school year ended on March 12, approximately a fourth of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3064)|
| 0:51:14| However, not all days lost were significant to data outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| It is suspected, however, that the real impact from school disruptions due to COVID will be most evident during the current 2021 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3078)|
| 0:51:28| With that consideration, the following suggestion is made for assessing 2021 school year and COVID impact if there is a related district decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3088)|
| 0:51:39| For example, the KCS district rate for 2020 is 91%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| If the KCS graduation rate for 21 were to decline by 3%, the GRAD metrics would be adjusted down by 3% as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3104)|
| 0:51:54| Metric 1 references that GRAD provide intentional supports that align with school-based initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3114)|

| 0:55:56| And Madam Chair, that concludes my update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you, Ms. Chandler. Do we have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| Mr. Watson. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Ronnie, in full disclosure, you know, you and I get the chance of working together with the organization that I run with the Strong Women, Strong Futures campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| And I just want to thank you for being such a tremendous advocate for education and for our young people and the passion that you and your team display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| One is you all, with the help of Knox County Schools, because it's a team effort, knocked out a lot of your metrics, knocked it out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3383)|
| 0:56:31| But there was some decline in graduation rates between 18 and 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| Do you have any sense of what's behind that decline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| And I know it's not just up to Project Grad. I know there's a ton of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| So as we are looking at what is impacting both of our high schools are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| So before answering that, I probably would want to hear from the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| Okay. And then the last question that I have is, and I think I know the answer to this, but I'm just not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| Is there anything that's fundamentally shifted with Project Grad's work with the start of Knox Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| No. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Okay. I have one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| I have a couple of people that are connected with Tennessee Promise that are concerned about the percentage of students across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| who are filling out the FAFSA because the deadline is February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| And I know AE and Fulton are way down last year to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| Is that something that Project Grad assists with with FAFSA or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Actually, yes. And I'm pretty sure our numbers of all eligible students who are eligible to apply for Tennessee Promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| are actually up at one of the schools for Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| This is Tanisha Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| In assessing those numbers, often they look at entire student body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| And so what we try to do is frame those numbers within those that are actually eligible to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| And so if you look, there was a shift, though, this year with more of a concentrated effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| where they actually virtual and in person contacted each family, each student, and the numbers are much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| But again, we have a good population of students that aren't eligible to apply for FAFSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| And so we have to separate those numbers really to get an accurate assessment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| Okay. So any student that is going to post-secondary would need to fill out the FAFSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| So what would be that requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| So, for instance, our undocumented students, some of our refugee students, they're not able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| And we have a growing population in Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Okay. And now I would like to introduce our Assistant Superintendent and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ron McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| He will go over the general purpose financial position and bring us up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| So, as you know, we're keeping a close eye on sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| That's a big driver for our revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| We did get our fourth data point in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Keep in mind that sales tax for two months in arrears, so this fourth data point means October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| And I'm pleased to say that it continues to be positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| So when we ran the numbers, we look at trend information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| We are projecting an annual surplus of $22.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| Again, there's a lot of the year left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| And if you remember last month when I addressed this, this debt was through three data points through September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| Our annual projection at that point in surplus was $22.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| And though the news had been positive all along, there was, you know, we wanted to be really cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| because the surplus had decreased each month, our forecasted surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| But then in October, a little bit of an uptick, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| So we're holding steady through a third of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| I will say this, though, that economists across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| and the data that they're looking at suggests that November and December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| may not be quite as positive as they had hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| It doesn't mean it's bad, just maybe not as good as initially hoped for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| Now what does that mean for our community? We really don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| because we don't necessarily correlate to national trends here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| We will have the November numbers in a couple of weeks, and so that will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| I can tell you, though, that the good news for us, as I've stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| is we budgeted very conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| We are running right now at a 15% surplus over budget on the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3664)|
| 1:01:12| And we're actually running about 7.5% more in actual collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| as compared to this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| So as you know, this time last year, COVID was not really on the radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| especially with respect to economic trends and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| So we're trending pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| I do think the revenue picture will become much more clear in about 10 to 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| And the reason for that is by then we will have the holiday spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| November and especially December, we will have those data points in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| that we can look at because those are pretty significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| with regards to the proportion of total revenue on the sales tax side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| We will also have December and February postings for property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| And the reason that's important is about 70% of our total property tax collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| are received in December and February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| And so right now, up until this point, we still don't really have enough data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| under our belt to make any meaningful forecasts for property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| By then we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| And property tax accounts for about 20% of our revenue budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| So that's a significant revenue stream as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| But what we know now, based on the information we have in our postings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| we're still holding steady, holding pretty good with regards to revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| I will say this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Regardless of how much or how fortunate we are on the level of surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| we will close into this year's budget, we need every penny of that and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| because, as Mr. Thomas has already mentioned, for this year alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| we suspect or we are anticipating spending about $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| unbudgeted costs related to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Primarily that relates to our virtual learning initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| and personal protective equipment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| And so also I think we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Hopefully we can cover that through surplus collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| But we'll also need considerable amount of reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| going into the next budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Because how much, to what extent will COVID still be around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| and to what extent will those be the need for the dollars to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3814)|
| 1:03:42| I don't think virtual learning is going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| As Mr. Thomas has said, this pandemic has created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| a whole new structural delivery models for dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| So I think the question is, to what degree will that continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| Also, Mr. Thomas mentioned the one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| As you're aware, we funded the bulk of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| as we roll that out through CARES dollars, federal grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| We are keeping a close eye on what this new wave of money will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| We're trying to chase down information right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| Hopefully within the next couple of weeks that will be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| I think the states have to get their arms around what it means for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| And then once that happens, then they have to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| what it means for the districts in that state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| because the money flows through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| So we're keeping our fingers crossed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| I won't even try to speculate on what that will look like at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Although it does appear help is on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| That will provide great relief to not only this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| hopefully next year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| But we need to find a way at some point for this one-to-one initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| to work that into the budget because that's a recurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| We're looking at $5 million to $7 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| So at some point we'll have to work that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Also compensation enhancements for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| We're going to take a hard look at that like we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| That's usually one of the first priorities that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| and we were unable to give those for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| Other than step increases, we were unable to give percentage salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| We're also looking at health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| and there are significantly more participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| on the health insurance plan than in the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| Right now, just that cost alone could reach as much as $2 million more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| than what we spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| So we'll have to budget for that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| We also, as you recall, we had some reductions in our base budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| going into this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| The first thing that always comes to my mind are school allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| We reduced those by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And some schools are struggling right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| because they also had a reduction in football ticket sales, Yates sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| And so it's likely we're going to have to, for some schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| we're taking a look at how much do we need to assist them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| for the remainder of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| But particularly, we need to look hard at restoring those cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| back up to the levels that they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And then also textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| That's always one that's kind of a high-dollar item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| We did not even purchase the ELA adoption for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| For the upcoming year, I believe it's math coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| For the last couple of years, to fully implement that adoption cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| you're looking at $7, $8, $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| We have been able in the past, for the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| been able to cover some of those costs through fund balance dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Hopefully these surplus, if we continue the trend in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| for the remainder of the year, the surplus dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| if they're there, those will obviously close into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| That would help greatly with the textbooks initiative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| We also had a host of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| I won't go over all of those, but there were a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| A host of needs that were requested in this current budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| we were seriously looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| When COVID hit, we just started rolling things off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| And the things that always jumped out in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| I won't go over all of them, but included in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| were increases to intervention supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| We do have intervention supports. We need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Especially in light of what we've gone through this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| I suspect that we'll need that even more than we did the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| So we need to look hard at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Same thing with mental health supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| We were looking to bolster the resources for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| and I think we need to take a hard look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| So, you know, again, this new stimulus package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| we're very hopeful that that could help mitigate some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| You know, with the new presidential administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| will there be another stimulus bill come through? Don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| But, you know, that's something we can hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| But anyway, we're operating still with a lot of unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| But as we go more and more into the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| some of this begins to take a little bit more focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| not only with regards to revenue, but expenditures as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| So I would just say, again, we remain cautiously optimistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| but we know that this upcoming budget will be challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| like every other budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| I've never known, I've never seen a budget yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| where the needs didn't exceed the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| So whatever surplus dollars we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| we need to use those wisely and very strategically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| And so that's, anyway, that's budget status right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| I'm going to, in a nutshell, be happy to take any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Oh, Betsy, yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| So thank you, Madam Chair and Mr. McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| thank you for that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| I know that the governor and the legislative leaders have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| that they want to hold the schools, the school districts harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| And I believe I've heard you say that there's more than one way to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| and some ways are more helpful than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| So I was wondering if we could get maybe a one-pager that explains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| what we need our legislators to do to hold us harmless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| in a way that would be most helpful in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Would that be a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Yes, that's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Yes, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Yeah, so hold harmless can mean a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| And other boards across the state have had resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| in their priorities asking to be held harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| I think I've actually seen some boards say, very specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| don't give us any less money than you did the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| We don't want to settle for that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| And that's why we want to tie it back more so to Average W membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| because that's a primary component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And so we tie it to Average W membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| What we're really saying is hold us harmless with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| because that's the primary driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| And if we were held harmless in the sense that we received just level funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| that would be very hard on us as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| because typically just with natural growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| we could receive $7 million, $8 million a year on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Not only that, coupled with the fact that if we're not held harmless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| as Mr. Thomas said, that could be $8 million or more going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| So yeah, there's a lot of repercussions from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| So if you'd like, yes, we can, if that's what you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| maybe just kind of a little bullet point on the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| And I just have one other thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| I appreciate you bringing up that teacher pay is a top priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| and I believe that our teachers and staff have been doing an amazing job this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| to ensure that our children are safe and they're learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I know that the budget is still in flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| I completely understand that, but I believe I just want to reconfirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| and we all need to reconfirm that our commitment to increase our salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| and just make that a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| I know there's lots of other programs that we want to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| but I think teacher pay is a top priority, so it doesn't continue to fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| And I know that we had discussed a bonus, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| but I think that's a one-time payment that won't be factored into their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| I don't think it'll help us recruit and retain teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| I just think that we need – we're the last in the major counties in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| and we're behind neighboring districts in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| and I just want it to do well by our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| I just wanted to reiterate that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Ron, I'm not sure that you're the one to answer this, but if not, just say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4334)|
| 1:12:26| There's been a lot of talk about the virtual and about, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4346)|
| 1:12:35| I'm not placing any blame on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| I'm sure that in some places teachers have done amazing work with what they have had to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4359)|
| 1:12:50| But if the kids do not sign on for the period and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4370)|
| 1:12:58| so where I'm going is if we have a lot of kids that are failing or are behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4378)|
| 1:13:08| would we probably do that as a separate session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4388)|
| 1:13:19| or would we just work that into the regular calendar year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4399)|
| 1:13:27| Do you mean with regards to interventions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I may need to turn to John on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| Dr. Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| So I think a couple things I've heard Mr. Thomas say, and I think Ron said too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| that virtual is probably here to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| So I'll try to answer that two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| I'll try to answer what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| which seems more like a learning loss or a make-up time kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| maybe like a virtual summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| I'm just thinking those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| What we're hearing is that there's potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| the funds that Ron has mentioned that were this next batch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| that that is one of the buckets that could potentially be fundable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| that it could be like a learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| So they're not saying specifically summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| We don't know what all that means yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| We know it's been identified as one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| and I think Mr. Trent and Ms. Thompson both have already started thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| through what could that look like and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| So I think one of the answers to the question is, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I think there could be some potential additional time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| not in the traditional school year that we would have for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| But when Mr. Thomas and Mr. McPherson speak to kind of virtual is here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| stay, I think here's where the pandemic has kind of forced us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| which has been in some ways great because it's made us have to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| quickly. And to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| we've had some teachers do some incredible things and make exponential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| growth. And what we've seen is some kids really take to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| But we also know, as we said early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| that we've been doing in-person for 100 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| and we've been doing this for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| And I think we're learning a lot of lessons every day through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| So I think where we would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| that we don't know that it's for everybody all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| but we think that what we're trying to do through our research team right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| now is trying to create kind of a profile of virtual learner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| who's being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| And we also know this, that as we learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| we want to get better at virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| So just because it may be for a certain demographic right now or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| certain student or a certain age level student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| that doesn't mean we don't need to continue to grow virtually to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| other students as well. But I think that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| there will be a time where there's probably a little more like a transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| if you're going to transfer to a magnet school or a magnet program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| something like that, where you're looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| and there'll probably be some prerequisites that you've been able to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| that you could have success in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| But right now in the middle of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| that's a little harder to be able to limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| So I think, but again, I think we're learning a lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| And we'll probably will be for the next two or three years as we kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| The governor and the legislature are aware that this exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4564)|
| 1:16:14| The virtual programming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Right. I mean, that there's a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| with some kids not being up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| I read something somewhere the other day or heard something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| I can't remember what it was, but about that there, there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| there was talk because it was so many of them that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| that were behind that, you know, I'm sure they'll have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| I talked to Dave Wright today and we got interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| His wife called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| So we didn't, we didn't conclude our conversation or we did conclude it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| quickly, but we're going to talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| But we were talking specifically about what they're going to do next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| over there, what he anticipates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| And surely if they did come with some kind of a mini summer school or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4626)|
| 1:17:17| something, they would send the money, would you not think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| Again, you know, as Ron said, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| we're just getting the beginnings of hearing what that could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| be, but what we've heard is that it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| that could be one of the ways is one of the categories that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| that this money could be used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| because there's always kind of restrictions to what it's for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| but could be to try to mitigate some of the learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| And so they, they haven't, we don't know exactly what that means, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| our thinking is that we need to be moving toward opportunities outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| just the school year. You know, again, it's not mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| but it's one of the situations where you can make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| You know, the other part of that, Mr. McMillan is, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| I don't know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| anyone who says we know the full impact of what this has been is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| guessing, or they might have small sample data at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| So the other thing we know is, you know, kids are pretty, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| they learn quick, they modify quick and they adapt quick too. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| we won't, we won't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| and we'll have to probably continue to progress monitor this for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| couple of years to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| kids may actually be doing better than we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| and they could be doing worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| And we just kind of look through those to see what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| The good thing is everybody's going through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| So it's not, you know, unique to us. So, you know, so we'll work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| But I guess this would, I agree with everything you said there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| but I guess this would just be conjecture on your part to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| But whenever we work our way through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| you do not anticipate us having near the number that we presently have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4732)|
| 1:19:02| virtual, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Well, I mean, I think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| I don't think any of us predicted we'd have the number we did, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| on a regular year that a third of the population would have chosen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| So, no, I would say I wouldn't anticipate that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| But I will say this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| There are other large districts that have had prior to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| they've had a virtual program or a virtual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| and we've had that at a smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| So I think, you know, this causes us to expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| There are a lot of other places besides just a student being fully on virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| that we think there are places where that could help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| homebound students, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| potentially having access to more classes, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| So I think we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| we're beginning to see where it makes sense and where it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| And, you know, we've had some folks say this has been a great thing for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| and their family too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| So, again, I think as we continue to learn that, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| But, yeah, I wouldn't expect it to stay a third of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Well, that's, I wouldn't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| I'm sure it's been a learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| But I would, once we work our way through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| and we will one way or another eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I would hope that we'll see more and more kids going back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Parents want them to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| They want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Because I just think that even if they do well with virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| I think they miss out on a lot of, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I enjoyed particularly my high school years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| I really enjoyed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| And, you know, I just think if I'd had to experience something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| you know, I lived in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| I didn't see all that many people that lived around me that were my age, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| So, anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Thank you, Dr. Reisbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| We'll move into discussion on our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Thank you all for all those presentations and great information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| So we will move to items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| Do we have questions on one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| Five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| Or seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Any questions on the board policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| The grant that is listed as A was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| But if I'm not mistaken, we are getting additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| and that will come back to us before us in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Is that correct, Mr. Superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| So that will be before us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Any questions on any of the other grants, B, C, or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| And then we're moving into contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Any questions on that contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| And then regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Do we have questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4932)|
| 1:22:22| Ms. Henderson, did you have a question on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| No, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| Ms. Owen, you may be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| Are we receiving information from class weekly regarding the articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| or data, that kind of information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| Anytime the legislature is in session, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| We usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| And they give us other things, additional things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| whenever something comes up, whenever they see that something may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| We do get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| But when they're not in session, there's not really anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| They would just be guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| As soon as the legislature begins session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| there will be a deadline when all of the bills have to be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| And there will be hundreds and hundreds of bills filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| I think during the last session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| there were well over 300 bills just related to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| So they have to sift through everything and pull those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| And as soon as those bills are filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| they will start giving us reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| and then I'll start forwarding them on to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| I just wanted to ask one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| and probably this is maybe of you, Ms. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| because with the special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| which is obviously so concentrated on education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| do we think class will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| I'm just wondering how we can kind of stay up to date with what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Do you think class will be keeping us up on things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| They are always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Anytime I have been in Nashville, they are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| And they work with other folks who are there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| and they sort of divide and conquer because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| there are multiple meetings going on at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| so they make sure that someone is covering all of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| and they're covering them in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| and they're talking to legislators all day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| I just think that special session is going to be so critical to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| and since basically the whole thing is about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| As soon as they know, they'll let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| And you're still having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| you continue even while they're not in session to have the weekly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| meetings, the weekly calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Earlier in the fall, we didn't, but it starts now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| We had a bit of a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| Sort of as needed, but now they will be weekly, weekly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Anything else on this class contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| We will move to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Owen's agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| I will just take a really short second on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| I just want to make sure everybody understands why I'm giving you this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| data apparently for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| We've gotten a lot of emails with a lot of information from a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| different people, and it all seems to be conflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| And looking at it and sifting through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| I keep going back to the state data download.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| And the state data download is very useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| but it's also very, very cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| I went right at the beginning of this meeting to double check some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| numbers, and it's so cumbersome that I couldn't actually check it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| because I couldn't get the whole thing to download.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| If I look at just the COVID data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| there are 20 columns of it and thousands and thousands of lines because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| they have a line of data every day for every county in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| So sorting through that is just crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| So what I've been doing is going through and just sorting the columns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| and then taking out Knox County and dropping it in another spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| just so I can understand what it actually says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Well, then you get into this thing of the 20 columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| and some of them are somewhat duplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| So I wanted to find a way that we could have the information without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| trying to figure out which information is correct every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| So I went through and pulled out the main things that people have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| talking to us about, and I just kept those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| And as I looked at it, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| I don't know if this will even make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| And so I sent it to Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| who was very kind to look at it and tell me whether it made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| And he saw some better ways to show it than just putting it in a spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| and so put it into a chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| So this is just raw from the state data for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| a couple of different ways to look at it so that we know that we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| same thing the state has on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| I guess that's probably all you need to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| It's just there if you need it, if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| If there's some other way that would be easier to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| I would be glad to pull that out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| I'm not the chart master, though, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| So I appreciate that Mr. Watson was willing to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| and help me out with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| But there's no purpose in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| I'm not trying to show anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| It's just the data so that everybody can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Okay, Ms. Fab will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| We have one person on public forum, Ms. Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5285)|
| 1:28:24| Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| Yes, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| I'm doing two things at one time, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| So I was going to get up here and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| But Mr. Watson must have been thinking we had some emoji going on, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| when he asked the question earlier about a rationale from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| schools while we went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| But then as I thought about this before I came up here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| I want you all to know that we are never at odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| Educators are going to do whatever it takes to help educate our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| I think sometimes people think if our jobs were any easier that we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| paid for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| But I want people that are at home to know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| that we don't take our jobs lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| It is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| I, too, Mr. Watson, along with the Knox County Education Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| and every educator in Knox County, don't want to be in the shoes of Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| It is a hard and difficult decision to do what's right for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| But when it comes to our jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| we think that sometimes actions speak louder than words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| And we feel like we're not appreciated sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| or as if people don't care about what's really going on with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| And I had a different perspective after I, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| contracted COVID and been sick for the last 20 days plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Now I'm up to day 24, so don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| I'm trying to make sure that I'm following the guidelines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| But we never want to be at odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| This virus is attacking us on every different level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| And it's attacking us on public education that you have no control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| You have seen all too well yourself that we need more funding for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5427)|

| 1:30:35| Dr. Reisberg just stood up here and said that other districts have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| the technology and devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| We just came to fruition of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| But now it's time to a point that we're asking that from my own state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| president, saying it's time for legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| it's time for local people to actually understand that all the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| educators do, it's time for a bonus and a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| I know that we have challenges with our funding here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| but teachers are working tirelessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| We have done our job from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| We weren't ready back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| We can agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| We were not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| We didn't have the tools ready to help our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| But we agreed to use the $7 million to get one-to-one for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| We used the $7 million to get educators that did not have laptops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| in our own classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| And I think I shocked Mr. Thomas when I told him that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| that we have educators that don't have laptops in our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| But some things are out of your control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| And we just ask for your grace and mercy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| because this virus is causing us to pit each other against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| And there's no way that we should be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| We should be trying to lift each other up and figuring out how can we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| what's best for all educators in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| I just ask you that when I made that statement about us being remotely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| when I thought about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| I also said that it's incumbent on parents to do their job at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| ask us to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| You employ Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| but he can't do his job if he doesn't have the support from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| I said if parents cannot guarantee that they did not go visit Granny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| they didn't go to the beach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| or one of the two million people didn't get on an airplane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| they can't guarantee that they didn't do what was asked of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| And so this is causing anxiety, angst, and frustration from educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| and they can't do their job without the support and earnest knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| you support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| I just heard what Ms. Henderson just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| that teachers need to have due diligence of making sure that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| That's all we're asking is sometimes just say thank you for doing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| you're doing, instead of penalizing us for what we're not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| And again, Mr. Thomas, I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| I can't do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| I don't want your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| And I'm sure that your administration is praying that you stay in your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| And thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Thank you, Ms. Coates, for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you, Ms. Babs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Do we have any comments for board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Go ahead, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| I was getting some feedback earlier that the livestream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| and the cable feed had cut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| So a couple people missed Mr. Watson's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| and some of the explanation by Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| So can we get back to that a little bit so that more of the community can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| hear about why we are back in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I'm sure you'd love to go through that again, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| It's a fun part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Who's over technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| I guess they're going to lose me asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| I appreciate the opportunity to try to repeat myself as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| Going back to why we made the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| I think I talked a little bit about looking at the metrics that we have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| place to help us make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| And some of those metrics were not available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| The student attendance rate, obviously we weren't in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Bus driver attendance rate, again, not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| We weren't in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Cafeteria workers rate, not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Substitute bill rate, again, not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| So some of the metrics weren't available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| However, one metric that was available that we looked at and monitored over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| the break was our teacher and school-based staff attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| And I know Mr. Bolton monitored that for us over the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| And as he was monitoring that, the trend seemed to be that from an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| attendance standpoint for our teachers and school-based support folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| that the attendance rate did not look like it was going to be a problem for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| us, which, again, when we dismissed school, let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| When we went to virtual learning, we were having operational issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| staff attendance as well as a substitute bill rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| But as we were looking at that, the rate, the way it was coming in was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| around 95%, 96% of attendance coming back on the first day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| So we did look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| And, of course, the more people that are in support staff and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| that are in school, the fewer substitutes we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| So that was one of the driving forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| Another driving force was looking at the seven-day average of new cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| when we, the week that we didn't have school in person and went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| virtual, I think maybe during that week, the new cases, I think it went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| up over maybe 500, 400, 500 new cases a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| That seven-day average was right at 400 and something, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| And as we monitored that over the holidays, I think it maybe peaked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| around Christmas time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| So in looking at that, it continued to decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| I think right now it's about 34% less than it was during the week that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| went to virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| So, again, the seven-day rolling average did go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| It's still high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| I think what we'd rather see is, and Ron helped me with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| a number of around 122, 123 in terms of a seven-day average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| But it's right now at 200 plus, 284.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| But it's still less than what it was during that week we were virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| And it seemed like there was something else that I talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| I'm not real good at remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| I know there was another factor that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| And maybe I'll think of it in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| But also we made, in terms of looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| we wanted to be able to safely open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| So certainly the things that we've done all fall semester that allowed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| to have school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| By the way, we had 70 days as a district, 70 days of in-person learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| out of 75 days fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| And I think what helped us to achieve that was following the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| protocols, wearing the masks, disinfecting, hand-washing, staying home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| if you're sick, physically distancing, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| So in terms of coming back, wanted to make sure that we continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| to follow the safety protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Also, I think I talked a little bit about a vaccine that's not available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| for educators and staff yet, but hopefully soon to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| and maybe in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Mr. Thomas, Terry reminded me of your other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| What was it, Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I thought about it a minute ago, but I forgot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| It was just that you had committed to a promise to our 35,000-plus families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| 45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| 45,000-plus families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| You promised that we would try to keep school open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| We made a commitment to the parents of 45,000 of our students that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| would provide an opportunity for in-person learning, provided that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| felt like we could safely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| So those were, I think, the primary considerations and things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| Obviously, again, I think I said this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Maybe I've said it just now, but the fewer substitutes you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| the less problem we would have with the fill rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Our fill rate today was 67%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Anything less than 70% puts us in the red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| But that 67% was higher than it has been since October 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| which is a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| Now, again, all this may turn a different direction in the next day or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| the next week or whatever, and we'll continue to look at school-by-school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| And over the last couple of days, we've looked at school-by-school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| situations, and we're faring very well right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| So, again, that's subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| But I think that was about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Maybe the video, when we can go back and look at the video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| we can compare, see how my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| And the video will be available on the website immediately after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| meeting, and so hopefully it shouldn't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| It should all be there, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| And next time I'll make notes so I can go back and repeat verbatim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Thank you for going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| Mr. Watson, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Well, Mr. Thomas, I appreciate you saying all that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| I think you did a great job repeating yourself, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| So one of the things I just want the community to know is what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| seen in your leadership to this pandemic is you have been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| consistent in your approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| And I think, if anything, I would hope that the community can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| trust that in those moments in the future, if and when you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| to make that hard call that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| What I'm hearing you say is that in the absence of data, you felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| like you needed to make the move that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| And the only thing that I'm hearing in the community is there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| some that say in the absence of data, we should have erred on more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| And I'm not discussing right now which approach was right or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| but I do want to say that I think we can trust that you will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| consistent in making the hard call when it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| So with the data that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| And one thing we talked about in the absence of some data, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| don't go back, when do you go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| What is the point that you reach that you do go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| You know, I don't know exactly what that would be until you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| back and say, okay, we've tried this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| And, again, I got the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| So you're using teachers as guinea pigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| I'm not using teachers as guinea pigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| If I felt like that we couldn't safely go back and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| numbers didn't reflect that we could do that, I wouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| You know, and I'll put myself as a guinea pig, too, from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| If I'm using people as guinea pigs, then I myself consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| myself as a guinea pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| But that's not what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| We had school safely in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| We had some closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| We may still have some closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| They may be one at a time, two at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| It could be the whole district in terms of virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Don't have the crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| But certainly we're going to continue to do what we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| is in the best interest of our students and our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| And I've said, too, you know, we're in this for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| And I know teachers have sacrificed and administrators have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| sacrificed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| And you shouldn't ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| I've got my soap box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Our teachers and administrators have absolutely done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| phenomenal, a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| And if we could afford to pay them double what they make right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| now, that's what they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| So I appreciate Ms. Henderson, too, keeping it on the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| in terms of compensation and salary increases because our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| teachers, and I was out in a couple of schools yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| teachers are just going, they're going above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| And they have done this all semester, the call of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| So kudos to our teachers and to our administrators for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| excellent job that they're doing and continue to do and agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| with everything Ms. Coates said and, you know, in terms of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| hard our teachers and administrators have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| And I do, I know you all appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| And I do appreciate it very much, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| And we don't say it enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| And I know you can't, appreciation doesn't help buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| groceries or pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| But I do just appreciate what all of our folks are doing, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| beyond teachers and administrators, our custodial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| staff, our maintenance staff, our school resource officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| our teacher assistants, our secretaries, cafeteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| everybody is just doing a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| And that's why, too, part of what I wanted to do, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| superintendent's report is that, you know, and said this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| yesterday, hey, we need to forget politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| This is not about politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| This is about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| It's about doing what's best for the students of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| And hopefully, hopefully, then when this legislature meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| they can unite and be on the same page and do what's right by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| the students in the state of Tennessee, all public schools in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Tennessee, not just Knox County, but across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| So I will let you adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| And I think Mr. Watson makes a good point that you have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| consistent in your thought process, and I think it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| prudent to look at closing schools on an as-needed basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| I looked back at the latest data that I saw by school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| We had many schools that had zero staff and other multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| schools, multiple, that had zero cases for students during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| So I hope that that's reassuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6289)|

| 1:44:57| And I think that is a testament to our staff and how well they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| are doing what you've asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| So I agree and thank our staff tremendously for all the hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| work, every teacher, every person that works in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| They've gone above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| So we appreciate that immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| I know everybody wants to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| But you asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| First of all, I think you did an excellent job the way you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| handled it in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| When one school would pop up or two, you would, you know, close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| that for maybe a day or work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| Some modified way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| It seemed to work pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| And you asked the question, if you don't go back, when do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| According to Dr. Fauci or whatever the guy's name is, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| heard that he was predicting we might not be able to get out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| it before fall, even with the vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| Obviously, we hope he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| But the one thing I did want to say, and I still believe this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| is most reasonable people believe the studies that show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6381)|
| 1:46:30| that kids learn better when they're in person, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| socialization process, the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| You know, they're just much better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| Now, could there be some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Yeah, maybe so if that's what their parents want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| But we're not going to be able to satisfy everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| And we did promise, as you said, to have schools open, keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6412)|
| 1:47:00| them open for as many people as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| And that's exactly what we need to do, if at all possible, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6429)|

| 1:47:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| I think that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210106?start=6434)|
