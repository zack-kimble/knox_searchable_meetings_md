| 5:06:28| that we thought that we might need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18388)|
| 5:06:31| instead of a 15% maximum overall grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18391)|
| 5:06:36| is we might have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18396)|
| 5:06:37| or we were going to ask for a maximum of 17% instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18397)|
| 5:06:43| But just reviewing the initial grade plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18403)|
| 5:06:46| that we've come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18406)|
| 5:06:47| we've hit a 15.8, which is just 0.8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18407)|
| 5:06:50| over, you know, the allowable maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18410)|
| 5:06:56| So when you say a 15% grade difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18416)|
| 5:06:59| is that front to back, sideways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18419)|
| 5:07:02| No, that's going downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18422)|
| 5:07:05| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18425)|
| 5:07:06| But which way is downhill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18426)|
| 5:07:07| I can't tell from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18427)|
| 5:07:08| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18428)|
| 5:07:09| Well, Richmond Avenue basically sits at the top of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18429)|
| 5:07:12| I don't know what you call that little range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18432)|
| 5:07:14| of hills up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18434)|
| 5:07:16| But anyway, sort of Richmond Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18436)|
| 5:07:17| sits at sort of the top of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18437)|
| 5:07:20| And so as you're looking down into the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18440)|
| 5:07:23| that all goes downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18443)|
| 5:07:26| Okay, so from the front property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18446)|
| 5:07:29| to the back property line is about 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18449)|
| 5:07:32| Well, it depends on where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18452)|
| 5:07:34| If you can-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18454)|
| 5:07:34| Oh, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18454)|
| 5:07:35| At least I get an idea of existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18455)|
| 5:07:37| Yeah, you see the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18457)|
| 5:07:38| so the redder areas are the more steep areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18458)|
| 5:07:42| And then the green and yellow are the less steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18462)|
| 5:07:45| And so what we've done is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18465)|
| 5:07:47| we've concentrated the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18467)|
| 5:07:49| strictly in the yellow and greenish areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18469)|
| 5:07:52| We're trying to avoid the red areas altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18472)|
| 5:07:55| I like everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18475)|
| 5:07:56| I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18476)|
| 5:07:57| can you gain more flexibility in your grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18477)|
| 5:08:02| if in your housing you did duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18482)|
| 5:08:05| or a little more clustering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18485)|
| 5:08:08| I think that would kill the character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18488)|
| 5:08:09| just to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18489)|
| 5:08:11| Yeah, I want to do single family detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18491)|
| 5:08:15| If you start going to duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18495)|
| 5:08:16| then it just puts you in a different category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18496)|
| 5:08:18| And that's just not what I want to try to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18498)|
| 5:08:21| with this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18501)|
| 5:08:22| And your market's different too, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18502)|
| 5:08:25| Yeah, and as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18505)|
| 5:08:26| I just don't necessarily want people buying these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18506)|
| 5:08:30| to be able to lease them or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18510)|
| 5:08:32| I think if you're going to start doing duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18512)|
| 5:08:35| then you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18515)|
| 5:08:36| One, it's harder to set up legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18516)|
| 5:08:38| So yeah, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18518)|
| 5:08:39| That's going to be a typical look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18519)|
| 5:08:42| of what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18522)|
| 5:08:44| And so trying to incorporate that architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18524)|
| 5:08:47| into duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18527)|
| 5:08:48| I just don't think it would look very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18528)|
| 5:08:51| And it would just kill the aesthetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18531)|
| 5:08:53| of the whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18533)|
| 5:08:54| Love those big front porches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18534)|
| 5:08:57| Yeah, and I think it'll be so cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18537)|
| 5:08:59| because I've got a development up in Sevierville right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18539)|
| 5:09:03| and we've done front porch swings on all of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18543)|
| 5:09:06| And those people, I mean, they just absolutely love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18546)|
| 5:09:09| They'll sit out there in the afternoons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18549)|
| 5:09:12| and chit chat with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18552)|
| 5:09:13| And it's just a really cool element to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18553)|
| 5:09:16| And it really helps people get to know their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18556)|
| 5:09:20| and develop a sense of community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18560)|
| 5:09:22| which is what we're really trying to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18562)|
| 5:09:23| in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18563)|
| 5:09:25| Great. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18565)|
| 5:09:27| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18567)|
| 5:09:27| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18567)|
| 5:09:30| Yes, Mr. Fortune, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18570)|
| 5:09:33| We're very refreshing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18573)|
| 5:09:35| This is kind of what we always want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18575)|
| 5:09:40| It's not always what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18580)|
| 5:09:41| but I appreciate you hanging in to the end of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18581)|
| 5:09:45| and I appreciate all the work y'all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18585)|
| 5:09:48| To be my last comment on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18588)|
| 5:09:50| job well done, Mr. Fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18590)|
| 5:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18592)|
| 5:09:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18592)|
| 5:09:55| Well, it lasts for at least a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18595)|
| 5:09:58| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18598)|
| 5:10:01| I can well imagine that you will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18601)|
| 5:10:06| I think that that brings us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18606)|
| 5:10:07| I don't see any other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18607)|
| 5:10:10| I think that brings us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18610)|
| 5:10:13| We have a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18613)|
| 5:10:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18619)|
| 5:10:19| So we do have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18619)|
| 5:10:21| It's probably going to only take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18621)|
| 5:10:22| about another hour and a half to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18622)|
| 5:10:25| Let me bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18625)|
| 5:10:31| I don't see, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18631)|
| 5:10:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18635)|
| 5:10:36| File number is 3C20SU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18636)|
| 5:10:40| Filing Christine Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18640)|
| 5:10:43| It's a matter of the type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18643)|
| 5:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18646)|
| 5:10:46| In March of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18646)|
| 5:10:49| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18649)|
| 5:10:50| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18650)|
| 5:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18650)|
| 5:10:51| One item that was not in our chair package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18651)|
| 5:10:56| is we have one tabled item that we need to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18656)|
| 5:11:01| to untable to be heard under agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18661)|
| 5:11:06| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18666)|
| 5:11:08| We just need to vote on untabling this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18668)|
| 5:11:11| And it is tabled item number one, Christine Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18671)|
| 5:11:17| Art, would you like to make the last motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18677)|
| 5:11:21| Motion to untable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18681)|
| 5:11:24| We saved this just for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18684)|
| 5:11:27| Motion to untable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18687)|
| 5:11:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18689)|
| 5:11:30| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18690)|
| 5:11:32| a second by Commissioner Buston to untable item number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18692)|
| 5:11:39| tabled item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18699)|

| 5:13:32| And I hate to see you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18812)|
