| 0:04:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Madam Clerk, would you please read our first presentation item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| which is number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| This is a presentation by Bart McFadden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| President and CEO of Boys and Girls Clubs of the Tennessee Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Welcome, Mr. McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| You will state your name and address, sir, and you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Bart McFadden, 1745 Winrow Circle here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| I just wanted to come tonight and share with this body just some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| great work that our organization is doing here in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| A lot of that support that you guys provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| we are turning into positive outcomes for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| I placed at each of your seats kind of a couple of little documents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| that you can see an overview of the work we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| But more than anything, I just wanted to thank this group for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Our organization has been serving some of the most underserved kids in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| county for nearly 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Next year will be our organization's 80th birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| something we're very excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| And while the work of the club has truly evolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| people tend to think of Boys and Girls Club as still athletics and swimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| pools and gymnasiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| but our work is much different than that now as the needs of kids have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| certainly evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| We seek to promote outcomes in three main areas, as you can see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| academic success, healthy lifestyles, good character, and citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| And we really do that through four main avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| First and foremost, we provide a safe space for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| not only physical safety but emotional safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Ninety-six percent of the kids that we serve in Boys and Girls Club say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| the club is the safest place they spend time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| And that is an incredibly encouraging but a very sobering number that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| should all take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Next, we provide unique opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Many of you would be surprised to know that we provide paid internships for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| over 300 kids in our community in this county last year through our Youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Force program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| which is a program that seeks to instill soft skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| essential skills in our kids to make sure that they're job ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| and then place them in paid internships to help them find out what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| interested in, what they're good at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| and then give them an opportunity to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Next is academic support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| I don't think anybody in here is not aware of the negative impact that COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| had on the academic pursuits of young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| And starting in the summer of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| we dove in with Governor and Chrissy Haslam with the Tennessee Tutoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| which has now kind of evolved into the all-core tutoring program that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| state is providing funding to local districts for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| We started doing that in addition to other things that we provide tutoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| to kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| We outperformed kids in our clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| outperformed Knox County students as a whole last year in reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| and science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| and significantly by about 48 percent in science on state testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| So the work we are doing in our clubs is making an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| And then last but not least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| and probably most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| positive relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| putting adult role models in the lives of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| For all the great programs I've just mentioned here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| I've been in this work for nearly 30 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I've never heard a kid come up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| thank God for such and such program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| That changed my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| The program is simply a conduit for an adult to step into the life of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| child and make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| hold high expectations for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| share opportunities with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| and help lead them to a place where they can reach their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| A couple of things that we are doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| and you see on this card right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| some of the things that we're making a difference in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Child care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| we're all keenly aware of the role that child care or lack thereof is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| playing in our economy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| We're serving over 1,000 kids a day here in Knox County in Boys and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| Girls Clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| well over 5,000 a year with affordable child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| We've taken it a step further this school year with a pilot program to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| provide services to pre-K kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Historically, we've only served kindergarten and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| but this year at Lonsdale Elementary and at South Knox Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| we are serving pre-K kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| That's for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| One, it meets the child care need that many have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| But also, when we learned over this past year that less than a quarter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| our kids going into kindergarten here in Knox County are deemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| kindergarten ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| we've got to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| We know the critical benchmark of third grade reading and how important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Well, how are we going to achieve high percentages of proficient third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| grade readers if we're starting kindergarten ready at a 25% rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| So we're beginning our academic support for pre-K kids this year at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| South Knox and at Lonsdale Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| So great work that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| You can see here a couple of ways that you as our local body can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| support some of the work we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| advocating for dollars at the state level to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| There are plenty of child care dollars available at the state level that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| can be accessed by organizations like ours to provide services to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| And that's been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| So that's something we're working hard for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| We would love to have your support in those advocacy efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| I'm open to any questions that any of you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you, Commissioner McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| And the tour that you offered us was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Would you just please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| one thing I knew nothing about that you were doing was the position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| you offered in our high schools as far as the career guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| which I'm assuming also teams up with this internship role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| So we have a program that is in six Knox County high schools as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| our college and career readiness effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Those high schools are Carnes, West, Central, Powell, Austin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| East and Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| And as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| guidance counselors in Knox County are serving a large numbers of kids per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| counselor, making it really difficult to build those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| So we go into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| these six high schools with full time paid staff to intentionally build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| relationships with about 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| 150 kids at each school targeting low income and potential first generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| college students to provide college and career counseling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| subject specific academic support, college tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| And then that's the net that we cast to reach kids and bring them into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| workforce development program where they do the soft skills training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| the internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| And then in the summer technical training camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| we offered 14 technical training camps this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| which are one week long exploration experiences into a variety of careers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| welding, cybersecurity, criminal justice, nursing, culinary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| cosmetology, just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| But it starts though, as you said, commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| in those high schools with those paid staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| building relationships to bring those kids into those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| I would like to just challenge people to look at their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| And you've heard some of the results that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| And it's fact driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| This isn't just an emotional feel good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| but there are a lot of facts to back up what boys and girls club do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| And if you look at the dollar for dollar that they spend compared to several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| other organizations, pointing no fingers, I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| But you talk about a lot of bang for your buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| The money that Knox County donates to Boys and Girls Club is money well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| To that point, commissioner, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| we had a study completed that showed that for every dollar invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| there was a $12.60 return on that investment in positive economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| outcomes in communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| That could be kids that graduated on time that wouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| statistically speaking, have otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| It's kids that may have avoided engagement with the juvenile justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| And it's also parents that could continue working because they had access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| to affordable child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| And Wes Stowers is with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Wes is our current board chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| a great champion for the work we do with youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| And Wes, if you'd like to add anything, please feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Well, all I would like to add is we have an exceptional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| They live their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| And I want to compliment the city, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| and certainly the Knox County Schools for the cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| We have a lot of resources in terms of buildings and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| And what we can provide is the enrichment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| the staff for the after school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| And the more that we can access the school facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| the more staff we can provide and the more kids we can reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| So thank you all for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Commissioner Jay, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Great job with what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Well, I know this is the tip of the iceberg of so many more programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| that are really geared towards the needs of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| and the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| My wife and I are personal supporters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| but I've seen firsthand some of the results of the confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| that you build in kids, as you said, the safe environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| One of the things I noticed on your sheet was a focus on character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| but good citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| I would encourage you to really look at any and all programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| that you can focus in the area of civics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| We have at least 11 commissioners here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| and I imagine a whole lot more across the board that would be more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| willing to be able to come and help and be supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| We have got to educate our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| but especially our young people, about the importance of getting involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| in your community in a civic level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| And so I would encourage you to add more and more emphasis on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| as the years go on and you develop the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| I will say thank you for saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| and that's something that we certainly want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Commissioner Lundy and I have had that conversation kind of in depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| about how we can help our young people understand what this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| is really about, how you can utilize your voice in a positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| meaningful way, and how we want our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| One of our big objectives is to make sure that our kids are contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| members to this community or whatever community they choose to live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| And so thank you for that and well noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| I just wanted to commend Mr. McFadden and the staff at all of our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Boys and Girls Clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| I have had the opportunity to visit two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| and I would like to also issue a challenge to my colleagues to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| If not one, then you are totally missing out on what this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| and this community is receiving from the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| I was also fortunate to be able to recognize the Youth of the Year this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| year because she attends Central High School, which is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and she is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| And if that is what the Boys and Girls Club produces on a mass level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| then we need to do what we can to support them because all the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| that I have met that have been in the Boys and Girls programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| they are going places and they are our future leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you very much, Mr. McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Thank you, Mr. Stowers, for presenting to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| So, commissioners, at this time we're going to move into the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| segment of our meeting, and we do have a few individuals signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| on Ordinance 104, and I'm just going to call these names as they appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| The first one is Nathan Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Is Mr. Anderson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Come on to the podium, Mr. Anderson, and if you'll state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| and county of residence, you have five minutes to address commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| I'll try to be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| A lot on the docket tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| My name is Nathan Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| I'm from Strawberry Plains, Knox County side of Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| I am with an HVAC company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| We specialize in geothermal heating and cooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I'm also president this year of the Greater Home Builders Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| so we represent Knox County as well as several surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| I'm specifically here tonight on the proposed change to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| As you're all aware, we have a serious housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| not just in Knoxville, really all the surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| and it's a national statewide problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| It's not going away anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| The problem is the prices have gotten very, very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Everyone's aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| We're trying to do everything we can to lower it from the top down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| but there are a lot of things we can do locally to help streamline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| that process and lower the overall cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| There are lots of small things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| There's no magic fix across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| I think this is one of the small things that will actually help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| If we can lower the cost for development and developmental costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| we can help lower the end cost as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| It will be passed on and goes down the food chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| This isn't a change in regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| We're not changing the environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| We're not changing watersheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| We're not changing any of that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| What's been proposed here is simply streamlining the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| I'd be happy to speak with anybody at any point, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| on lots of other small things we can do to help streamline other processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| to help drive down the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I'd greatly appreciate that opportunity in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| For example, the BZA right now is a great group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| They're appointed, as you all are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| They're not always specialists in their particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| As a result, some of the contentious matters that come before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| end up going to the Chancery Court anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Right now they're a middleman that takes some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| two, three, four months to go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| but it slows down a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| That time costs developers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| It costs money, which then gets passed on to the homeowners of the end product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| By streamlining this, it will drive down the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| because we're cutting out the middleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| No one is losing their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| That's what I've heard a number of people complain about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| I know a lot of people who I've had very good conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| that were concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| No rights are being taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| The exact same rights afforded now will be afforded at the end of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| It can ultimately end up in Chancery Court anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| The same appellate process is available to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| Under the current method, it usually ends up in the Chancery Court anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| if it's a contentious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Either the developer or anyone that has the complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| can take it as far as the Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| So by simply allowing it to go directly to the Chancery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| we're really going to speed up a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| If anyone has any questions on any other issues, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| I would love to speak with you in the future about other small things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| but this is one small thing we can change without changing anyone's rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| which is the important thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| We're not changing any regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| We're not changing any rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| We're simply streamlining the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Scott Davis is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Is Mr. Davis here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| I don't believe he's here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| I don't believe Ms. Starbucks is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Next will be Kevin Murphy and then Bob Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1172)|
| 0:19:44| Good evening, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| The slides that I'm looking at start on page three of the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| that Mr. Thompson is giving you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| So last week, Chairman Beeler asked me a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| What do the other large counties do for development plans and appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| That's Hamilton County for Chattanooga, Shelby for Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| and the Metro Nashville governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I didn't know, so we went and looked at the zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| and we also called and emailed them to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| What we found is that they use legislative processes for development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Yeah, slide number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Not an administrative process like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Their plans first go to county or planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| and then they all go to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| So they all have a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Their appeal then is a legislative appeal from county commission to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| We have just one opportunity for public input when you have a development plan in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| That's at planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| The claim last month that we have three opportunities for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| well, that's stretching it because you're counting two rezoning meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| and we've been here a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| There's no development plan in front of you at the rezoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| You're looking at density and the uses at that point, and I've heard it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| That's all you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| and then the public will have an opportunity to look at the detailed plan later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| So the only opportunity for civic engagement in the development plan process in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| is that one hearing at planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| So if you want to actually argue the other side of it, which you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| you can actually say that we are more efficient than our peer counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| because we only require one review, and they require it to go through two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| So we actually have greener tape than our peer counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| And KCPA, we're not advocating that we have a mandatory two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| What else did we find looking at these counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| The Metro Council for Davidson County, when they look at a development plan at Metro Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| it's actually three readings, a first reading, a public hearing, and then a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| So if you take those three plus the reading that they have at planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| there's four opportunities for public input at Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Shelby County actually requires the applicant to hold a neighborhood meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| before it even goes to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| That was a nice insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Hamilton and Shelby counties, when you look at their ordinances around residential development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| they have specific open space requirements in them where they have to have common areas and recreation and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| All three of the counties have more and higher performance standards around landscaping, lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| and other operational standards than we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Which speaks to one of the reasons we see appeals of residential development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| because our development bar is kind of down on the floor, and neighborhoods, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| they have to beg for just the most basic things like parks, sidewalks, and landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| This picture here is of Windermere Trails in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| There's no trees, no sidewalks, just a few plants in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| I mean, not a single tree in that entire subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| The mayor says we need to keep our young people here and attract new businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| but is this the kind of residential development that's going to attract people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| You know, if you're young, probably going to move to Chattanooga or someplace where it looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| you know, where at least the housing they're building looks a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| and the available housing stock is built to some higher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| And I'm guessing this probably isn't what we show any prospective visitors when the Chamber is taking them around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| So that's why the public is so interested in development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| because it's only through civic engagement on a plan-by-plan basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| that we can try to change the mind of a developer who chooses to just do the bare minimum of what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| Final slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| By codifying that appeals go to BZA and are heard de novo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| we're asking you to give us the opportunity for that second round of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| but make that optional, triggered by an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And I'd argue that gives us the best of both worlds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| We have a quicker one-step process, which is the mandatory part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| so it's quicker than compared to our peer counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| but we have that rarely used option to appeal to BZA for a closer look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And that's the rare exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| This chart shows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| There were 110 development plans starting from January 2020 through July of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| Three of them were appealed to the BZA, and all three of them were resolved at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| None of those three since January 2020 went on to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| It's a 2.73% appeal rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| It's about one per calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| and that compares to three and a half development plans per month that are approved at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| So that gives you a little bit of the numbers, and I really appreciate the question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| I thought that was some good insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Mr. Thompson, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| If I may, a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Just for the record, the subdivision, the Windermere subdivision that was shown here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| and this is not addressing 4 against this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| it's interesting to note that this was the first subdivision that was built that is strictly rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| So these homes are not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| It is sort of an apartment complex, as you will, only it's homes instead of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Mr. Thompson, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Bob Thompson, 8136 Jonesboro, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| I've got just a couple quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| As Mr. Murphy pointed out, the appeals rate from Planning Commission is very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| Out of over 100 development plans approved by Planning Commission since January 2020, only three have been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1558)|
| 0:26:06| It's not a high rate of appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| And those three appeals covered only about 160 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| The over 100 development plans approved by Planning Commission involved around 8,000 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| So if you look at the number of appeals compared to the plans approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| if you look at the number of appeals affecting dwelling units, very small, very small percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| And it's really speculative as to whether BZA really affects the timeline for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| There are many other factors that affect whether a plan can proceed even after the plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| There's utility connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| There's wrapping up the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| There's availability of contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| There's other priorities that developers may have, any number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| For example, even now, if you look at the cost of materials for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| like lumber prices have spiked over the past year, up and down and up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| So depending on when the developer wants to lock in or the builder wants to lock in, it may have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| you can't say that two months is going to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| And the same thing is true as to interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| I don't know, you know, not being a developer, I don't know when developers lock in their interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| It may come at different times of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| It may come after the plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| But even in times like now of generally, a generally trend of rising interest rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| you'll see just in the past month rates have gone down, up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| It varies week to week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| So the effect of delay, it's speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| And, again, there's very few dwelling units that are impacted by the appeals that have been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1666)|
| 0:27:56| I've got a couple of other quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| As we've discussed this, several of you have mentioned questions about BZA's functionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| and about the appeals process in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| For example, Dr. Lundy and Mr. J have mentioned, well, what about encouraging people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| encouraging developers and potential opposition to meet early in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and try to work things out to avoid, to reduce the possibility of appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| I think many of you have that same idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I know Mr. Daley encourages developers to come speak in our neighborhood when they're affecting our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| But there are other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| For example, there's been questions about attendance, BZA members' attendance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| There's been questions about the criteria by which BZA must make its decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1726)|
| 0:28:55| So I do want to ask if you have these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| if you might take this opportunity to consider addressing those through a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| For example, the existing zoning ordinance, 6.60.01, says that you may remove a BZA member for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1747)|
| 0:29:17| So one thing you could do, you could tweak that to say, well, cause may include attendance problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| And that's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| I could mention many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| So you could include those in the current ordinance, in the current proposal you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| or you could include them in what we would like to see, which would be to clarify that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| appeals of development plans do go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| You could put them either place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| So that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| My second point is I do suggest that amending the ordinance to clarify, as I just suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| to clarify that appeals do go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| I think that's the most supportable approach, the most likely to avoid lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| You've already heard a lot about the Browning-Ferris opinion, and I won't beat that horse further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Just let me briefly say that, as Mr. Murphy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| as we've learned about how other counties do this, how other counties do it through a legislative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| which is, in fact, much less efficient than how we do it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| in learning how the – in understanding how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| and understanding the difference between the legislative approach to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| and the administrative approach, which we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| and I – in reading court opinions from across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| how the courts attach significance to that difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| that's just convinced me more than ever that the Browning-Ferris opinion was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| in its reading of how administrative decisions, such as we have, are appealed through the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1854)|
| 0:31:04| That's really all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I would mention that the – just a random note, the current ordinance proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| if you look at the whereases, I think those need a bit of cleaning up, not to presume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| but, for example, one of the whereases talks about the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| It was a court of appeals opinion, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I see Ms. Starbuck is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Commissioner Jay, did you have a comment before we call her up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| I have a question for Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| but if you'd rather me wait until we get into the ordinance later on in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I think that might be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Ms. Starbuck, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you very much, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| My name is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Commissioner Beeler is my commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Most everyone is concerned about recent housing trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| that have impacted the availability and affordability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| This is a nationwide issue, not just in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| KCPA shares the concerns about housing shortages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| although we do not believe that the proposed ordinance before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| will have the desired effect on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| However, we do have some specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| that we believe will improve the residential development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| that we will be happy to share with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| and we anticipate that advanced NOCs will help identify ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| that we can all work together to achieve better outcomes for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| An assertion was made recently that the BZA appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| is contributing to housing development delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| and potentially increasing the price of new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| Further, it has been claimed that in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| there's been a trend that BZA appeals are increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| and that removing the BZA appeal process would cut red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| The focus of the discussion has been on residential development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| and how they are appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| KCPA decided to compile the data on residential development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| submitted from January 2020 through July 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| to see if the data supported these assertions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| We gathered this information by reviewing Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| meeting minutes and using KGIS to confirm our results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| First slide, please. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| So the first slide shows the residential development units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| that Planning Commission came before them in January of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| through July of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| There were a total of 110 development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| representing 7,963 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| that were heard by Planning Commission during this time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| One plan representing 80 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| was denied at Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| for a total left of 7,883 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| approved by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Of those 109 approved plans representing 7,833 dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| three plans representing 161 dwelling units were appealed to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| and all three were subsequently approved within two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| two of them with minor modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2076)|
| 0:34:47| So this is just to reiterate basically what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| Some people can see graphically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Some people prefer numerically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| But basically the bottom line is that 7,883 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| were approved from January of 2020 to July of 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| and only three items went before BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| There were 16 total BZA appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| over the last 15 years for development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| Actually, there were 16 total over the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Ten of them were development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| and six of them were use on review appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| You can see from this slide there were very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| 2008 had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| It was subsequently appealed to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| 2009 had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| That was subsequently appealed to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| There were none in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| I don't have to go through and explain this one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| The most was in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| There were three development appeals filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| We're talking about very small numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| averaging less than one a year, and that's hardly a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| This year, currently, there have been two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| One was appealed to BZA and resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| and the other was appealed to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| and further appealed to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| The reason it went to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| is because it was a question of standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| So, to reiterate, our findings are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| out of only three of 109 housing-related development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| that were approved by Planning Commission since January 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| were appealed to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| These three appeals involved only 161 out of 7,883 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| approved by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| All of the appeals were affirmed or modified by BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| within two months of being heard by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| There is not a growing trend of increasing appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| of housing-related development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| that are going to BZA or court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| and today Knox County offers fewer opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| for public input on development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| than the three other metropolitan counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| in Tennessee, Memphis, Nashville, and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| KCPA concludes that the assertions about BZA appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| are demonstrably false based on this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| There is no increasing trend of BZA appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| It has not been misused in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| and eliminating appeals to the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| would not make a noticeable difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| in the number of housing units approved for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| in Knox County, nor unreasonably delay them from being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| However, eliminating the BZA appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| for development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| or giving only the developer the option to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| would significantly limit the public's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| to engage and resolve issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| without the time and expense of going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Simply put, the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| is designed to solve a problem that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| One outcome that has come out of this exercise, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| is to point out that some of the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| in our zoning ordinance is unclear and contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Given that so much valuable time has been devoted to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| I would ask that you consider amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| the existing ordinance with language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| that clarifies the BZA process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| in a way that is reasonable and fair to everyone concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| I'm sorry I went a little over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you, Ms. Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I don't see Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| If there's no objection from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| if Mr. Davis does come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| I would like to afford him the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| in the second segment of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| which is actually right next to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| So if there's no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I would like to allow him to speak when we hear this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| I reached out to Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| He's not going to make it this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| He'll be here next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Oh, okay. Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| I believe next is approval of our minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I have a motion to approve the minutes by Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| That takes us, Madam Clerk, to item 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| This is on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Item number 52, consideration of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| approving the execution of the first amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| to enter local project agreement multi-use stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| with the city of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| and the sports authority of the county of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| and the city of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| This is resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Lundy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| with a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I know we have Mr. Boyd is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Mr. Caldwell is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I believe I saw Mr. Mamentov as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Commissioners, would anyone like to hear from Mr. Boyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2423)|
| 0:40:40| We can start with Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| I'll let him go over the interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| just what's changing and the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| And then if Mr. Boyd wants to make a statement, that is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| because these are kind of back to back as far as resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| So I'll go to Mark first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| It's great to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Mark Mamentov, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| The interlocal agreement amendment that is on the agenda for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| this month has two substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| One is to raise the maximum potential true interest rate on the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| for the sports authority from 5% to 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| I'm sure you are wondering if we need that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| The answer is no, we don't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| But we're asking Mr. Boyd to commit to millions of dollars more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| ongoing cost over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| And so we felt it prudent to ask you all to increase that rate if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| We're well below 5% still, which is the current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| but we're getting closer than we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And so that's why we're asking for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| The second change in the interlocal agreement relates to the TIF that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| also on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| As you all know, and as you read in the newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and I know you've talked to Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| is that what's being proposed is that to the extent that the costs exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| what the amount of the bonds plus the state grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| plus Mr. Boyd's previous contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| that there would be a tax increment financing through KCDC to help pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| for that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| We don't know what that number would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| The maximum amount is $20 million, which is the other agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| But if we would never do this, but we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| the city and the county could essentially eviscerate that TIF by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| granting pilots throughout the area, which would be most unfair to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| And so this agreement in the interlocal agreement would protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| sports authority who will work with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Boyd to make sure that he gets the same protections that the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| pilots that we often are asked to grant on blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| that we would work with him to try to make sure that we don't weaken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| tax base in that area for which they're counting on the TIF to repay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=2579)|

| 0:54:39| We've transitioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| We've adapted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| We adjusted well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| We really just saw the Internet desert, as we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| for folks who either had really low speeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| or no speeds at all at their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| And so we saw some other communities in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| doing things to bridge that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| and hence we put together this program to sort of say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| is there a way to help fund those folks who are low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| to have the same access to high-speed Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| that's become a utility, a need for every home and area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| in the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| It does take funding, private, public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| just like we talked about the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| It does require a lot of that same kind of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| So we have talked to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| We are talking to the county today about this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| and we look to hope to launch this program in early 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| as we start to really roll out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| So how does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Any student that's in our service area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| that's in K-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| a Knox County student who meets federal guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| you see there it's 200% of federal poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| We have to have the Internet obviously available at their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| for them to be eligible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| And it will be going through CAC to be our clearinghouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| if you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| They do a lot of federal programs already doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| I don't need for us to get in that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| so they will actually be the folks who determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| if these folks are eligible as a funding mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| and this will be reviewed annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Some of the questions I receive is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| well, how do you know year-to-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Well, as you will know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| many programs federally funded require a reapplying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| So we use that same practicality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| and they will get notified every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| if they're still eligible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| As kids get in the program or graduate out of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| or if the good news is the parents make more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| that's all those things we want to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| that those folks are on the list accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| So that's how the program will work in a nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| and I can go into any detail you want on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| As you know, we pay pilots in OxyContin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| in half their years, and we will continue doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| We pay based on our gas and electric plant value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| our property value, if you want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| and some of our sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| We do give you all the maximum amount allowed by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| That's what we've done forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| To give you an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| we just submitted a check for $10.1 million in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| That's for fiscal year 22's pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| We've increased, if you look over the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| that went from $7 million a year to $10 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| So as Knox County grows, our pilots grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| pretty much block step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| And we look to add this fifth utility now to our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| It will actually increase the pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| that we give to you all every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| And hence, it's that incremental difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| that we were talking about as far as funding this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| So we do plan on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| The next chart will slide real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| I'll show you a slide of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Next one real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| The gray bars are the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| As I described, we have increased our pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| to Knox County for 10 years straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| You see the little dip in 2021, 22, 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| That's that equalization rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| So it's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| I'm not the financial guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| We'll get Mark Walker up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| But that's where we know as the tax base has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| even though our value has gone up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| the tax equivalent base has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| So it's always this dip in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| You look at the next 10 years in green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| with our electric and gas plant increasing as we grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| as we continue to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| you'll see we'll get up near $12 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| for Knox County pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| The blue is what I call the broadband pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| the new utility we're creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Those are the dollars that are above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| our standard gas and electric pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Those are the funds we're asking to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| for this low-income student Internet access program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| And as that funding becomes available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| that's our estimate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| I've proposed that those funds will be at your discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| to allow us to use that to fund those Knox County kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| that meet that criteria, as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| about two slides before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| And so this will be something you all consider for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| to consider today, next Monday, but also every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| You know, it'll be an ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| something that we want to make sure is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| It will be based on the actual build-out of our fiber system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| So those slides that we estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| will actually bring you the real numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| on how our build-out's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| We hope it's better than I expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| but we'll know when we get further along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| It does ask for a county commission for approval of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| to use those funds that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| The city has already approved as part of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| to allow us to get in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| It is a five-year term with one-year additions as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| And part of that is we need to prove it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| A lot of you ask me the question point-blank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| well, how do we know the results of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Well, our goal is to present to you annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| what are we seeing, what's the take rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| how those kids are doing as far as getting access to the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| and being able to dial in to talk to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| So part of that is a results-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| not just a neat thing that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| It does require our board and your all's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| As I said before, the city has approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| so we're moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| And we'd love for your all's questions and approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| ultimately, for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| It's been done in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| They would say it's instrumental in making those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| have the access that you and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| and re-level that playing field for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| who are getting left behind with technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| And so I'm here to answer any questions you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| about this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Thank you, Mr. Bullis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Mr. Bullis, in your presentation you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| and this is just for clarification purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| there are some schools that we have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| that the whole school is considered free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| and reduced lunch regardless of household income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| but this will be based on individual household income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| and not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Yeah, it'll be strictly based on your income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| through the CAC programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| And partly that is a limited amount of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| We'll make sure that those who need it get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| because if it gets used up by others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| it goes less far or not as far through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| So it'll be through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| So the schools that get free lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| like my son was in one of those schools for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| I wouldn't qualify, obviously, and shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| And that would be the case in this situation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| And that was going to be my next question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| is what would you use to establish those households?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| The CAC program, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| We could give you a program like LIHEAP, SNAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| There's all kinds of different criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Once again, it's 200% of poverty would be the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| If you meet that, then they give us the go-ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| to hook them up and we start making the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| and we'll make sure that they're taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| and do all the install, maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| all those types of things that we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| as a utility provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Yes, good question. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Any further questions or discussion or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Thank you, Mr. Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, Veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3684)|

| 1:02:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We don't have an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Could we make that to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| I trust we will have an amount by next week, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3738)|
| 1:02:31| He's looking it up. I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| I can get you an amount now if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| We can still vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Do you all have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| We had discussed earlier, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| some of the items that are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Do you want to go ahead and give us just kind of a quick update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| I think we had talked about the software for the juvenile court judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| That was a one-time expenditure as opposed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Yeah, so some things that are on this list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| will allow electronic health records system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| at the health department software for juvenile court judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| which is at juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| There's things on here like office renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| for general session of court judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| software that's related to the probation office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| various one-time expenses related to facility upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| at Central and the old courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| peer review for internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Tennessee Achieves for scholarship contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| There is $265,000 for cybersecurity for the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| that helps with their software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| $200,000 for them for capital equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| We're designating $1 million to them for salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3855)|
| 1:04:25| And there are other like one-time expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| capital campaign stuff for center point for Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3867)|
| 1:04:35| one-time money for animal center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| I'm not going to go through them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| but ultimately there's things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| And if you get over to engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| half a million for paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| a million dollars toward their EPW facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| It's a new facility that's going to be mainly funded by ARPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| But this is a little on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| For the same reason that we talked about with the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| it's basically construction costs are higher than they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| when we first started that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| There are some equipment items on here that Mr. Snowden asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| that we're funding through their one-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| And the foreclosed bonds have to legally be done on here every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| There's $100,000 for computer equipment for the public library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| and then $75,000 for the office for visiting Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| That total amount for this year is $7,628,071.85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3934)|
| 1:05:45| So that's the official number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| That is the official number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Well, then I'll change my motion to move from move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| with no recommendation to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| And then on the engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| the pedestrian safety, is that ADA issues? Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| Pedestrian safety, I'm going to let Commissioner Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| I know it's related to, I think it's a sidewalk project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| but he knows more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| It'll be used in several locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| one of which is the extension of the North Shore Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| potentially Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| We're doing some sidewalk repairs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| So it'll be used at just different locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| to implement the improvements that we're looking for throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| And then, Mr. Caldwell, back on the non-departmental list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| the child help, is that the second installment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| I think it's year two of three. I think that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| I think it was a three-year commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| I think us and the city both are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| And I know it's the same thing with Centerpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| with Eleanor Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| That may have been the final year of Centerpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| but city and county normally sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| and do a lot of joint capital contributions for the same purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| And then the Keep Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| is that to cover Commissioner Daley's new time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| that he's going to be spending out there collecting glitter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| How they spend their money, I can't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| But ultimately, they made a request to the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| and we both chose to fund their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4060)|

| 1:07:56| Did you have anything else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4080)|

| 1:08:10| I would like to propose, without objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| that we take a brief recess before hearing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| We will go into recess, and we will reconvene at 620.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| I'll call this work session back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| Madam Clerk, I believe we are at item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4107)|

| 1:09:02| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| If you want him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| If he doesn't want to, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| Do you need to clarify anything of this force at all or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4151)|

| 1:09:18| Are there any specific questions from the Commissioners on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| I don't see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| I mean, if there are specific questions, we can answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| We can answer anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| There's someone here representing Tim Hill, if you need to hear from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| But otherwise, if you all have spoken to Mr. Hill and you're content, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| I don't want to prolong your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| All right, seeing no questions, we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Lundy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| with a second by Commissioner Durrett to approve item 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4186)|

| 1:09:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| On page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4203)|
| 1:10:16| Madam Clerk, item 54, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| This is resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| It's a resolution accepting the new certified tax rate based on the reappraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| and establishing an official tax rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4226)|

| 1:10:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Now, I do have a question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| This requires a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Can we approve this at work session to consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| or do we need to send it with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| I would think we need to roll call vote this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| So do I have a motion to send forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| I have a motion to send forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| All in favor of moving this forward, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| That item moves forward to next week to non-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Okay, this is the resolution that was added, resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4277)|
| 1:11:31| Would you read the caption of 907, please, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| We'll do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| This is a resolution requesting us, the Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| to recommend amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| to provide and review the standards for temporary occupations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| of the A agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| This is resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| This resolution was added by Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| who is, of course, not able to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| so I might look to someone taking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| I have a motion to move this forward without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Does anybody know any of the background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| It was a late addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| I don't know the background specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| I know it has to do, I believe, with the ability for property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| to temporarily occupy campers' RVs on property under certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| But I wouldn't want to speak to much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Yeah, I don't know the specificity of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| although then maybe Mr. Snowden could enlighten us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| on other circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| But I remember within the last month or two, we had an applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| I think it was a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| an applicant who wanted to stay on property while she was building a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| but it was something, a codes thing would not allow her to stay in a camper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Where did he go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Do you remember that she wanted to stay on property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| but you said they wouldn't be allowed to do that for an extended period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| because of a zoning issue or a codes issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Our zoning ordinance does not permit someone to live in a travel trailer in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| So that's the only thing I can remember that came up of recent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| but you don't know if that had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Yeah, I haven't even seen this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| so I'll get a copy of it and look into it and be ready to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| Jim, I've had a couple of issues with people living in trailers or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| I'll check on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| I'm concerned that they'll start building a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| and then they'll decide to live in that trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| There should be a lot of sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| You've got to have electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| You've got to have water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| You've got to have a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| It's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| We also had medical hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| where a trailer would be moved in on a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| and we'll move the trailer just as soon as my parent dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Those trailers are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| We've got to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| We've had those instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| and they've gone in front of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| and they've got a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| but a note on the lot through the registrar's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| has denoted that as soon as that condition expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| that unit has to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So, yeah, it's something in a time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| and some sort of condition would need to be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| In a moment of jest, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| since Commissioner Beeler is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| and he's about to rotate off anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| we do know that he has a motor home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| that he takes all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| I'm just wondering if he doesn't have some plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| of parking himself somewhere when he retires from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Well, we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| with a second by Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| to move this forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| And just for the record, he's not coming to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Oh, that's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| That item moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Madam Clerk, Item 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| This is Ordinance O-22-6-104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| It's an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| amending the Knox County Code Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4551)|

| 1:16:10| and adding a new Subsection 6.50.08| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4570)|

| 1:16:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| with a second by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Is there any discussion of this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Yeah, I just, if it's okay with the Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| I just had a question for Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| who presented at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| I'm going to refer to the presentation that you gave us, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| I guess I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| On the bottom of, it's not numbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| on the bottom of the page with the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| you're using this development as part of the example of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4632)|
| 1:17:21| it's implied that this is not the direction we should be going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| I think is what you said, for young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| for attracting, well it says right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| keeping, attracting new business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| or keeping young people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| So, but I looked up Windermere Trails in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| These are roughly 3,000 a month rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| I looked at the photos, they're beautiful inside, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| It has two regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Region one has 27 units, completely full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| Region two has 25 units, with only four available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| Help me understand why this is not an example of what we would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| in rentals, houses, which are usually transitions for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| corporate, people here on assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| I mean, this is completely full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| It's full of people working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| $3,000 a month is not anything to shake a stick at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| These are professionals that are, it's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Isn't this exactly what the market has asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| I'm not a real estate expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| so I'm not going to talk about the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| I'm responding to the assertion that we need a faster development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| to process to build more houses to keep our young people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| And when I've talked to people that are in that age range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| they say, well, the stuff that we're building is really not attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| It's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| The market is selling houses and filling houses as fast as we can build them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| Right, because that's the only thing that's in the market is my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Well, I guess I would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I wonder how this is an example of how the direction we shouldn't be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| I mean, we are not, I have said this many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| this commission is not to taste police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Our goal is not to determine whether we would live there or we like that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| or we like the fact that it has no sidewalks or trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Somebody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| The market has shown that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| And this has given an opportunity to have an affordable opportunity to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| and work in a beautiful part of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| And I just, you know, maybe it's blending the two conversations before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| but I'm just trying to figure out how this is a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| you may not want to live here, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| You may want to live in your farm in East Knoxville, but it's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And the market has shown that people want to live in a house just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| So I guess I'm just confused as to why this is a justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| for not changing what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| The example that I showed was to show you when you drive in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| and you look at it and you say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| this is really the very floor of what our development standards require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| And the reason that people participate in the development plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| in a lot of cases, sometimes it's just an attempt to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| and raise that standard just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| But that's the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I guess my question is that's the standard that you're holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| or maybe members of your group are holding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| but who's to say that should be the standard for all of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Don't we live in a free market where people can buy a really wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| huge, giant house or a really small, modest house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| Your answer to that is it's actually up to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| to set what those standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| That's what our zoning ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Well, I bring this up because when we talk about BZA and planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| and our housing, our role in government is not to decide everything for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| It's to create an environment where people can thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| where businesses can thrive, where people can thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| where people have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| We try our best all the time to streamline all types of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| to make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| I'm somebody that would love to make so many things in government easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| to let people grow, people develop, people thrive, people live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| people succeed in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| I think we just really have to be careful to say what is one person's standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| is not necessarily what should be dictated for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| I think that that's the balancing act between how much do we regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| what is the value of your opinion versus other people's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| If somebody wants to live here and you don't think that that's good enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| what outweighs who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Anyway, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you, Kevin, for answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| Commissioner Smith and then Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Mr. Murphy, you provided us with a list of the four metros,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| Nashville, Hamilton County, Shelby County, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| You didn't provide us with the zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| or the definition of development plan according to these municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| I actually did on Saturday morning in the white paper that you all received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| That's in the table on the last page, and there's links to all the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| Their development plans are for PR plan residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| Their development plans are PR residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| or are these for more downtown development plan, high-rise kind of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| So Hamilton County uses a planned unit development, which is an overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| It's an overlay district, so some of the regulations are the base zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| So it is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| You have your base zoning, which determines your density and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| and then you do a PUD on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Shelby County, they call it a special plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| They call it planned development, but it is, again, similar to a PUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| I think it offers a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| They may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| I forget what the density formula is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| Davidson County, when we contacted them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| they let us know that while they have a PUD on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| they have actually since about 2006 been using their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Essentially, it's the exact equivalent of our planned development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| which is the one that the Belltown proposal is attempting to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| So that's what Davidson County uses for all of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Well, Belltown, that's a whole different animal than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| But that is the animal that is in use in the metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| And that's the one that requires the two-step process with three readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| So it's not a planned unit development or a PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| None of them have a planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| So they are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| They are different, but the question that we asked was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| how do you do development plans when somebody is going to do, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| apartment development or a residential detached subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| And this was the answers they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Commissioner Daley, did you ask your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Are there any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| We have a motion to move this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| All in favor of moving this forward, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| No by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And, Durrett, were there any other nos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| This item moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Commissioner Durrett and Schoonmaker are no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Moves forward, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| Item 58 we will defer until next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| since that was Commissioner Bussler's discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| But, Madam Clerk, if you'd read 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| Discussion item regarding the appointment process of the Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| under the new ordinance 0-22-6-103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| So this, of course, was brought up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| We do have a new ordinance now that governs the Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| We have a new size of the Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and that is going to require some new appointments to the Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| Mr. Moyers is on vacation this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| I did speak with him last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| and his opinion at the moment I spoke with him was that the existing members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| will not have to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Is that your understanding, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| Yes, and we wrote in there that a grandfather clause covering that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| However, there will be the need for several new appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| some from the Mayor, some from County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| My assumption is we're going to want to do those as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| i.e. September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| So I'll be in communication through the Commission Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5176)|
| 1:26:24| as to the process for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| I'm assuming we'll do that the same as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Mayor, correct me, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| the current members will be considered Commission appointments, will they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| There are three current members of the Merit Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| Jim Wright, Jr., Gina Oster, and John Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| We have one alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Ms. Oster, upon the certification of the election this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| would need to resign to take her position here on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| which would leave that spot open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Mr. Wright, Jim Wright, Jr.'s term runs through April of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| Mr. Marshall's term runs through April of 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| So those two spots would remain under the grandfather clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| and it would leave two additional spots open for our normal nominating process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| where we would call for applications from the public and interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| We would go through the normal process of hearing those one week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| and voting on them the next through a nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| And then the additional three members would be mayoral appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| that we would codify as part of the same resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| So I guess without objection, I'll have Drew send out the notice for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5264)|
| 1:27:52| The one thing I would, in normal times, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| we would keep it very short for an appointment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220815?start=5276)|
