| 0:09:50| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=591)|

| 0:09:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| It's presentation of rural metro monthly report by Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| And that will be given at our meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| Madam Clerk, we are to the public forum portion of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| We have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| It is a non-agenda item topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| However, seeing that we only have one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| if it is okay with the body to go ahead and allow this person to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| Okay, that is Ms. Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Ms. Stafford, if you will approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| and say your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Okay, I had to check mine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Debbie Stafford, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| I want to thank you for allowing me to speak to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| I came tonight mostly to welcome the newly elected Kim Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Gina Oster, and my personal district's Commissioner Rhonda Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| I would also like to extend my conservative Republican congratulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| to Kortney Durrett for being elected as chairperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Commissioner Durrett, during the COVID debacle of the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| was always receptive to my communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| even when Republican commissioners ignored me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| and even when Chairperson Durrett and I may have disagreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| I have nothing but respect for you, Chairperson Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| and I look forward to the day that we conservative Republican women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| can pull you over to the dark side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Remember, resistance is futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| And to the geeks out there, yes, that was Star Trek and not Star Wars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| I know my difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| I want to request two different things tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| One, I would like to request that the commission consider readdressing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| When we took away the ability to do appeals, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| we made it much more expensive for we, the common person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| to be able to appeal what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| That's not fair to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| In my previous life as a bookkeeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| I actually worked for a commercial developer here in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| and ran his office, so I know how the game is played,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| whose pockets are bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| theirs with millions or ours with maybe $20 left over after payday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| So I respectfully request that you all bring that back for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| The second thing, Brian Hornback recently published a blog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| that Glenn Jacobs violated the county charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| by electing a Hallsdale POW utility district board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| who has already served the eight years he is permitted to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| under our county code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Brian cited an ordinance that states members appointed to boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| authorities, and commissions is provided by provisions of the county charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| shall not serve more than eight years or two terms, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| It's my understanding that there were applicants who applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| who were willing to serve in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| So I respectfully request that you all address this apparent violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| in county code, and if there's something that we're not understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| if you could please explain it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| So now that I've got the business out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I want to talk about what's been going on in our county the last few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| and the just ridiculous harassment that has gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| to the four conservative commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| It appears, Commissioner Beeler, I apologize to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| because there's apparent gender dysphoria sweeping across the Republican men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| which many seem to have forgotten your pronouns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| as one of the people that voted for Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| I would also like to take this moment to go on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| and explain that the four evil horsemen women that voted for Courtney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| cannot pass something without more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| It's my understanding with 11 of you all that it takes a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| I'm also perplexed as to the accusation that if anything, God forbid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| were to happen to Mayor Jacobs, that Courtney would automatically assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| the throne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| The pretty faces of the Republican men seem to not understand the county charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| that if something were to happen to Glenn Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| it should be filled by the position, and you all have to hold public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| There have also been many lies coming out since Chairperson Durrett was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| I can barely keep up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| One that especially hit home to me in the heinous nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| was written by John Duncan, who went after you four women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| as the apocalyptic women that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Once again proved his gender dysphoria against Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| by leaving him completely out of the conversation as a man who voted for Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| The most heinous part of it is the fact that it was published on the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| that Rhonda Lee had the funeral for her father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| How dare those of you that treat these commissioners the way you have treated these women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| These are women who have fought life-threatening battles for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| They themselves have had cancer and gone to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| They have stood as pillars for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| How dare you all treat these women the way you have treated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| I want to remind these men that are so offended by these four women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| while ignoring Commissioner Beeler's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| You might want to talk to your doctor and find out if my doll is right for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| And remember men, your face is so much prettier when you smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| So that's about it for me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you again for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| And to all of you, may the force be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| May the odds be ever in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And to you women, blessed be the fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you, Ms. Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Madam, that concludes our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=947)|

| 0:16:14| Consideration of the clerical errors regarding the acceptance of one county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| At the July 22, 2019 County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| due to a clerical error, a portion of Mission Hill Lane located in Massey Creek Phase 1, District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| was accepted with 50-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| The correct right-of-way is 100 feet, accepted by the County Commission on July 22, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| is hereby noted and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=998)|

| 0:16:51| I have a quick question for Director Snowden regarding this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| We need a motion before we do a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1018)|

| 0:17:13| Yes, ma'am. Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Director Snowden, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| You and I have talked about this road several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| and in this community there's current litigation going on about some things happening on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1040)|

| 0:27:31| Doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| 18 and 19 really basically will be the same question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| so we could do away with 19 at the same time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Take us through the steps of how the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| and also Sturkey Elementary schools were bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Is it a bidding process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| It is a bidding process, and each of the contracts up for bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| they go through a vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| And so basically the breakdown of the rubric, it's by scoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| and it's basically qualification and experience, qualification and experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| but they're in different categories, technical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| and then there's three categories for qualification and experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| and three categories for technical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| And so what they do is they score each one of those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| The first two contracts were awarded those bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and then the other contracts were taken into consideration for any project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| $200,000 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Are these bids posted on the website that any architectural company can bid on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Yes, it is open for any architectural company to bid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Is it on the Knox County website or the county website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| I would say it was county, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| I checked the website quite often there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| You see what is being out for bid solicitations or RFQs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| So I just wanted to make sure that was the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| that it's not you've already got your three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| or four architect companies or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and you just say I'm going to give this one that one or that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| No, that's the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| and actually you're able to see the scoring for each bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and I shared that with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| but you're able to see exactly where they come in and score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| As a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| the contractors will look at that and see how they can improve their bidding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| for future bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=1776)|

| 0:35:08| will have the opportunity to approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| tell us anything you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| and I'm sure there will be commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| who will want to ask questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Just a point of order for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| On your online agenda, the way the ordinance was read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| was to purposely stagger terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| so that everybody didn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| the majority didn't roll off or on at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| and to sort of keep a constant continuity of new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| So on the online agenda is a term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| like a staggered plan, as noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| It recognizes the two current members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| of the Merit System Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Mr. Wright and Mr. Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| It also recognizes the three may roll appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| in one, two, or three-year increments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and then also shows the two vacant positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| also in two- or three-year increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| So I just wanted to point that out before we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| And if this term she just adopted along with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I mean, it's sort of part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| but it would kind of create for a healthy turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| long into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| And as members would roll off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| they would sort of continue on three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| So this just sort of starts everybody off on a staggered plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| and then going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| it would be a traditional three-year term for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Yes, does the sponsor of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| want to make a motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2199)|

| 0:38:29| and bring a various type of background to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| So my background has been in manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I've worked in the plastics industry most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| and here in the Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| and across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| At one time, I owned the largest plastic recycling company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| and my customers were people like Denso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and the city of Morristown was one of my accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| I dealt with the city of Morristown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| and Anchor Brush in Morristown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and American Fence in Mossheim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And so my point is, is over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I've had a lot of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| with a lot of different types of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Everybody from city managers and politicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| down to people that don't even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| have never been to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Immigrants, you know, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| And then when, unfortunately, when NAFTA came along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| a lot of businesses like mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| and a lot of the plastics businesses went overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| So I had to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| So I went and got my real estate license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| and I've been working in real estate here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| And when our current sheriff was first elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| first elected, not this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| but I went to him and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| well, what can I do for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| And I said, well, what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| is what can I do for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| And he says, well, do you have anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| that's on the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| And I said, well, no, no, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I said, I just think maybe you need a little help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And so, but that's not saying that he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| not an able man at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| He's a good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| But I think this would be a nice opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| to bring in a little fresh blood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| into this organization, this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| and maybe we can be of help in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| and maybe down the road maybe some other things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Because I think it's a matter of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| that our police and our sheriff need a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| And so I do want to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| And I'll yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you, Mr. Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioners, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Mr. Benedict, please stay at the podium, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Yes, I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| First being, do you have any ties to the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| I do not have any relatives working for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| Like everybody else that grows up in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| everybody knows somebody that works for the sheriff or the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I know people, but I do not at the current time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| I have no relationship with anybody at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| And my second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| do you have any experience in HR, human resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| In what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Just as Brennan, a company that had 225 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| But that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you, Mr. Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you for coming and standing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| I've been over there on that side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| so I know it's a little nerve-wracking sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| But I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Have you ever campaigned for any candidate for sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| And then how would you approach a grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| that's been brought to the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| that calls into question the operations of the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| Meaning, do you feel like that you can be fair and open on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I don't see why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| I am not offering to do this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| because I'm mad at the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| or I think there's anything wrong with the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| I'm here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I have no grievances or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| And you are familiar, because I know that you've probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| you said that you've talked to some members of the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| that sit on there currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So you are aware that the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| was actually started as a protection committee for officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| that it really doesn't have anything to do with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| It's just for the officers and their protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Yes, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I understand that all across America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| there are groups of people like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| and they can be of great help to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| because they don't necessarily have a dog in the fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| and they're not being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Their salary is not at stake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| because there's no income associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| So I'm hoping that you will get good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| based on the rules and regulations that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you again for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| To follow up on Commissioner Oster's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| do you have any intentions to run for any elected position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Would you have any intentions in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| to run for an elected position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Will you follow the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| and the Merit Council Ordinance that was passed by this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Is there any other discussion or questions for Mr. Benedict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Our next applicant is Michael Crichton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| Sir, would you please approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| state your name and county of residence for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| and anything you would like the commission to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| My name is Michael Crichton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I live in the Halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I'm new to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| I moved here in 2020 in the height of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| crossing the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| That was quite an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| But before that, my background is from 1973 to 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| I was a law enforcement officer in Southern California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| I was trained by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| I worked subsequently for the El Segundo Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| and the Riverside County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| I held all ranks from patrolman to lieutenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| I did detective work, corrections work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| I worked in court services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| I worked in dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| And very limited stint in personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2748)|
| 0:45:58| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| At the conclusion of a 30-year career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| my degree, college degree is in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| My late wife gave me 90 days of retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| and threw the Los Angeles Times at me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| find a job and get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| So I found a job teaching school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| I thought it might be easier to head off troubled youth earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| because several times I arrested people for three generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| in the same family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| And I thought I might actually be able to do some good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| And I thought I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| My late wife, she died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| I remarried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| My new wife and I, we moved to Wyoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| where I continued to teach school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| And subsequently, my old police partner is a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| of Sweetwater, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| He called me up December of 2019 and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| hey, would you like to come out and visit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Well, I looked outside my window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| I had five feet of snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| It was 25 below zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And I said, Earl, we'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| So we came out here and got to talking and looking around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| and decided, gee whiz, this is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| The weather's nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| The people are nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| And so I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I'm offering my services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| I continue to volunteer work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| I work with Beaver Dam Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| the Wednesday night kids program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| So I'm offering what services I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| if you think that I'm a good candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you, Mr. Crichton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| The first slide I saw was Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Mr. Crichton, first off, welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Welcome to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Glad to have you in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Did you, during your time in the Riverside County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| or Los Angeles County or El Segundo Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| did you interact at all with a similar type of merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| or merit system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| And if so, in what way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| The only real function was the city of Moreno Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| They were a contract city for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| And they had a board where they wanted to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| in all facets of police work, whether they were trained or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| And a lot of that involved grievances and personnel issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| such as not only demoting people or whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| but even transferring people on a promotion basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| They wanted to be involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| So I think that was a seven-member department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| And as one of the administrative lieutenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| I did deal directly with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| Next we have Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Mr. Crichton, welcome to Halls and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I want to ask my question to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Do you have any human resource experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| No, not directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| I dealt with county human resources in the matter of grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| to try to resolve those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| but no real one-on-one direct contact with county personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| So you sat on a grievance board then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| As the administrative lieutenant, I supervised 419 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| and sat on a budget of $62 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| So I was involved in every aspect of scheduling, evaluation, hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| firing, and promoting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| But that was within the Sheriff's Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| not really with the county personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| Commissioner Oster, is that your light, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you so much for being here and welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| I'm going to ask the same question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Since you've actually dealt with grievances in your past in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| how would you approach a grievance that's being brought to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| that calls into question the office of the Knox County Sheriff's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| The first thing I want to do is always get all the information and facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| without making any prejudgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| And a lot of times you deal with the same personnel issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| with the same personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| And you don't want to form an opinion ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| You want all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And that's what I always look at is who can provide the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| and then you make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| Commissioner Daly, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| The only question I'll ask you, sir, and thank you for applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| and welcome to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Will you follow the bylaws and the Merit Council Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| that's passed by this county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| In my adult life I have always dealt with positions of responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| and authority and I have maintained the oaths that I took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3111)|
| 0:52:00| Madam Chair, just for information purposes, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| are these positions sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| I don't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Are these positions sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Raise the right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Raise the right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| That's very important that you will follow the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| and the ordinances that are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| Are there any other questions for Mr. Crichton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3147)|

| 0:52:38| Mr. Dingus, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| He will not be able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Our next applicant is Mr. Carl Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| I go by Dennis Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I just said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Will you say your name and county of residence for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Carl Dennis Ford, 5806 Thorpe Grove Park, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Lifelong resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| I have a precept, I guess, that a lot of folks don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| because I bring to my application the fact that I hung around the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| as a sheriff's son and looked at it all my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| as having the sheriff's office as part of my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| When I came out of the military and served in Vietnam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| I went to work for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| I was working at the sheriff's office when they established the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| So I left and went into the business world about that same time, so I didn't go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| So I have watched as I have lived in Knox County most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| except for the time that I was a Methodist pastor for 31 years, which I just retired from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| But during those times, I've served on two different boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| that Knox County Commission has appointed me to, to the Jail Inspection Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| and I was a charter member of the E911 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| And as I left it to go, because I was moving in the ministry, I was the chair of the E911 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| So I bring that perspective of the relationship with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| and how the citizens participate in the different duties of what goes on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3271)|
| 0:54:41| I see it as an opportunity as I've gotten older and semi-retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| I'm also currently the pastor at San Branch Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| but I've got the time and the energy and the experience over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| to put some input into something as I grow older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| And my experience with the sheriff's office and with running committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| and being on committees in Knox County brings me a perspective of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| that I want to use for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| To put it bluntly, I'm not ready for the rocking chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| and I want to be engaged in how Knox County is run, and I've got a heart for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| And I realize, as your question will be, that the sheriff's merit system was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| to have a place for the employees to be able to go and have someone else look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3328)|
| 0:55:38| at what they were charged with or what they were accused of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| And I will use those guidelines that you have written out for the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| to judge those people by the facts, using those guidelines that should be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| to each and every deputy that's hired, use those guidelines to judge that one decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| based on no precepts, no prejudice to anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| Yes, I have supported the sheriff at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| But as a pastor, I also have to be very discreet in how I support somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| So I don't support them publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| I might tell my family who I'm going to vote for, but other than that, that's all it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| And I think that carries over, if I'm reading what you have drawn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| how you want the merit system people that are on the board to conduct themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| I'll be glad to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Jay, I saw your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Mr. Ford, do you have any family members that are currently working in the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| with the Knox County Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| And are you, it sounds like you are aware of the provisions in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| outlining that each board member shall have no active participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| in any political interests or political races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| I guess you kind of answered my question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| But I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| I appreciate that you understand the fact that this merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| is actually designed to protect officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| And that is extremely important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Also, that you, you know, we're really trying to get away from the politics of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| And I guess that you probably understand that on a different level being a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| It's something that you kind of have to keep quiet, like you said, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| So I don't really have anything else for you except to thank you for coming down and being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3467)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Commissioner Lee, I saw your light next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Yes, Mr. Ford, I see you're an Army veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| My question to you is do you have any human resource experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Do I have what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Human resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| As an income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Like, have you dealt with employees, have you hired employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| And human resources, as past construction, yes, I had employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3503)|
| 0:58:31| I dealt with that on the 9-1-1 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| I have dealt with that as having numerous employees as a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| But other than human resources and government, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Were you on the 9-1-1 board in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Mr. Ford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| In our packet, we have about a half a page email from you, and that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| Did you have any supporting documents that you sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| Because I noticed that you have an incorrect commission at knoxco.org address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3548)|
| 0:59:15| and so we have no, like, work history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Did you submit any documents like that or just the half-page email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| Just the half-page email with my background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| I did not support, did not see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| So you didn't say, like, you've worked for this company for X number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| And then you say you have a certificate in criminal justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Is that one of those where it's the, for any law enforcement officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| where it's a two-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| That is from Walter State Community College back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Mr. Ford, do you have any future intentions to run for any elected position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| Lord, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Smart man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| I know you have said you would, but I'm just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| and to all the candidates, you will have to raise your right hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| and promise, I might want to use the word swear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| but promise that you will follow the bylaws and the ordinance of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3622)|

| 1:00:30| Confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| I will raise my hand to that, and I expect employees to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| and I expect other board members to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Are there any other questions for Mr. Ford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| Thank you, Mr. Ford, for applying, and we appreciate your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Our next applicant is Christopher Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Sir, would you please approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| state your name and county of residence for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| and tell us anything you would like commission to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Christopher Manning, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| First thing I would like to advise the commission of is I was appointed in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| as the alternate for the preexisting Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| and served on that until the reconfiguration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| and I was not appointed to one of the existing positions on the new council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| so I was recommended to reapply, so that's what I'm doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| participating in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Hopefully all of you have had an opportunity to review my resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| and to answer some of the questions I've heard earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| I have approximately five years' experience in HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| specifically with the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and in dealing with grievances and transfers and discipline and all of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| I have 18 months' experience in internal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| and I have the unique experience of when I was an officer and a detective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| I served on the union board for four years on the grievance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| and one term as president of the union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| And with the grievance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| I was a representative in the appeals process where you would actually have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| with the department head, which was the chief of police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| and then if that was appealed, there was an administrative judge that was selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| and there was actually a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| It was not public like the merit council is here, but it was a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| So I'm very fortunate that during my early part of my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| I had a lot of experiences in personnel and HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| and then when I was promoted and became a manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I was on the other side of the table with providing discipline, direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| and training to employees, and on the very rare occasion we had to terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| So I do have that experience also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Thank you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Manning, first I want to thank you for serving in the capacity you did as the alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| and I appreciate you applying and sort of doubling down on your willingness to serve the community in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3789)|
| 1:03:18| No doubt you have extensive background training and credentials in sort of everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| that the merit council is for and the purpose of it and the actions it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| In the time that you did serve as the alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| is there a way you could summarize the importance and some of the takeaways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| that you learned from being in the trenches versus being a new applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| So as has been stated earlier, it is actually, Commissioner Oster said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| it is quite daunting for the employees to come before the council, rather intimidating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| and I look at the role as you're going to be the trier of fact, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| You're going to look at the facts and not allow personal opinions or influence the outcome of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| I did want to compliment the legal council that were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| They were all very prepared and professional, and they were advocating in an appropriate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| It was very, very well done, and thanks to the chair who managed herding cats on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| But it was unique because I'm not used to the public aspect of the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| and so that's a very interesting dynamic where it's broadcast on television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| where these people are having to discuss possibly a mistake that they made in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| and they're having to air it, so that's a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| I didn't ask Mr. Manning to say that, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| But I did have the opportunity to serve with Mr. Manning while I was on the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| and he was always very prepared and very professional, and I appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| Since you've already kind of been in the trenches and you kind of know what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| I really respect the fact that you want to come back and you want to do it again because it takes a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| I do want to ask, have you ever campaigned for any candidate for sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Yes, and when the current sheriff ran his first term, I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| but then once I applied for this position, I didn't participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| And then since you've actually been involved in one of the grievance hearings that we did have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| do you want to kind of just touch on how, as being the alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| how you felt like you could approach if there was issues going on with the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| Well, I feel I'm a people's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| The folks that are out day-to-day going about their lives, the paid employees are the folks that work for the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| and they're pretty much unpaid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| We represent their best interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| So it's never a bad idea to have extra sets of eyes on the decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| And I have personal experience from actually meeting out discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| where employees will bring in mitigating facts or factors that were not part of the investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| and it's not by malfeasance of the investigator, just for some reason or other didn't come to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| And so I look at the merit council as an opportunity for the employee to come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| can you consider this because I did or did not present it to the investigator, it was not part of the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| I think it's just another opportunity to make sure that we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Again, I want to thank you and commend you for wanting to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| and also for the work that you go in and do with the girls in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| I know that they feel very respected by you, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Commissioner Daly, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you for your service in the past there, and I'll ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4044)|
| 1:07:32| I know you've raised your right hand this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| but I want to make sure that everybody understands that the bylaws and ordinances must be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4057)|
| 1:07:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| So will you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| Seeing no other lights on, Mr. Manning, thank you again for your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Our next applicant is Mr. Stephen Weiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| Mr. Weiner, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| State your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Stephen Weiner, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| All the applicants here today are here because they feel compelled to serve those who serve us each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| I believe that my previous experience in mental health, along with my legal training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| is a great combination of serving on the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| When I was a counselor, I worked every day to resolve conflicts and bring people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| In doing so, I employed a fundamental strategy of fairness and inherent justice that I still follow today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| I believe that asking the right questions, by asking the right questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| those in conflict can be brought together into a win-win, mutually satisfactory solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| As a demonstration, for sake of example, let's say you're waiting in line in the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| The person in front of you takes the last orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| You want to make some marmalade later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| You want to have the peel to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| So you ask the person in front of you, why do you want the orange?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| What do you want to have with that orange?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| And they say, I want to have some slices of orange for lunch later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| So by asking that question, you get what you want, which is the orange peel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| and the other person gets what they want, which is the slices of orange for lunch later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| Where there is conflict, there is now agreement, and everybody gets what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| I still strive to bring people together and mitigate conflict in my law practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| As most attorneys will tell you, reducing the potential for conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| and resolving conflicts at an early stage saves everyone both financially and emotionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| An example of this in my practice is by clearly drafting a state planning documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| that is unambiguous and clear in intent so as to prevent any potential litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| amongst the possible litigants or claimants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| I'm also aware that when all parties to a dispute are afforded due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| before a neutral decision-making body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| not only can the parties have confidence in the process, but the public can as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| Should I be selected to join this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I will always act in the best interest of justice without partiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| We owe it to our officers, our sheriff, and our public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| With that, I'll await your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Thank you, Mr. Weiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Commissioner Jay, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Mr. Weiner, as outlined in your resume and it's probably pretty well known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| you've been very active politically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| serving as an officer in one of the local political parties running for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and being active in other people's campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| If appointed to this position and selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| are you willing to give all that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| and remain in an apolitical state during your term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| having no political donations, active campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| as it's outlined in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| To the extent the ordinance follows state and federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| I will observe the ordinance and the restrictions imposed by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| It doesn't sound like you agree with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I think you were active in saying that you didn't believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| that part of the ordinance was legal during the process of our hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| We have constitutional rights in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Those rights are given to us by God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| and it's not this body or anybody else's right to take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| And if that disqualifies me, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| So do you believe the ordinance is legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| I believe that the ordinance has some conflicts with state and federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| namely the Little Hatch Act and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| Okay, I'll take that as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| So, Mr. Weiner, you have been in the politics world before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| and have you ever campaigned for any candidate for sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| And on the committee for the Merit Council, as I've stated to the other applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4338)|
| 1:12:27| that you understand, and I believe that you do from what you've sent previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| that the Merit Council is set up for protection of the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| How would you approach a grievance that's been brought to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| that calls into question the operations of the Knox County Sheriff's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| It's always important to act with impartiality and fairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| and not prejudge any dispute that comes before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| That is my belief in applying for this, and that's my belief now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Also, one thing I want to add, too, to follow up on a previous comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| I have no present intentions of running for office, if that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Thank you for coming and being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| You may have just made the statement that you have no intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| Do you have future intentions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I mean, the future's not here until tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| so I have no present intentions of running for office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| This question, will you raise your right hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| will you follow the bylaws in the Merrick Council Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| passed by this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| I'll give you the same response that I gave to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| To the extent that it follows state and federal law, I will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Steve, I was glad to see that on your resume that you said you're an Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| I think that's a pretty good accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| I just was glad you took the time to include that on your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| Seeing no more lights on, Mr. Weiner, thank you so much for your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| Our last applicant is Mr. Daryl Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| and he is unable to be here tonight, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| So that takes us back to our motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| Madam Chair, before we pass that, if I could just have a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I just want to take a moment to say thank you to Commissioner Oster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| for her service on the Merrick System Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| It shouldn't go without notice that she spent many, many years serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| and is also serving as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| and only had to resign due to becoming a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| but I want to say thank you for your service to the community on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| very, very important board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| In my haste to have this motion move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| I skipped over any more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Looking forward to next week, how will the voting process go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| In other words, we have an applicant for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| and then an applicant for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Will we be taking all applicants voting on a two-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| then settle that, then take the remaining applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| and do a three-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| That is how I plan for the nomination process to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| And it will be specified before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| I want to recognize Mr. Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| Did he leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| He's the mayor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Is Mr. Boatman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Or Ms. Lindsay Willis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| I just wanted to recognize them if they were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| so we could put a face with a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you, Commissioner Daly, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Is there any more discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4574)|

| 1:16:22| The motion on the floor is to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| with no recommendation by Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Seeing no other discussion, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| That motion carries to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4595)|
| 1:16:45| On page 7, item number 40, Resolution 404,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| it's approving a local agency project agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| with the Tennessee Department of Transportation, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| for the development and construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| of a pedestrian bridge over State Route 131, Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| from Gibbs Elementary Middle School to Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Motion to approve by Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Mr. Snowden, we had talked previously about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| but if you would kind of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| what the process is for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| and what Knox County's commitment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| Sure, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| This is what's called a Transportation Improvement Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| that we have applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| TDOT hasn't actually awarded that grant yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| so in preparation of either receiving the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| or oftentimes you can reapply for the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| There's no restrictions against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| So TDOT, that grant specifically only pays for construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| so this design process would be funded by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| regardless whether we get the grant or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Obviously, we're very hopeful we get the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| We think we make a good case for the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| but we just want to keep that process moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| keep momentum moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| so that when and if we get the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| we're kind of shovel-ready to the point of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Because the design and the environmental assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| may take as much as a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| so we just want to keep that process moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| should we get the grant this year or next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| And what was the cost for the construction of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| your estimation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| I think our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| And I'm going off memory here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I think it was somewhere between $2.5 and $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| We looked at the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| the school system build out at South Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| It's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Our bridge is a little bit longer span,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| will require a little more larger supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| so we anticipated...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Our construction cost may be quite a bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| I think that one was around $1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| And if we don't get the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| will this be something you'll include in a future capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| It could be, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| We would need to consult with the mayor and the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| but, yes, that would be our intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| is to move forward even if we don't receive the grant this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Actually, the timeframe for grants is open back up for the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| so we've already applied for next year also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| just in the event we don't receive this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| And the good thing about this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| this contract does not hold us to any construction dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| We can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| If we never receive the grant and this body never chooses to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| we don't have to move forward with the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| And what would be the estimated engineering costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| the architectural costs or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| You know, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $350,000 to $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| It's a pretty significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| just because of the process that TDOT makes you follow is pretty laborious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| And I'd like to hear from my colleague in the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| if he feels this is something that the community definitely needs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| I mean, this is a topic we've been discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| for most of the four years that I've been on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| was the need for a pedestrian bridge at Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Gibbs is a little bit unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I don't think it's the only school that's like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| but it's certainly one of the few where you have three school campuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| right there on either side of a major state artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| For North Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| North Knox County Tazewell Park is certainly one of the major state arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| It is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| We had a near fatality where a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| about three years ago at a high school football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| And so the need is definitely there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| Several of you participated in the ceremonial groundbreaking that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| where we felt it was appropriate to name this bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| in honor of Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss, who gave his life in Afghanistan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| So, yeah, I think it's a commitment that Knox County has made to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| and I think it's a definite need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| So I am all for moving forward with this in all the ways that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| short of receiving the funding for all the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| So thank you for that opportunity to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you, Mr. Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| Yes, ma'am, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I appreciate very much that your department is so willing to step in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| especially if the state's willing to provide the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| and then you're willing to put the manpower and time behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| I know in my own district I've got two projects currently pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| maybe more than that, but two for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| and I have heard you comment about you can only do so many at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| and move so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| So could you give us any time frame on this bridge project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| Yeah, this project would be locally managed, i.e.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| we would do the management of the design and the right-of-way if need be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| whereas some of the projects that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| the Harrell Road being one that's on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| is going to be managed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| The wheels turn a little slower at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| so I think we could move this process along a little quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| The environmental impact is always the thing you just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| You don't know what you're going to run into out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| I've seen some of those run for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| but this one I don't anticipate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| I would like to think that the design process for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| would probably take between 12 and 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| and then we could most likely go to construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| maybe the spring of 2024 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| It is a kind of involved process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| because you're using federal money bypassed through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| and the federal regulation is just a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Is that the same process as the other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| that you and I have worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| in that the money comes from a separate entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| be it state or federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| but all of the management and supervision and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| is actually done by Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| That's some of the negotiations we have with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| We prefer to manage them ourselves internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| TDOT, obviously a big agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| Sometimes if you're in Nashville managing a project in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| that project may be not as important to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| as it is to somebody in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| So we like to manage those internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| because we can kind of push them along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| whereas if it's managed out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| sometimes it does slow the process down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| I just want to say that I am totally in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| because the pedestrian bridge at South Dole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| and we need to make sure there's fences, I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| When I was seeing it built, I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I don't know if this is going to work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| You know, I really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| And then as it started being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| and I seen fencing going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| and we funneled the students to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| They have to go to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| And they're funneled there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| It's made safety there, traffic flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| I went through there today at 20 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Now they go at 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| And, you know, the students are crossing the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| It takes them just a little bit longer to get to class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| but the safety factor of putting up the fencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| keeping the students funneled in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| to cross that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| and hopefully, I know a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| probably park across at the elementary school and walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| We still need to funnel them to that bridge somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| And I'm sure you guys will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| And Commissioner Dago, one of the things that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| there may be an area where the pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| take the path of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| And there is a spot that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| we might be able to get a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Instead of bringing the pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| down the middle school access road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| and then backtracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| actually maybe having a greenway connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| from the middle school parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| down closer right at the bridge proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| So we're trying to look, because you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| people are going to take the path of least resistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| and we want to design to that if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| The motion on the floor is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| by Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| If it is of the pleasure of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| I would like to move to take a quick 15-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| We will return at 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| I would like to call our meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5193)|
| 1:26:42| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| The next item is on page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| It's item number 43, resolution 502.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| It's approving three 12-month memorandums of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| with Carnes Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| Knox County Rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| for the provision of fire rescue emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| Motion to approve, made by Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| I guess Dwight Vanderveet probably would be the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5238)|
| 1:27:31| Thank you, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| With this MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| the Carnes Fire Department will get $218,420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| The Knoxville, excuse me, Knox County Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| will get $283,755.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| And the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| $283,755.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| And the Seymour Fire Department will get $102,825.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Is there any restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| on how these three entities can spend those county funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| Yes, sir, they'll typically just spend them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| on general operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| Okay, so this is not going for equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| but just general salaries, everything included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| In general operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Yes, sir, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| I might defer to Jenny on the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| of how the money are to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| In the committee context, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| it hasn't been extensively discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| We have focused on finding a formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| that appropriates based on a set of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| that all members of the committee were comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| So I don't know that we've actually gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| way down into the weeds as to what specific items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| that the agencies might acquire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| whether they're capital or operations, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| They do have a memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| It gives us some contractual leverage over them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| when the funds convey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| but typically I don't think they submit an equipment list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| They can actually buy equipment with their funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| if it's a capital equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| However, anything over $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| has to be titled to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Ms. Holden, will you state your name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| Jenny Holden, 603 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| Commissioner Frazier, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Thank you, Madam Chair, Director VandeVeet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| and also Ms. Holden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| First, I want to thank you both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| and also some of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| who have served on the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| I've sat in on a couple of those meetings, more than a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| and, you know, emergency services in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| is a very unusual model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| Most folks don't realize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| that we have non-profits involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| we have for-profits involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| our citizens are paying subscriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| and so one thing that I requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| and maybe the body would also like copies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| are the 990s of those three agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| just so you can take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| and see how their funding is being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| Also, I wanted to just ask a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| if any of the agencies are here and present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| if they had anything they'd like to say to address the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| if they potentially had any capital projects in the works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| would that impact potential subscription rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| going up for our citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Just give them the opportunity to speak if they would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| I have seen Chief Rose from the Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| Just for the record, we didn't ask the agencies to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| so please don't draw anything from the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| that others may not be represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| they were not tasked with being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Certainly we can have them here in the future if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| But I wouldn't want you to think that they were not here deliberately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| they just simply weren't here because we didn't ask them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Chief Rose is here, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| and Julie Green is here from the Rescue Squad as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| While Chief Rose is coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| can I, Madam Chair, just very briefly apologize to the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| When spread of record was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| I suggested to the Merit Council appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| that the legislative action had been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| so there was no need to hang around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| So I apologize to Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| it wasn't an intent not to have them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| but the legislative side of their appointment process was complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| so I suggested to them if they had other commitments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| to feel free to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| But they only did so because we suggested to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| that the legislative side was complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| I just wanted to face with the name, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| My name is Julie Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| I'm the Executive Director of Knox County Rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| and it was a pleasure that I present to you our new chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Chief Ed Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| He was recently appointed by our board to serve Knox County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| We currently do not charge subscription rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| I didn't have a question for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| I had a question for Mr. Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| I'm still waiting my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Does anyone have a question for Chief Rose or Ms. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| My only question is do we have an approved list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| on what they can purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| They're not purchasing TVs for their clubhouse kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| and it has to go to certain functional objects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| for the services and such with the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| Typically program areas, but, again, for small-dollar purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| we would not ordinarily oversee those on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| As Jenny said, on any vehicle or any asset titled over $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| those assets are titled to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| They're left in the possession of the agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| but the asset actually is the property of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| Okay, but we don't track where the money actually goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| They don't hand us a receipt at the end of the year saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| hey, this $25,000 or $24,000 of taxpayer dollars went towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| Commissioner, they do file quarterly reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| so expenditures and income and that sort of thing are tracked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| and then we also follow their 990s, their IRS 990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| and we will circulate those to the body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| They're all also, by the way, 501c3s operating under the governance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| that 501c3s operate with bylaws, boards of directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| and the general oversight that goes to a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| You have the nine, whatever the nine tax forms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| We've seen them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| I've seen them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Jenny sends them out, and we can start sending them to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| and there are quarterly reports, on-time performances and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| It's nothing that – it's something that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| It's something that you guys, if you don't see, but if you want to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| we can forward it on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| I do know that Seymour, they are not a subscription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| It's all donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| It probably costs $300,000-plus a year to run the two stations in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5671)|
| 1:34:40| $102,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| They took about a $30-some-odd-thousand hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| Now that's $30,000 more that we've got to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| and raise to make that $300,000 to make up for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| and just to run the two stations at Johnson University and on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| You all probably already know, but it's not the fire calls that are going on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| It's car wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| I fell and I can't – I need somebody to help assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| Those are the calls that have taken up a lot of their time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| The fire standards that – Chief Rose knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| He's been in the business for 40 years or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| Our fire standards are to the point to where they're pretty safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| You can get there and put the fire out and save the house type deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| Now where it used to, it just burned like a matchbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| I see this as a great thing for the citizens, out in the rural areas especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5737)|
| 1:35:44| If I didn't, I would sure tell you that it would not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| but this is a great asset that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| One of the first times I went to a commission conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| and they started talking about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| one started talking about ambulance service and they started talking about fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| And what they tell us, John, you do not want to be in ambulance service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| and you do not want to be in fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| So this little bit of money that we're helping these fire departments and the rescue squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| that's small change, but what it would cost if we had to go to a fire tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| to do a countywide fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| And Madam Chair, if I could just clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| it would be important to me that the body understands as chair of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| these are not recommendations of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| These recommendations came out of your Fire and Technical Rescue Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| Fire and Technical Rescue Committee is a subcommittee of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| The member agencies have spirited debate, like you might expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| when you set a bunch of nonprofit organizations down together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| to divide up limited amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| But they use a good formula that was developed by Mr. Benshoof in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| They're honest and candid with each other and fair with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| And these recommendations came out of the finance subcommittee of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| with unanimous recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| and then came out of the committee itself to this body with unanimous recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| So I just want to say this is the will of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| the will of the agencies that are represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| and not the will of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you, Mr. VandeVeet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| This could be a question for Mr. VandeVeet or Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| who serves on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| I don't think anybody else serves on it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| The two of the departments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| Horns Fire Department is a subscription-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| and Knox County Rescue, although it's not a subscription base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| is essentially staffed by Rural Metro still, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| which is a subscription-based service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| I've had several constituents over the years basically asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| help me understand, I'm a subscriber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| I pay my dues to Rural Metro or Horns Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| especially the Horns district out in the 6th area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| District 6 area, and then my taxpayer money pays for them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| I'm being double-taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Has anybody in the committee ever reconciled that sort of philosophical argument of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| I've got to pay and then I've got to pay again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| but yet there's still a whole lot of people that don't pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| which makes me pay more again and more again again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| I will give that to Jenny and Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| They're more on that financial side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| Yes, that's being talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Does Seymour have Rural Metro staffing too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Chief Rose may want to address this or Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| I don't know about what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| Just a thought or two on subscription services, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| Remember that subscription services are voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| So Rural Metro's penetration is, I think, around 50% of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| I do not know what Karn's penetration is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| I think it's similar, 50%, 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| But those folks who subscribe choose to subscribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| I am a subscriber, subscriber of Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| In terms of the issues of equity and fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| they get a little bit more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| We don't have subscribers to the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| But when you think about the squad and the funding that we have put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| Rural Metro helps staff those trucks through the arrangement that you've alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Now, that is coming to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| This is a dynamic environment, and that is going to change next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| and a lot of things will look different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| But we do our best to recognize as much fairness and equity as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=5995)|
| 1:40:03| based on population density, based on calls for service, and based on safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| We can't fix the rest of it at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| I think it will get better over time, but I am a Rural Metro subscriber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| It's about $600 or $700 a year, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| But I am grateful for the funds that are going to Karn's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| and I'm grateful for the funds that are going to the squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Fair enough. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| Is there any other discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| Page 8, item number 48, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| It's approving a defined services contract among Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| the City of Knoxville, and Young-Williams Animal Center of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| to promote the responsible care and welfare of animals with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| and the City of Knoxville, each paying the amount of $1,075,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| for the term of July 1st, 2022, through June 30th, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| with the option to extend for four additional years, one year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| Motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| This is submitted by Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Do they want to respond to this, or does the Director of Young-Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Well, I have questions specifically on the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| so maybe the Director of Young-Williams, Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6118)|
| 1:42:06| As you approach the podium, please state your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| Good evening. Janet Testerman, 3201 Division Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Councilwoman Testerman, we've known each other a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| But you know that as an elected official that we have to do our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| when we sit on this body here, so I'm going to ask some very pointed questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| And the reason we're deferring this until next Monday for formal action is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6153)|
| 1:42:41| at about after 3 o'clock today, we got the quarterly performance measures report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| and several of the members on this body were in the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| so we were not able to review those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| So on page 1 of the contract, it says that the agency is responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| for the care and welfare of animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| What is actually the classification of animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| As far as Young-Williams Animal Center is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| that means any animals, pets, everything but equines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| So we take in all domestic dogs, cats, reptiles, farm animals, barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6198)|
| 1:43:26| Okay. So do you take cows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| We would take cows if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Do you have facilities for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| We currently have an MOU with Zoo Knoxville, and we are not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| We're waiting on some infrastructure to be finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| but we expect that to be in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| Okay, but you can't currently take it there yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| We could if we needed to adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| And then under your scope of services, you've got a caption here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| emergency care to prevent suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6240)|
| 1:44:08| I know you have, what is it, two veterinarians on staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| We have three full-time veterinarians and five part-time veterinarians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| So what is the procedure if Knox County Animal Control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| brings a dog that's been injured due to being run over on a Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| at 7 o'clock at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| What's the usual procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| Generally, they, you know, often they can take it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| if it's emergent and urgent, can take it to UT Vet Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6277)|
| 1:44:44| They can also bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| We do have on-call staff, including our medical director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| or another veterinarian or our other staff who will come in and assess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| and treat the situation and do triage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| And what if it's at the point where the dog really needs to just be put down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| We have on-call staff that are euthanasia certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| that will come in and perform euthanasia services 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| And then this contract, along with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| we're, it's about a million dollars from each entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| What kind of percentage is that of your total operating budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Roughly a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Okay, so one-third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| In the last 30 days, Knox County Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| you have a caption that they call emergency status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| where our Knox County Animal Control cannot bring animals to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| And that was out of the last 30 days, I believe there was 12 active days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| that you were on this emergency status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| And it's my understanding that you all were doing a great community service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| in bringing in the out-of-state beagles and boarding them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| but at the same time, we didn't have a place for Animal Control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| to bring our animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| And so it's my understanding that they either had to leave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| where they observed, where they would normally have picked them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| they had to leave them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| So let me clarify and explain a little bit about that bit of discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| So when Animal Control is asked to go on emergency only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6387)|
| 1:46:36| and by our request, there has been occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| where Animal Control has gone on emergency only on their own volition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6399)|
| 1:46:46| not with our request, be it understaffed or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| That's not, y'all can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| But emergency only is, we're seasonal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| so we're at a very populated time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| So in August alone, we took in 1,100 animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| which is more animals than we've taken in since 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| So over the last three and four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| we have broken intake records for five and six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| So we are always full this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| This is not unusual for us to periodically have to go on emergency only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| which means really bringing in animals that are really addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6447)|
| 1:47:35| the public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| There are other circumstances where an animal doesn't have to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| immediately or is emergent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| As it comes to the beagles, which was the largest rescue in U.S. history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| we did take in some beagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| However, those beagles either were pre-adopted before they arrived in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| Knoxville or went directly into foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| So they were not coming in and taking up kennel space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| When we go on emergency only, it's because we have zero kennel space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| or not more than five kennels open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| So it's really two completely different circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| And then this contract really only went up $25,000 from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| Is that basically correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| On the county site, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Well, $50,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Oh, $50,000 each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| For the city and the county, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Well, and again, we do appreciate what Young-Williams Animal Shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| does for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| And what I was just looking at is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| is the county's portion's interest being served by being able to always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| bring any dogs, cats, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| from Knox County Animal Control to your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| I think there is no question that we are fulfilling that obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| It is not unusual for us periodically to have to go on emergency only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| simply because of the sheer volume of animals that are coming in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| And so there, like I go back, we have what we call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| what are best practices such as managed intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| So, for instance, owner surrenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| people who are looking to surrender their animal for a myriad of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| reasons, generally are not emergent issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| We have a waiting list for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| We have a pet resource center that those go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| And so from an animal control perspective, we have asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| and generally they oblige,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| but sometimes they do not bring in owner surrenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| And so, again, that's the best practice that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| But when it comes to animals that are a threat to the public health and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| absolutely hence that would constitute an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| And then I just have one other question then for Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| and then I'll be finished or I can, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| Do we have an agreement with any facility in Knox County for equine services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6611)|
| 1:50:21| or animal control because they've had, oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| There is another nonprofit called Horse Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| So generally when equine do come in, they have been generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| I don't know if they, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| I don't know if they have a formal contract with the city and the county to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| bring, but that has generally been the arrangement over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| although we would certainly be prepared to if something should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| Commissioner Lee, do you recognize me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| Yes, I had a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| I was a little shocked at the million dollars that the county is providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| Could you tell me, do you all get grants from anywhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| Do you have any other funding besides what the city and county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| Well, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| So our expense budget is $6.4 million, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| the city and the county only funds roughly a third of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| So our other revenue comes from revenue streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| be it our public spay-neuter, our adoption fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| various other fees that we receive, in addition to grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| donations from the private sector, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| And I didn't see any figures like, do you have the figures for like what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| admin, the cost of what you're spending for admin and employee salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| I mean, I do have, I don't have it with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| but I do have personnel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| We are funded for 99 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| and currently have roughly 90 employees on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| You don't have a figure for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I mean, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6726)|
| 1:52:15| I can certainly get it to you if I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6735)|
| 1:52:22| Can I jump in and ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Sure, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Is that in your quarterly report that Mr. Caldwell forwarded to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Would that be included in there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| The personnel budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| It's a portion of it, because based on the contract for services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| I mean, there's definitely personnel in there which aligns with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6757)|
| 1:52:44| particular scope of services, such as sheltering, which is feeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| and cleaning, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| So we do have a breakdown roughly or how we figure that is roughly two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| employees take 15 minutes to clean a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| Now that said, I would say you're getting a bargain at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| But we can get a figure for what you're spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| I can certainly give you our personnel budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| Commissioner Jay, you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Ms. Tusserman, when I was reading the contract under the scope of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| I mean, this may have been a contract that's been used over and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| but it's the first contract I've seen with a direct service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| that didn't have a lot of specifics of what you were required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| and not required to do and any penalties on service or specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| Has that ever been part of the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| And I sort of get to the, as that's referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| with Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| I actually reached out to her own animal control who told me that KCSO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| our sheriff's office, and KPD and the public were sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| we're all informed to put on emergencies only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| but this is the 20th time in the last 64 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| And although I certainly understand the seasonal aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| I guess I'm wondering, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| if city and the county are a third of the budget and the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| do they not get some sort of priority first before every other animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| I mean, we have a direct service line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| yet there doesn't seem to be any penalty to just go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| sorry, we can't take any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| And so I go back to as far as emergency only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| and I would confirm that with my directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| The number I've gotten is roughly 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| so that we've gone on emergency only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| which generally usually lasts maybe 24 hours, maybe 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| And, again, that goes back to kennel space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| So, you know, it is working with both city and county to help work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6891)|
| 1:55:01| when it comes to bringing animals in because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| there are a lot of animals that come in that aren't necessarily emergent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| and that can't wait to come in, such as owner surrenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| And so with that, yes, do we have other strays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| or Good Samaritans bringing dogs in simultaneously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| So we are daily trying to manage space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| We do make emergency calls for fosters from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| but we're not going to euthanize for space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| And so it's really working, ideally collaboratively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| to determine the urgency of an animal coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| which isn't always necessarily aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| And can you help us better understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| I imagine there was a time where the city had their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| sort of animal control facility, and maybe the county did too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| and at some point did they sort of get out of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| and contract with an independent third party to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| So, yes, we were the city of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| animal shelter for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| And then Young-Williams Animal Center came to be in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| We were still a government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| And then in 2012, we became a 501c3 that became the municipal shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| and took municipal contracts for the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| for sheltering services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| Commissioner Ward, do you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| Councilwoman Testament, I just want to say thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Your organization plays a really vital role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I'm very proud to have you in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| You and I have worked together the last two years very well together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| and I just wanted to say thank you for you and your 100-person staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| and everything that they do on a daily basis to handle such a huge influx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| I can't imagine juggling 11,000 animals is an easy task to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| I have a hard time juggling my one dog some days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| So I just wanted to say thank you and appreciate your service to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| and appreciate you being in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| I appreciate that very much. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| I will pass that to my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you, Councilwoman Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| The motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| Page 9, item number 50, resolution 804,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| is approving a community television agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| with Community Television of Knoxville Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| doing business as Knoxville Community Media, CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| to operate the access cable channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| for public, educational, and governmental access programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| There's a motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| to move forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| I pulled this for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| just because the contract with Community Television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| wasn't maybe as exact as we might want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| Knox County allocates $335,300 a year to Community Television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7105)|
| 1:58:35| and what I'd like to see is in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| we spell out the eight meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| that we would require them to broadcast for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| and that would be Commission, Work Session, Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| the Reorganization Meeting, Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| Ethics Committee, Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| and, of course, the Merit System Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| That would not include, like, Knox Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| but I just think on that contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| we should actually spell out what we want them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| for the $335,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| So I'll look to my colleagues for any suggestions, comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7150)|
| 1:59:19| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| I think if we delved into, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| that we should be careful not to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| to sort of narrow the focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| because we also call on them to do special committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| special workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| I don't think there's ever a time that we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| that they don't show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| and I fear if we got too specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| then at some point they may go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| well, sorry, if you want us to come to extra meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| beyond that, then it's going to be this price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| and that price and the other price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| So I actually might take the other approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| of making it more general and having a contract of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| and say we, for this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| we require that you cover all of our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| that are asked upon the request of the Chair and the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| because I really do think they go so much further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| than the specifics of where we are even today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| Commissioners, Mr. Oaks is here from CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| If you wouldn't mind to approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| Jason Amos Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| 2905 Bellevue Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| Mr. Oaks, what are your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| on specifying the specific meetings in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| versus leaving it vague?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Yeah, I think the contract indicates that we'll do commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| and then anything else that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| as long as we've got staff to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| I think that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| Do you have the exact language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| It's something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| That's what I was kind of worried about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| that we're only guaranteed one meeting for the $335,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| Yeah, and I guess to Commissioner Jay's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| it could potentially get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| where we would need to negotiate more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| because right now we've got one person, Justin, up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| That's our only production staff person right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| We had two... Katie just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| We are replacing her this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| but we've always had big turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| I've been there since 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I'm one of the few who have stayed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| and eventually landed to the position of director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| but it's not really a career job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| It's something that people usually come to right out of college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| and then they jump off to Red Arrow Productions or Jupiter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| or something else like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| It's been difficult to keep people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| and I think a lot of that has to do with what we pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| We do try to pay pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| and we do have an incredible benefits package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| But, yeah, like Mr. Jay said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| we try to cover everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| and even reach out often when we see a meeting on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| We'll call and say, hey, do you want us to cover this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| So we do our best to do everything we can for you, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| But, yeah, it does get tough sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| and then there are conflicting meetings with the city from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7344)|
| 2:02:30| And I will read into the record the specific language in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| regarding covering county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| It says, CTV shall produce an air, live, and tape delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| All regularly scheduled Knox County Commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| CTV shall also produce an air, live, and tape delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| Such number of commission workshops and other meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| as time and funds allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| So that's the language in the contract currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| What percentage of your overall budget, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| is the Knox County funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| Half, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| And where are your other major funding sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| So it's basically the two entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Yeah, we're working on a lot of grants right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| and doing a big fundraiser right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| So knoxcm.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| You can plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| We are having a big event on October 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| so you should check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| It's going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| But, yeah, we're looking for ways to get more funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| because we're trying to expand our mission and our vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| in the community right now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Well, I think your work is incredibly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| for the ability for the public to be open and honest with their government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| and for their government to reciprocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| Your partnership is crucial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| and you have always come with a yes, we'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| And I think we ought to do everything we can to support you and then some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| Do you know what your viewership is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| Has anybody ever tried to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| Because I cut the cord a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| So the only way I can watch it is through the wireless, fortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| I wish that our cable companies would provide CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| and the over-the-broadcast networks as free, basically, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7466)|
| 2:04:33| but that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| But have you ever, do you really know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| Because I think, didn't you one time, you say you were looking at a model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| and you tried to sell a little bit of advertisement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| Well, that's one thing we're thinking about doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| is underwriting for our programming, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| But we've never done Nielsen ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| It's been an expensive thing, something we can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| A lot of people don't know who we are, but when we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| have you ever watched a city council or county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| they always say, oh, you're that channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| So we know a lot of people watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| You can look at archive.org, where we archive all of your meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| and see the number of hits that people watch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| But I just returned from the conference in Chicago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| for the Alliance for Community Media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| and a lot of the public access stations across the country, like us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| are trying to keep their head above the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| and a lot of them are actually starting to do Nielsen ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| because it does matter to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| If you've got somebody who's coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| the public part of the tag access station thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| and they're doing a TV show, keeping them on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| if they knew how many people are watching the show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| it would help them continue to have the zeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| to produce programming for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| So, yeah, it's something that we need and want to do, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| I know that a couple of boards that I've sat on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| and still sit on some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| I appreciate the free advertisement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| you know, concert coming up, or fall festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| or come visit festival, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| So I do appreciate what you guys do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| and hopefully we will be able to help you out in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| Thank you, Mr. Oaks, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7586)|

| 2:06:34| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7594)|

| 2:06:39| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7601)|

| 2:06:52| Item number 54, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| It's approving the naming of Silmarin Roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7619)|

| 2:07:11| Motion to send forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| There's a motion to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| By Commissioner Hill, with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| I pulled this off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| I need to brag, as I probably don't do enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| on Jim Snowden and his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| On the naming of this roundabout, when I asked him about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| they really have gone above and beyond in a lot of areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| but I think especially in District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| we've got a lot of our farmland disappearing on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| and homes and apartments being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| and it's an attempt to try to preserve some of the legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| and remember what once was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| So I'm very, very grateful to your staff, Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| for the extra work that they put into this signage for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| The motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| Item number 55, Resolution 904,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| is to establish a personnel committee of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| Since this is mine, I will make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| Motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| I brought this, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| we have in the two years that I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| there have been boards and committees and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| that have been brought to our attention that the commission has purview over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| but may not have known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| and so all this merely does is create a committee of five commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| to have those chairs of those committees or boards report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| and just keep us updated of what is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| That's really all this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| I think this is long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| Some of our boards are not following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| That's why I keep saying raise your right hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| you follow the ordinance and you follow the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| This is long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| I'll fully support this and I'll throw my hat in the ring automatically right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| I'd like to be on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Quick question about this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| This would essentially be the oversight committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| I guess the question is what are the duties and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| and what's the teeth in this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| Because it's one thing to meet and kind of get informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| but what happens if things go awry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| Well, if there is an issue, since Merritt has been here on our agenda tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| we'll use it as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| If there is any kind of issue with that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| or if there's something that's needed to be approved with their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| anything of that nature can be brought to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| Then that committee can vote, much like we do with our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| and then it can come to full commission for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| You said boards and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| This would govern both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| Because in the case of the Merritt Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| if there's a board violation or an issue, it would go to ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| It wouldn't come to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| This more is dealing with the operations of the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| So the employees or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| I said employees, too, because it also includes the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| since the chair is the one that oversees the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| the chair of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| So they, too, would be reporting on anything that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| and if this committee deems necessary to bring any kind of issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| to full commission, then they could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| It's essentially to keep from a, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| not to just keep bringing up Merritt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| but to keep from having to call them to the full commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| to discuss any kind of issue that we may or may not have known about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| It's to be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| I just wanted to be clear, so I'm just reading the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7914)|
| 2:12:01| So whereas Knox County has supervisory authority and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| over various departments and agencies, including personnel committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7924)|
| 2:12:13| I just want to make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7933)|
| 2:12:21| Approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| Okay, so the duties of the personnel committee should be approved budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| requests and oversee the departments and agencies that the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| Commission has supervisory authority, including Merritt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| internal audit, commission office zoning appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| and other entity which has supervisory authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| So in essence, the Knox County Commission budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7959)|
| 2:12:47| which includes two employees and expenses to run this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| would actually, instead of going to the chair for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| it would go to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| No, it would still go to the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| and the chair would then report to this committee quarterly what has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| And so what if the chair, I'm just thinking of the scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| what if the chair says, here's what's going on and here's the budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| it's great, and this particular board says, we don't like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| we want to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| That's not really the purpose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| It's more when there comes, when the supervisor, or in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8001)|
| 2:13:27| in this example, would be the chair of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| if they came to the board with an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| then the committee could then decide if they wanted to take action or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| and then bring it to full commission if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| But, well, but it says in number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| the duties of the personnel shall be to approve budget requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| and oversee the departments and agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| So that means they have to, shall be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| They have to do that, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| And that would only be brought to this committee by the chair if the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| deemed it necessary to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| This is outside of any other kind of budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| Say the merit staff ran out of paper and they needed another small budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| request to buy more paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| It would then come to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| It wouldn't go to the board who governs it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| It would, and then they could bring it to this committee and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| in this last quarter, since our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| this necessity arose and here is where we are with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8067)|
| 2:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| I'm just trying to better understand sort of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| Just to clarify for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| my understanding was it was really more about personnel, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| the staff of these different offices and boards so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| a chair of some board couldn't just go rogue and fire an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| And we would have a measure of protection for the staff of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| merit system office or the staff of the commission or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| And it also is to be that check and to bring accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| Does this include internal audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| It is specifically in the language and not all are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| However, it does include that any other entity in which commission has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| supervisory authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| I'd like to offer a substitute motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| I'd just like to offer a substitute motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| I just want to make sure that we answer all the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| before we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| Substitute motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| Substitute motion by Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Let's discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| I second it, but I will be voting in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| I don't see any harm waiting until next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| Just to clarify, I, too, believe in the idea of what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| It seems a little confusing to me because I did think that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| originally put together because of the actual employees of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| but it sounds like the scope is much broader now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| and I just want to better understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| that we're not creating more layers of layers because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| in many of these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| the governing boards of those bodies make a lot of those decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| and if they have to then come to this and then go to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| it just seems to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| I just want to make sure I better understand it before next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| and I'm happy to sit down and talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| I'm just going to offer kind of a conciliatory suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| Would the maker of the original motion consider modifying it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| And perhaps the substitute motion might be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| So, in other words, if this is approved next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| next month on the agenda there will be five slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| and they will serve until August 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| and then this will be dealt with from there on out on September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| It will be for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| So, I amend my original motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8274)|

| 2:20:33| the criteria set forth in the commission-approved matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8433)|

| 2:20:43| As we evaluated this project, we had a couple of unique things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Sorry, lost my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| Typically, we do not usually look at commission as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| component of compensation when looking at these jobs with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8455)|

| 2:21:02| In this case, access compensation for these jobs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| heavily weighted toward commission since the vast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| majority of them will be in the sales and sales support areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| The average wage for these jobs is about $49,000 a year, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| is below our target county average annual pay of $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| When you, however, allow for the average commission, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| average annual pay jumps up to $117,000 plus a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| Since Axel has a proven history of their employees receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| significant commission compensation with less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8491)|

| 2:21:40| year, we decided to give them credit, if you will, for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| half of their annual commission payments and added that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| base salary of $49,000 for a total compensation amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| $83,250 per employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Using that number within the pilot matrix qualifies them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| 100% abatement for 12 years, which leads to the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| unique feature of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| We also wanted to take into account that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| investing this amount of money in an area that needs it within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| our county and the type of talent that they will attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| With that in mind, we thought it would be prudent to veer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| slightly from the matrix and instead offer them 100% abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| for 10 years, followed by a 50% abatement for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| By doing so, we were able to offer the company a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| more of an incentive, but at the same time, we ensure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| county starts receiving a return on its investment two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| earlier than it would be in the normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| This variation equates to an estimated higher abatement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| approximately $200,000 over the 15-year time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8562)|
| 2:22:46| Based on the economic impact analysis that we ran, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| 12-year incentive would result in a 2.4% rate of return and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| payback period of 9.8 years, while the 15-year abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| offers will result in 10.2% rate of return and a payback period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| of 10.3 years, so about half a year difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220919?start=8583)|
