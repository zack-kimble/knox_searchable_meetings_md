| 3:05:32| So I just wanted to clarify that, Mr. Collins, because it was not set at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11132)|
| 3:05:38| It's any range from 0 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| Thank you for letting me jump in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11141)|
| 3:05:44| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| Thank you, Commissioner, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| I just wanted to state when I ran for District 2 County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11150)|
| 3:05:55| the first time I got the opportunity to speak was always for development, good development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11155)|
| 3:06:03| any development that isn't going to cause concerns or problems for our neighboring neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11163)|
| 3:06:11| whatever district you lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| I am from the north part of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| and I know that we don't have any property like this to develop neighborhoods anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11178)|
| 3:06:26| And so I haven't heard the comment several times that young people don't want any yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11186)|
| 3:06:33| And I don't know, but up in northern Knoxville and Fountain City, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11193)|
| 3:06:39| We want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11199)|
| 3:06:40| And we have young people when homes go up for sale in Beverly Acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| north Knoxville, any of those areas, the young people are flocking to those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11204)|
| 3:06:51| because they like the bigger lots, the trees, and the scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11211)|
| 3:06:59| So I can count up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| If we had this property up toward our way, you would have no problem selling off two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11222)|
| 3:07:11| because there are people in Knoxville that would love to have acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11231)|
| 3:07:17| Also, I mean, one big concern, well, there were two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11237)|
| 3:07:21| When I went down to look at the property and to listen to both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| and try to make what I feel is the best decision for everyone involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11247)|
| 3:07:34| that keeps their interest in their property at a high level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11254)|
| 3:07:42| and Mr. Daniel, who is very fortunate to have this beautiful property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11262)|
| 3:07:49| I mean, it is absolutely beautiful property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| And I didn't even really realize it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| Anyway, I want to say that the schools, Knox County has already spent $65 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11278)|
| 3:08:05| to build two new middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11285)|
| 3:08:08| And West Knoxville is always being overcrowded at all of their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11288)|
| 3:08:16| So has anybody really checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11296)|
| 3:08:20| I mean, from what I've heard, you know, AL lots and West Valley Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11300)|
| 3:08:27| I mean, in terms of taking up the amount, the students that would move in to fill those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11307)|
| 3:08:36| are we creating another problem of having, you know, overcrowding for the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11316)|
| 3:08:43| that would be buying these homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| So that is a big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| And then another concern is, you know, is it 40 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11328)|
| 3:08:52| Is it 37 and a half acres or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| I mean, every half acre or every acre, I mean, it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11334)|
| 3:08:59| And, you know, I'm only speaking what I've been told and what I've studied and researched on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11339)|
| 3:09:07| Also, you know, that Mr. Daniel's house was for sale with five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11347)|
| 3:09:13| And so is, I mean, it seems to be still a lot of unanswered questions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11353)|
| 3:09:20| Is he going to stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| Is he going to sell it, you know, and move elsewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| Because I did speak to him on the phone, and he told me he wanted to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| So that answers the question that he is not planning on staying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11369)|
| 3:09:36| but that he still owns the house that his brother lives in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11376)|
| 3:09:40| So all of that, when you take the acreage away in terms of making, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11380)|
| 3:09:46| for this subdivision, that's some of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| And then the main road going in there, the homes that are on the right side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11389)|
| 3:09:56| as you're passing West Valley, Middle Squandale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| the homes on the right side there in another development that you get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11399)|
| 3:10:04| they sit right on the road now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| And so I've been told they are, you know, in terms of widening the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11407)|
| 3:10:12| they would be widening from the center over to the right side and the left side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11412)|
| 3:10:17| I don't see, if you move one foot toward those homes, the safety, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11417)|
| 3:10:24| you're pretty much on their deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| And so I have a big concern with the safety and just the people right there with their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11428)|
| 3:10:35| And then on the other side where you do have some of the sidewalk that is on the side of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11435)|
| 3:10:42| is that going to be built up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11442)|
| 3:10:44| Is there going to be curbs or is it just going to connect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11444)|
| 3:10:48| So, to me, there's a lot of uncertainty with the developer, with the owner, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11448)|
| 3:10:57| just what is going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| So the way it is right now, which is agriculture, where you could have one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| I mean one home per acre, is there a need to really change the zoning right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11464)|
| 3:11:13| And that's why I want to ask our commission and ask anybody else, is there that big a need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11473)|
| 3:11:19| And I cannot ignore all these neighbors and people that have come up here at 7 o'clock the week of Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11479)|
| 3:11:28| when I know they have lots of things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| So this states exactly how the community feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11491)|
| 3:11:38| Again, you know, I'm for, and they're not against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11498)|
| 3:11:41| I understand what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| Come up to North Knoxville, and you don't even have to, but look at Getty's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| I mean, they would more than welcome any of these subdivisions that have some property with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11509)|
| 3:11:57| And I think we need to make good use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11517)|
| 3:12:01| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| I've got a few, I guess, pragmatic clarification questions I'm going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11525)|
| 3:12:09| and whoever we think is the right person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| Some of these may be directed towards Mr. Green at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| I guess, Mr. Green, when we talk about adjacent zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11534)|
| 3:12:21| does MPC have a rule of thumb, guideline, or definition of adjacent zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11541)|
| 3:12:28| I know that one of the crux of the matters in this is compatible with adjacent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11548)|
| 3:12:33| So I just wanted to kind of get a clarification for the commission on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| at least from an MPC perspective, how adjacent zones are defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| Unfortunately, there is no set definition of adjacent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11561)|
| 3:12:45| We look at the general character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11565)|
| 3:12:49| And as I've stated briefly in my preface to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11569)|
| 3:12:54| that's one of the things that makes this challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| There is a variety of, as you go further, the character of the area is very varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11576)|
| 3:13:04| When we come in closer, the immediately abutting properties are larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11584)|
| 3:13:10| And so not having that set definition of adjacency makes it challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11590)|
| 3:13:16| challenging for staff, for the commission, and is still an issue with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| Okay. I've got one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| This may be better directed towards engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11603)|
| 3:13:26| One of the issues that has come up with this was around road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11606)|
| 3:13:31| And I think the proposed MPC recommendation was 20 feet. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11611)|
| 3:13:36| That's correct. And that came from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11616)|
| 3:13:39| Just to help me understand, can you all give me some –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11619)|
| 3:13:44| I've got some perspective, and I don't want to get hit by a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| so I haven't been out, like, measuring roads or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| But can you help me understand – can you give me some examples of some 20-foot roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11630)|
| 3:13:57| I mean, I live in the Bearden area, kind of right behind Baum Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11637)|
| 3:14:01| And I know my little neighborhood, my roads are real wide because we've got to park cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11641)|
| 3:14:06| But in terms of busy roads, just so I can understand apples to apples, this is proposed to be 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11646)|
| 3:14:12| Some roads that I would probably be familiar with, that might be 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| Okay. On George Williams itself in the two-lane section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11655)|
| 3:14:20| after you go through the hard S-curve where this is all at, it's about a 1.5-mile section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11660)|
| 3:14:27| It's 20 feet wide, and it carries about 2,900 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11667)|
| 3:14:34| Let's see, Nubbin Ridge Road, and that's about 2 ¾ miles in length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11674)|
| 3:14:40| and it is 20 feet wide, and it carries about 3,200 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11680)|
| 3:14:45| Moorfield Road is about 1 mile in length, and it's only 18 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11685)|
| 3:14:51| and it carries 2,100 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| There are stretches of Westland Drive that are 18 and 20 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11695)|
| 3:15:02| depending on which stretch you're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| but those are anywhere from 7,800 cars a day up to 9,400 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11705)|
| 3:15:12| I didn't need the car number, but I was just trying to connect in my brain the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11712)|
| 3:15:18| Thank you. I think that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11718)|
| 3:15:21| Another question I had, and this is more sidewalk-related, so it might even be you. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11721)|
| 3:15:26| One thing I noticed when I went out to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| you've got the school property, and the sidewalk has a curb, and it ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| As I understand, you go straight 150 yards or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11733)|
| 3:15:36| and the idea is to turn left into the entrance to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| What would be, either from a recommendation perspective, or if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| what kind of sidewalks are we talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11745)|
| 3:15:48| Because I know when I spoke with Mr. Collins one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11748)|
| 3:15:51| there's potential for inconsistent sidewalks if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11751)|
| 3:15:57| Would the sidewalks be consistent with where it terminates at the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11757)|
| 3:16:04| and starts at the entrance to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11764)|
| 3:16:08| Typically what we get for our sidewalk projects are a two-foot grass space behind the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11768)|
| 3:16:15| followed by a five-foot sidewalk width. That's our standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11775)|
| 3:16:20| I guess part of my question was, do they have curbs, no curbs, grass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| I would expect to see curbs as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11787)|
| 3:16:32| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11792)|
| 3:16:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| I've been trying to surf this area out through there to see the developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| but Mr. Green, this is addressed to you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11800)|
| 3:16:44| On these recommendations from the MPC, what conditions, again, could you repeat those for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11804)|
| 3:16:52| what goes with this kind of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| The conditions that were recommended by MPC were, one, lots that abut parcels 132-049.01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11816)|
| 3:17:05| and 132-049.12 must have an average lot size of one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11825)|
| 3:17:13| with no lot being less than .75 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11833)|
| 3:17:17| Condition number two, lots that abut parcels 132-050| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11837)|
| 3:17:23| and 132-050.02 must have an average lot size of .5 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11843)|
| 3:17:31| with no lot being less than .4 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| Condition number three, prior to approval of a final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| or issuance of any building permits for a development proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| a density of greater than one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11863)|
| 3:17:46| Millstone Lane must be improved to a minimum of 20 feet in width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11866)|
| 3:17:50| from the entrance of the development to the improved portion to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11870)|
| 3:17:54| and a five-foot wide sidewalk must be installed on the south side of Millstone Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11874)|
| 3:18:01| from the development entrance to the existing sidewalk to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11881)|
| 3:18:07| And what was the thought pattern behind these recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| I'll start with the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| The road widening was to accommodate the traffic that would be generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| by the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| The MPC projected that approximately 1,900 trips per day would be produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11900)|
| 3:18:28| or generated by the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| That road width would accommodate that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| The sidewalk would enable students and all others in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11913)|
| 3:18:38| to walk to West Valley Middle School and further along in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11918)|
| 3:18:44| The conditions with regard to the lot sizes was to provide some transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11924)|
| 3:18:49| from the larger lots above this property in those areas to the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11929)|
| 3:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11947)|
| 3:19:08| First question is Cindy or Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11948)|
| 3:19:12| In regards, I think some of the questions that we've seen on the e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| or discussions are dealing with the roadway and the drainage to the, I guess, the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11955)|
| 3:19:24| the residence to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| How would the road, would the road crown toward, how would we do the drainage on that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| I think that was one of the concerns that we haven't addressed yet, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11969)|
| 3:19:39| Hey, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| Yeah, Jim Snowden, Insuring Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11980)|
| 3:19:43| The design plan is a little unclear in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| It's hard to say exactly if it's going to be normal crown or shed one side to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11986)|
| 3:19:51| Those questions are usually answered more in the design plan phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| so I don't know if I can answer that question directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| Well, if the road is built to county specifications, would the drainage required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=11996)|
| 3:20:04| there would not be an allowed discharge of drainage onto other people's property, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12004)|
| 3:20:10| Or how would that affect, I guess, 538, 539 of Confederate Drive, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12010)|
| 3:20:18| They're the ones that are kind of the back, they're the north, the back north of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12018)|
| 3:20:23| And I guess some of the millstone properties that are facing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12023)|
| 3:20:27| Yeah, they're most likely, like you said, we would want typical crown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12027)|
| 3:20:31| so half the road would drain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| So yes, I mean, it would be allowed for additional widening for a little extra water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12033)|
| 3:20:38| to drain onto that person in the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12038)|
| 3:20:41| In the event that amount would become harmful or detrimental to that landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| then yes, we would acquire additional conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12045)|
| 3:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12049)|
| 3:20:50| My second question is for, I guess, Scott or Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12050)|
| 3:20:55| When we're talking about the proposed, and I don't guess any of us have seen the proposed green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12055)|
| 3:21:02| and I'm looking on the map at 9314, I think it's where the gentleman that spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| and I think that was kind of one of the lots where they talked about a larger lot beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12067)|
| 3:21:12| What kind of space are we talking about, and how would that green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12072)|
| 3:21:17| how would it go, the J, I guess, and what would the distance of that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12077)|
| 3:21:22| The two properties that back up to ours, that front millstone, the ones that would be most effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| that's where they had wanted to put one to three-quarter acre lots or whatever down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12088)|
| 3:21:34| What we would propose is to put a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12094)|
| 3:21:39| There's a lot of existing trees on those property boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12099)|
| 3:21:42| We would like to do a conservation easement so as those trees will not be disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12102)|
| 3:21:46| they will remain not only an area you couldn't build in, but they would be a visual and sound buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12106)|
| 3:21:52| In some of those places where there are not trees, we would propose that we would put evergreens in a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12112)|
| 3:21:59| a landscape buffer, and wrap these folks' homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12119)|
| 3:22:04| Okay. So a do-not-disturb on the trees that are currently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12124)|
| 3:22:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12128)|
| 3:22:09| And potentially more trees on the property line in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| Yeah, and the reason, one of the big reasons for that, I mean, and it gets back to why don't we build big lots there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12132)|
| 3:22:18| We don't build big lots there because nobody can afford them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| I mean, some people can, but not a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| I mean, the lots that these folks owned, they were $150,000 for a two-acre piece of ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12143)|
| 3:22:28| and most people simply can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12148)|
| 3:22:33| Those lots were also on existing roads, and when we develop roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12153)|
| 3:22:37| heck, it's $600 or $700 a lineal foot to develop property right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12157)|
| 3:22:42| and we just, it's not economically feasible at anything less than three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12162)|
| 3:22:47| So we try to maintain enough density to make the numbers work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12167)|
| 3:22:52| and that was kind of, if we did one-acre lots on one side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12172)|
| 3:22:57| and that would mean we'd have to do, I mean, little, super small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12177)|
| 3:23:02| not realistic lots on the other side of the road in a neighborhood, and it just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12182)|
| 3:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12189)|
| 3:23:10| We talked about adjacent, and there is a very, I can see where the MPC, looking at the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12190)|
| 3:23:19| I can see where the MPC was conflicted because you have, on Millstone, you have third-acre lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12199)|
| 3:23:28| and we brought up Getty's View, and I guess it's fair to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| but Getty's View is built on a plan residential one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12211)|
| 3:23:35| Am I seeing it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| And so it would be across the railroad tracks adjacent to a one to three as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12217)|
| 3:23:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| So is that where we're getting our adjacency from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12225)|
| 3:23:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12226)|
| 3:23:47| We tried to look at all the surrounding density, and not only that, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| we considered the proximity to a school and the desire for having higher density from a planning perspective closer to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12231)|
| 3:24:02| I guess really my only concern, or my main concern, not my only concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12242)|
| 3:24:06| but my main concern is the right-of-way discussion and whether or not that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| And I guess I'd like for Mr. Buch, if the law department has an opinion on where we are on that right-of-way discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12251)|
| 3:24:21| I have not looked at the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| I can tell you this from past experience, and I used to sit in the same chair that Arthur does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12264)|
| 3:24:31| that the engineers that do surveys start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| And when they certify a survey, they've gone back not to somebody else's property marker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12275)|
| 3:24:40| but they go back and they find some indicia of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| And I believe Ms. Pianchi established that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12285)|
| 3:24:49| and then some gentleman said that there was a plat of record which showed that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12289)|
| 3:24:56| If that is indeed a record, that's an indicia of the ownership of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12296)|
| 3:25:01| It's not just an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| And if that's what three surveyors came up with, then I would feel very comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12303)|
| 3:25:11| Commissioner Thomas, is that your line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12314)|
| 3:25:15| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| A couple of questions come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| Mr. Collins, so I'm completely clear, because there's only about, as I see from looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12319)|
| 3:25:28| on Millstone about five houses past Friel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12328)|
| 3:25:33| You represent most of the people in the Shady Mill subdivision, Statesview, or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12333)|
| 3:25:41| No, I represent the folks along Millstone Lane on the north and south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12341)|
| 3:25:45| the people on Friel's Lane, who are on that lower portion there that loops around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| the folks that are on Zola Lane, that's to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12350)|
| 3:25:56| There's several of those properties that are in the area, a couple of those abut up against the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12356)|
| 3:26:01| Folks along George Williams Road, some of those larger lots along George Williams Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12361)|
| 3:26:06| And then we have a representative here from Kevin Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| who's from the Statesview Subdivision Homeowners Association, who's here on their behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12370)|
| 3:26:15| representing about 200 lot owners who also oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| But they didn't want to drag all of them out here, so they sent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| I just wanted to be sure I was clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| I used to live on Tyrone, which is right up George Williams there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12384)|
| 3:26:27| On Friel's, because there's so many buildings here that you can't really tell from the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| how many actual residences, in fact, there's a couple of houses back here adjacent to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12392)|
| 3:26:38| I can't tell how they even get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12398)|
| 3:26:41| How many actual residences are on Friel's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| I think that's the point. They don't want you to find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12404)|
| 3:26:46| I believe six, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12406)|
| 3:26:52| On Friel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| Seven. Seven total down, it's kind of a holler down there, and there's seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12415)|
| 3:27:02| A couple of them are families who own large tracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12422)|
| 3:27:07| and they have multiple of their family members, you know, several generations that live on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12427)|
| 3:27:15| But I think there are probably seven homes, six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12438)|
| 3:27:24| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| Scott, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12448)|
| 3:27:33| The environmental or the conservative easements you're talking about, how wide are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12453)|
| 3:27:41| I can't. I could guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12461)|
| 3:27:46| Twenty to fifty feet, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| There's a tree line down through there, but I can't remember what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12469)|
| 3:27:54| We haven't finished a concept plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| I mean, we've done preliminary ones, but that's about what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12476)|
| 3:28:02| I know the property that's far, I guess, to the southwest, which is wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12482)|
| 3:28:10| The house is wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| There's a home there, and then I think Ural's property is the next piece of property that's got a lot of trees on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12492)|
| 3:28:18| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12498)|
| 3:28:19| If you're coming from the traffic light there at Millstone where it starts and you drive down Millstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12499)|
| 3:28:24| Friel's is on your left, heading west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| Are you talking, I mean, the woods, the farther down that property west you go, the more woods there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12507)|
| 3:28:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| How much of that wooded area do you own down at that far end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12514)|
| 3:28:37| Well, we only touch Millstone Lane at the very intersection of Friel's for about 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12517)|
| 3:28:44| So that's where our entrants can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| And we don't, I mean, most of what we're buying is a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12526)|
| 3:28:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12533)|
| 3:28:54| So that property butts up to the ladies at the wooded property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| My concern is that, you know, MPC has put a restriction on a one acre at the top left-hand portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12538)|
| 3:29:05| That would be on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12545)|
| 3:29:06| What about the buffer around these other people there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| Don't they deserve some type of buffer, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| I don't know who else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12551)|
| 3:29:14| They're looking here at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12554)|
| 3:29:15| I don't have the addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12555)|
| 3:29:18| The only people that we affect as we come in that directly adjoin us would be the two properties Mr. Daniels owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12558)|
| 3:29:25| And then I believe there are three houses that front Millstone that would be on the south side of Millstone that we would adjoin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12565)|
| 3:29:34| And those are two to five acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12574)|
| 3:29:37| And there is a wooded section of trees that kind of wraps those property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12577)|
| 3:29:45| And there's a little place in one or two of those lots where there aren't significant trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12585)|
| 3:29:51| and we plan on putting trees on our side of the line in if they wanted us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| But beyond there, it's pretty thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| It's pretty wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12598)|
| 3:30:02| Well, I've got the aerial map up, and it shows the blue building that Mr. Daniels talked about that would be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12602)|
| 3:30:12| That property goes on past that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12612)|
| 3:30:14| The property of Mr. Daniels currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| Yes, just a little ways past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| It goes up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| It's found on the south by the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| And it goes up to some two to five acre tracks that front Friel's and then part of his wraps back up to Friel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12623)|
| 3:30:33| If Millstone was extended, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| I'm sorry, to Millstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12635)|
| 3:30:36| I'm sorry, I'm getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12636)|
| 3:30:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12637)|
| 3:30:38| So it would connect to Millstone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12638)|
| 3:30:40| Solid woods, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| So all those woods are probably going to disappear more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12642)|
| 3:30:46| I got a question, I guess, for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12646)|
| 3:30:51| I know we're here on zoning, but if we was to pass any type of zoning tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12651)|
| 3:30:56| and it goes to court and it finds out that Mr. Collins is correct, that there's not enough right away or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12656)|
| 3:31:03| how will that affect our decision on the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| Will the zoning always be there or will it divert back to the agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12665)|
| 3:31:11| Well, as Mr. Seymour pointed out, if there's an issue on the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12671)|
| 3:31:19| that's a property issue and not subject to zoning, which you're going to do here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12679)|
| 3:31:24| I think you have to look at the condition that MPC put on it so that if it were to go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12684)|
| 3:31:32| and three surveyors were proved to be wrong, then it came back here and one of those conditions would not be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12692)|
| 3:31:40| That's the way I kind of look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12702)|
| 3:31:43| The condition that requires the roadway to be widened prior to the issuance of any building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12703)|
| 3:31:51| or approval of the final plant would come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12711)|
| 3:31:55| If the road could not be widened to 20 feet and the sidewalk constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12715)|
| 3:31:59| then basically it would be limited to one acre minimum lot sizes on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12719)|
| 3:32:05| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| One of the things about that is that a significant number of rezonings and plans that we hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12727)|
| 3:32:13| that you guys hear all the time, pretty commonly have the requirement to widen the road if it doesn't meet the specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12733)|
| 3:32:20| So that's not super unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12740)|
| 3:32:26| Ma'am, give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12746)|
| 3:32:28| Jessica Cazillo, 829 Frills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12748)|
| 3:32:31| Again, your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12751)|
| 3:32:32| Jessica Cazillo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| Was it Commissioner Daley who was asking about the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12756)|
| 3:32:38| My house is the one that's next to Mr. Daniel's house that's purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12758)|
| 3:32:42| and that's between the railroad tracks and his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12762)|
| 3:32:45| And our woods go back to about the front part of his barn that's currently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12765)|
| 3:32:52| The original plan they submitted, which I guess they're going to be creating a new one now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12772)|
| 3:32:57| original plan that they submitted because of how our property line kind of comes in at an angle next to Eddie's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12777)|
| 3:33:02| because Eddie's house had a very large retention pond that would be right off of our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12782)|
| 3:33:11| And so we do have a pretty large backyard, but our property line comes in at an angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12791)|
| 3:33:18| So if you can look, I don't know if it shows up on the map how much detail you have on KGIS or even Google Maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12798)|
| 3:33:25| but you can see a wooded play set that is right next to our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| That is actually not our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12809)|
| 3:33:31| That is his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| From a heart issue, I would ask that you guys not forget that Scott Smith said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12813)|
| 3:33:39| anything lower than three acres per unit does not make it financially worth it to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12819)|
| 3:33:44| and that there's a whole community of people here whose question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12824)|
| 3:33:48| does it have to be his gain in order for it to be our loss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12828)|
| 3:33:52| Or can there be something that's worked out to where everyone is happy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| Being at the last two NPC meetings, which I've never been exposed to, I have learned a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12836)|
| 3:34:02| It's actually been incredibly enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12842)|
| 3:34:04| It's made me care a lot more about the structuring of our entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12844)|
| 3:34:09| There seems to have been a lot of communication between the developer and the community in other instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12849)|
| 3:34:16| and we have not had that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| So we have not had any kind of meetings where we can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12859)|
| 3:34:25| There's been a very great divide, and that's obviously, for obvious reasons, very troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12865)|
| 3:34:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12872)|
| 3:34:37| Can I just refute that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| I met, first of all, with Mr. Gibson at his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12879)|
| 3:34:43| Eric and I went over there and had coffee, and we have talked to these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12883)|
| 3:34:47| and we have had another meeting, I think, in their attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12887)|
| 3:34:51| We went up and have met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| I just don't want you guys thinking we've totally blown them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12893)|
| 3:35:01| Mike Campbell, 9318 Millstone Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12901)|
| 3:35:07| I'd just like to say we did meet with the developer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12907)|
| 3:35:11| It was a very short meeting when he told us that there was no negotiation on the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12911)|
| 3:35:16| which has been one of our main points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12916)|
| 3:35:20| As Ms. Kudzo pointed out, and as our attorneys pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| we are not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| We are for right development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| And if he cannot afford the development except the one that he is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12929)|
| 3:35:35| then maybe it is not the right development for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12935)|
| 3:35:38| We have searched and spoken with three other developers who could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12938)|
| 3:35:45| be interested in developing this property at one and a half to two houses per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12945)|
| 3:35:50| with the buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| So I ask you tonight is that his financial plan, his development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12952)|
| 3:35:59| that is what they wish to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| But if it's not correct for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| it doesn't mean that this property will never be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| It's just not the right development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12966)|
| 3:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12968)|
| 3:36:09| One more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| One more speaker right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| James Gorney, 9322 Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12973)|
| 3:36:16| I want to thank you all for very careful consideration today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12976)|
| 3:36:20| I want to speak to just one issue very briefly, and that's the issue about the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12980)|
| 3:36:25| It seems to me there's a misconception here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12985)|
| 3:36:31| This is currently a small dead-end country road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| Even if it's widened two feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12995)|
| 3:36:39| it will not deal with what's going on right now even without the extra 1,900 car trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=12999)|
| 3:36:45| that would result from this kind of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13005)|
| 3:36:48| And that is twice a day during the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13008)|
| 3:36:51| there is a colossal bottleneck of cars going in and out of West Valley Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13011)|
| 3:36:57| that makes the whole area impassable for about half an hour twice a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13017)|
| 3:37:03| If you widen the road very slightly and put 1,900 more car trips into that per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13023)|
| 3:37:11| a bunch of them occurring during the exiting and entry of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13031)|
| 3:37:16| it's going to make what is currently a terrible bottleneck into a completely impassable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13036)|
| 3:37:23| So I would like the commission to consider that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13043)|
| 3:37:27| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13047)|
| 3:37:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13052)|
| 3:37:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13054)|
| 3:37:35| I did want to clarify one thing prior to making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13055)|
| 3:37:41| The documents that I saw were deeds that dated back to 1905,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13061)|
| 3:37:48| not just 30 years ago, that showed there was a discrepancy with the right-of-way issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13068)|
| 3:37:54| that there were two strips of land that was never dedicated to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13074)|
| 3:37:58| So I didn't want people to understand it was only something that they said was 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13078)|
| 3:38:04| They've gone back and done their due diligence all the way back to 1905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13084)|
| 3:38:09| If there's no other discussion, I'm prepared to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13089)|
| 3:38:14| I've got one minute of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| I've heard some mention of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| Sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13099)|
| 3:38:20| I've done that about three times today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13100)|
| 3:38:22| I've heard some discussion of substituting the large lots with some sort of buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13102)|
| 3:38:28| Is that something that we'd want to consider adding in, or do we want to leave this motion as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13108)|
| 3:38:34| Once his motion is made, we will discuss, we will deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13114)|
| 3:38:39| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13119)|
| 3:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13120)|
| 3:38:42| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion regarding the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13122)|
| 3:38:47| Since the MPC said from zero to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13127)|
| 3:38:52| and since two of the adjoining subdivisions, being Getty's View and State's View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13132)|
| 3:38:57| that are billed out at 1.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| I'd like to make a motion that we approve rezoning from agricultural to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13140)|
| 3:39:07| at a density of up to 1.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13147)|
| 3:39:12| with the three conditions that were stipulated by the MPC staff and commissioners who voted on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13152)|
| 3:39:19| and also that Millstone Lane, the road surface, be improved to the same standards as they're currently specked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13159)|
| 3:39:29| with the road width, the apron, the curb and the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13169)|
| 3:39:36| And since this is in the school responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13176)|
| 3:39:39| I think the curb needs to be there to keep those children who are going to be walking on that sidewalk safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13179)|
| 3:39:45| And I noticed that in our discussion that Engineering and Public Works acknowledged the need for the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13185)|
| 3:39:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13196)|
| 3:40:05| Okay, we have before us a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| Getty's View is developed out of 1.5 units to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| It is zoned one to three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13216)|
| 3:40:18| and taken into that density is the golf course land that's designated as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13218)|
| 3:40:24| I'm not sure that's a right comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13224)|
| 3:40:26| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13226)|
| 3:40:27| What about State's View?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13227)|
| 3:40:32| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13232)|
| 3:40:34| What was the other, other than Getty's View, what was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13234)|
| 3:40:36| State's View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13236)|
| 3:40:37| Is that the one that's directly on the other side of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| It's the one across George Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| Across George Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13241)|
| 3:40:47| Keep in mind most of these homes in this area are one home for every five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13247)|
| 3:40:54| Seven of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13254)|
| 3:40:56| More than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13256)|
| 3:40:57| Most of the homes are stacked on top of each other down the street at the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13257)|
| 3:41:00| Now when you conclude to the west Zola Lane, some of those are on one home for every seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13260)|
| 3:41:08| If you'll give me a second just to pull the map back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13268)|
| 3:41:10| I want to look at some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13270)|
| 3:41:11| I think that's a, because the owner of the, if you make that motion and the owner of the property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13271)|
| 3:41:22| again, you can't, we can't force that zoning on the owner if he doesn't want that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13282)|
| 3:41:26| So let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13286)|
| 3:41:28| The planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| The 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| If he doesn't want the 1.5, you can't force that on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13291)|
| 3:41:34| Well, the MPC gave us the recommendation of up to three dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13294)|
| 3:41:39| So what I did is I picked the middle point of 1.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13299)|
| 3:41:44| But the MPC also gave you up to three, which on a unanimous, not a questioned vote, a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13304)|
| 3:41:52| And so I think that the only question, I think, is if it's the sector plan, if it's the MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13312)|
| 3:42:05| he can, Arthur Seymour could go tomorrow if this is approved at 1.5 and get it overturned up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13325)|
| 3:42:12| because of there is no legal reason to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13332)|
| 3:42:17| And I think that's the, I think that's the legal format that Chancery Court would look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13337)|
| 3:42:23| is what is the legal reason to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13343)|
| 3:42:27| And I think if MPC has unanimously voted it fits the sector plan, what's the reason for turning it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13347)|
| 3:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13359)|
| 3:42:40| Are you stuck in your mind that they said that it has to be three units per acre from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13360)|
| 3:42:46| because that is not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13366)|
| 3:42:48| What's stuck in my mind is you're taking that three and making it 1.5 on your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13368)|
| 3:42:55| No, I'm taking half the distance from zero to three, which they said up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13375)|
| 3:43:01| So half of three is 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| So that's where I generated that figure based on what the community has asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13383)|
| 3:43:08| even though that is a much larger density than what currently is in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13388)|
| 3:43:15| One to three is right across the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13395)|
| 3:43:19| It's not built out at one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| You could put one to 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13403)|
| 3:43:24| Those are big lots and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13406)|
| 3:43:27| The question is not built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| The question is zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| And the question to the court is not built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| The question is zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13411)|
| 3:43:34| You yourself have been the most proponent of going to what the MPC has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13414)|
| 3:43:43| You're the one that had preached that to the whole commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| Explain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13426)|
| 3:43:48| Every time that there's a questionable zoning, you have said the professionals at MPC have recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13428)|
| 3:43:57| And I'm concerned about the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13437)|
| 3:44:00| I'm really concerned about the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| I don't think it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| And if it doesn't, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13443)|
| 3:44:06| But the question is, is this defensible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13446)|
| 3:44:11| If it fits the sector plan, if MPC has unanimously voted for it, is it defensible in Chancery Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13451)|
| 3:44:19| Minus the right-of-way, and I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13459)|
| 3:44:23| Okay, but again, I'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13463)|
| 3:44:26| So your opinion is that the MPC said three dwelling units per acre for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13466)|
| 3:44:33| Knocked it down from five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| Up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13475)|
| 3:44:36| Okay, so what does up to three mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| To me that doesn't mean three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13480)|
| 3:44:42| That means any portion up to three, you could make it 0.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13482)|
| 3:44:48| You could make it one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| But you're taking half of that away on your own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13491)|
| 3:44:54| Because that's what's consistent with other areas, other properties in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13494)|
| 3:45:00| These are large estate lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13500)|
| 3:45:02| Even the developer himself says he wants to carve out a one-and-a-half acre piece of property for his personal home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13502)|
| 3:45:09| He doesn't even want to be subjected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| Caddy Corner to this neighborhood is, it looks like, built out at three-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13511)|
| 3:45:18| Confederate and shady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| And they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13520)|
| 3:45:21| Built out at three-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| Almost 15 years ago, the community came together and agreed that that housing needed to be there for that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13523)|
| 3:45:30| because it was located on George Williams Road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13530)|
| 3:45:35| But the community 15 years ago could have said, well, no, we need to be the same as Statesview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13535)|
| 3:45:41| And they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13541)|
| 3:45:42| So, in essence, because the community agreed to a larger development for condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13542)|
| 3:45:48| then now that's being thrown and held against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13548)|
| 3:45:51| These are not condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13551)|
| 3:45:52| These are homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13552)|
| 3:45:53| Well, I mean, they're, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| They're single detached dwellings on about a quarter to a third of a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13556)|
| 3:46:05| One of the things that's before us right now is a determination of what we should do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13565)|
| 3:46:13| and what do we use as the guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13573)|
| 3:46:18| Some couple hundred years ago, population wasn't too dense through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13578)|
| 3:46:28| And a lot more, several more people moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13588)|
| 3:46:34| And let me, you know, crash forward, speed forward for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13594)|
| 3:46:40| and say that sometime somewhere in the 50s, in the 1950s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13600)|
| 3:46:47| Knox County took upon itself by majority, I guess you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13607)|
| 3:46:55| to say we need to look at what we do and when we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13615)|
| 3:47:00| and how we try to put some order to the chaos that we've caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13620)|
| 3:47:06| by all these muddy roads that we've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13626)|
| 3:47:12| Now, I can see a little bit of the long time that I've been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13632)|
| 3:47:22| begin to come in play for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13642)|
| 3:47:28| I've seen a lot of months dedicated to looking at billboards, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13648)|
| 3:47:36| or I'm trying to think, slope and ridge, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13656)|
| 3:47:42| We probably met on slope and ridge for three years to come up with a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13662)|
| 3:47:49| and a plan by which we could recognize steep terrain needs fewer residences per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13669)|
| 3:47:59| And also, I think that since I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| almost every sector plan of Knox County has been reviewed and changed and updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13683)|
| 3:48:13| One of those plans said that we could take large pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13693)|
| 3:48:22| and cluster development in a certain area and cover it with a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13702)|
| 3:48:30| The density would still remain the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13710)|
| 3:48:36| but all of the development would be closer together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| being less an impact on Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13719)|
| 3:48:46| I would have to admit, though, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13726)|
| 3:48:48| the one thing that I did miss in clustering of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13728)|
| 3:48:54| I don't remember that we went with a plan that said some acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13734)|
| 3:49:01| on the periphery of a development would be less dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13741)|
| 3:49:06| while as you move toward the center of the development, the density would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13746)|
| 3:49:14| That seems to be a new concept that I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13754)|
| 3:49:16| and I don't know how that fits into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13756)|
| 3:49:20| Because what we have before us is not really what we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13760)|
| 3:49:29| What we have before us is we should take the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13769)|
| 3:49:34| that's been worked on for many a decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13774)|
| 3:49:38| and apply that plan to the request of the property owner that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13778)|
| 3:49:51| Now, we've seemed to have got to a point where what's allowable, what the plan allows, is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13791)|
| 3:50:02| What the professional staff and our peer NPC committee has recommended is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13802)|
| 3:50:14| How do you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13814)|
| 3:50:16| Read that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13816)|
| 3:50:18| I read that. I can read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13818)|
| 3:50:22| We've already established that the head count doesn't change at going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13822)|
| 3:50:30| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| If it's three, it doesn't matter whether they're clustered into the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13832)|
| 3:50:37| And thin around the edges, it's still three to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13837)|
| 3:50:42| Now, you have to determine, is it 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13842)|
| 3:50:45| Is it 34?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| Is it 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| See, I've gotten lost in everyone's numbers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13852)|
| 3:50:56| And I believe what we've tried to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13856)|
| 3:51:05| take the plan that has been implemented in Knox County to be used as zoning guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13865)|
| 3:51:12| and turn that into a plan that we would like to see implemented on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13872)|
| 3:51:22| not recognizing that there is a plan that we should be following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13882)|
| 3:51:27| That's one of the reasons that we have the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13887)|
| 3:51:30| is to make sure that politics doesn't enter into the decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13890)|
| 3:51:36| as we go forward dealing with property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13896)|
| 3:51:40| because the person that owns the property is the one that we should be trying to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13900)|
| 3:51:47| Commissioner Anders, I'm sorry I walked on your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13907)|
| 3:51:50| I'd like to ask if we can, and I don't even know if this is feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13910)|
| 3:51:54| and I don't know if there's any desire to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13914)|
| 3:51:59| Mr. Seymour, has there been a, I'm trying to think of the name of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13919)|
| 3:52:06| submitted a subdivision plan or a plat submitted to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13926)|
| 3:52:12| There is a concept plan that has been submitted, but it's going to have to be revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13932)|
| 3:52:18| Would your client be, because I think there's too much contention to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13938)|
| 3:52:24| would your client be willing to, and I don't know if it's legal or possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13944)|
| 3:52:29| or if the timing works out, to let that process go through MPC before pending the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13949)|
| 3:52:35| and see if the zoning and the site plan and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13955)|
| 3:52:40| is that something that could be agreed upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| Just from a, and I'll answer, I'm going to interject my direction to my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13962)|
| 3:52:48| that accepting a concept plan prior to the rezoning sets the expectation from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13968)|
| 3:52:57| that that plan, that that rezoning will be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13977)|
| 3:53:00| and their perception on the part of the public that it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13980)|
| 3:53:04| And I have instructed my staff not to accept a concept plan before a rezoning is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13984)|
| 3:53:09| Because of that expectation, that building of expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13989)|
| 3:53:14| and that building of a perception that I think speaks bad to good government work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=13994)|
| 3:53:24| Well, I think, my desire is not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14004)|
| 3:53:27| My desire is for the community to have sight of the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14007)|
| 3:53:32| to make it, see if it's more palatable than we think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14012)|
| 3:53:35| And I'll have to look to our law director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14015)|
| 3:53:38| Because I know in the state of Tennessee, conditional zoning is not accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14018)|
| 3:53:43| And that would almost speak to conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14023)|
| 3:53:46| And I'll look to the legal department to answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14026)|
| 3:53:50| the more legal aspect of that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14030)|
| 3:53:53| I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| So is there a way, Arthur, to the community be presented with a site plan before it goes to MPCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14035)|
| 3:54:04| I don't know. I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14044)|
| 3:54:06| I know they can change, but I mean, it may not be as ugly as we think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14046)|
| 3:54:15| Do I understand you want us to submit what the site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14055)|
| 3:54:19| I want the community to have a look at, possibly look at, what the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14059)|
| 3:54:25| the proposed site plan, knowing it can change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| but what it may look like with the conservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14068)|
| 3:54:33| with your thoughts on where you want to place things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14073)|
| 3:54:36| I mean, I think a community meeting with that proposal, without going to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14076)|
| 3:54:44| maybe the community is more acceptable once they see it, if it's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| I don't know if it's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14088)|
| 3:54:49| I'm just trying to, because what we have is a community's desires against the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14089)|
| 3:54:56| that has already been voted on specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14096)|
| 3:54:59| I'm just trying to make it, see if it's more palatable than they think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14099)|
| 3:55:04| I don't see that as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14104)|
| 3:55:08| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we defer for January, if you all can have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14108)|
| 3:55:14| Or do you want, I don't, is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14114)|
| 3:55:17| Is that something that, and you have a community meeting with a proposed discussion about the plot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14117)|
| 3:55:25| I don't see that as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14125)|
| 3:55:27| I think Mr. Britton, I'm sorry, I forgot your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14127)|
| 3:55:32| Collins, Mr. Collins, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14134)|
| 3:55:36| We've already had an opportunity to see what the developer has in line for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14136)|
| 3:55:41| by virtue of the fact that they've already submitted a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14141)|
| 3:55:47| Granted, under a different zoning, the concept plan that they presented is at 3.4 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14147)|
| 3:55:54| and MPC has obviously recommended up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14154)|
| 3:56:00| So I don't think that we're going to see some massive shift in the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14160)|
| 3:56:06| as a result of a reduction of four-tenths of a dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14166)|
| 3:56:12| But I think that ultimately what exists is a fundamental difference in the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14172)|
| 3:56:21| and that's what it always comes back to, is the density and the harmonization of the requested density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14181)|
| 3:56:30| the recommended density levels versus what's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14190)|
| 3:56:35| and what's practical for this piece of property with the infrastructure constraints that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14195)|
| 3:56:41| So all they're doing by this conservation easement is just affecting sight lines, which isn't the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14201)|
| 3:56:49| It's never been the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14209)|
| 3:56:52| I don't want you to think I don't understand what your intention is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14212)|
| 3:56:56| and I appreciate you trying to find some way for us all to resolve this, but we've had those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14216)|
| 3:57:04| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14224)|
| 3:57:05| We've had meetings, and there just seems to be a fundamental disagreement between the two sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14225)|
| 3:57:10| about what's appropriate for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14230)|
| 3:57:13| And I don't know that them presenting a concept plan that's going to have 20 less houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14233)|
| 3:57:18| and basically 20 additional feet of setback on the rear of some property lines is going to resolve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14238)|
| 3:57:26| And, you know, if you want us to have the meeting, we'll have the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14246)|
| 3:57:31| but I think ultimately it would prove fruitless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14251)|
| 3:57:35| Is there a second on that substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14255)|
| 3:57:42| Nobody? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14262)|
| 3:57:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14268)|
| 3:57:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14270)|
| 3:57:56| There is a time that communities can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| and they can try to determine where they fit in the sector plan, and that's in the sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14279)|
| 3:58:05| And I'm assuming that this zoning is not against the sector plan, that it fits the call for the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14285)|
| 3:58:15| The zoning does fit within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| The sector plan designates this as LDR, low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14297)|
| 3:58:21| which is a density from one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14301)|
| 3:58:25| It does not establish a set density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14305)|
| 3:58:29| It provides for a range of densities from one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14309)|
| 3:58:34| And the zoning is the issue we're supposed to be looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14314)|
| 3:58:39| I'll go back to Sam McKenzie and try to remind everybody up here to stay in our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14319)|
| 3:58:46| We're here for a zoning issue only, not a use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14326)|
| 3:58:50| If the road is not wide enough to be built to the specs required by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14330)|
| 3:58:56| then the zoning is a mute point from what I understand from everybody that's testified to that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14336)|
| 3:59:04| The MPC staff professionals looked at this, Mr. Green, and they recommended three units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14344)|
| 3:59:13| That's up to three units per acre, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14353)|
| 3:59:20| The MPC commission looked at it and voted 14-0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14360)|
| 3:59:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14365)|
| 3:59:27| In your opinion, and we hear a lot about the developments around this, what is the anomaly here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14367)|
| 3:59:34| Is it the two to five acre tracks or the up to three units an acre developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14374)|
| 3:59:42| Given the character of the larger area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14382)|
| 3:59:45| I think Mr. Collins identified it correctly by calling this a micro neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14385)|
| 3:59:51| That's unique in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14391)|
| 3:59:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14394)|
| 3:59:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14396)|
| 3:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14399)|
| 4:00:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14400)|
| 4:00:01| One thing I wanted to clarify, and I just wanted to ask Chairman Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14401)|
| 4:00:09| when he said that our responsibility was to represent the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14409)|
| 4:00:17| you were referring to Mr. Daniel, the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14417)|
| 4:00:22| The applicant, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14422)|
| 4:00:24| Well, I just want to clarify that what about all the rest, what about everybody else, their property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14424)|
| 4:00:34| and we as commissioners are supposed to represent all of the citizens in Knox County, and I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14434)|
| 4:00:46| We're not here just to represent one particular property owner, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14446)|
| 4:00:54| We're here to make the best decision for every property owner in Knox County wherever and whatever district you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14454)|
| 4:01:03| So I just wanted to, you really meant that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14463)|
| 4:01:06| Is that really what you meant or you just said it kind of differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14466)|
| 4:01:10| So I wanted to clarify, I'm here to represent Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14470)|
| 4:01:13| I'm here to represent every single one of you all out there in whatever area in Knox County that you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14473)|
| 4:01:19| So you're all's concerns and Mr. Daniel's concerns, and I'm about government looking out for the safety of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14479)|
| 4:01:30| That's our job, is not to tell you all what to do or how to do, but it's to protect you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14490)|
| 4:01:38| So I'm here to protect Mr. Daniel's investment, and I'm also here to protect you all's investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14498)|
| 4:01:45| So with that being said, and I don't know, we've been to whatever anyway, I kind of, and I don't know, I mean, I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14505)|
| 4:01:54| I don't know all the, everything that all these men know and everybody on BZA and MPC and all that, but I'm always in the process of learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14514)|
| 4:02:03| So my big thing is the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14523)|
| 4:02:07| There seems to be a huge difference in who has the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14527)|
| 4:02:13| So we do this, and the county assumes, okay, we have this right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14533)|
| 4:02:18| What's to stop the other homeowners from taking, going to court and saying, no, that's not the county's right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14538)|
| 4:02:26| There's not been a specific answer to who owns what in terms of right of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14546)|
| 4:02:33| So we could sit up here and we could rezone and we could do whatever, but if the right of way is not there to be able to do it, it's a mute point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14553)|
| 4:02:44| So my motion or whatever would be that, you know, how are we going to clarify the right of way, regardless of what we do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14564)|
| 4:02:59| That's the number one big step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14579)|
| 4:03:01| So where do you go from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| I mean, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14583)|
| 4:03:04| I mean, we could zone it, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14584)|
| 4:03:07| We can keep it agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14587)|
| 4:03:09| I mean, if there's not a right of way there, who's going to be, who has the authority to override that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14589)|
| 4:03:18| Go to court and let the judge decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14598)|
| 4:03:21| So there we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14601)|
| 4:03:25| So, I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14605)|
| 4:03:30| Can I answer that with my limited knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14610)|
| 4:03:35| And it is up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14615)|
| 4:03:40| Can you yield to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14620)|
| 4:03:42| I will yield to Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14622)|
| 4:03:49| If I understand this correctly, if we go forward with the rezoning decision, okay, then they cannot go forward without breaking ground until they determine whether they have the right of way issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14629)|
| 4:04:05| I don't think that we need to stop the rezoning until that is actually resolved, because that's not part of the rezoning application that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14645)|
| 4:04:15| But one way or the other, they can't break ground until they figure out if they're going to be able to put that development in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14655)|
| 4:04:21| because currently they can't do more than one home per acre based on the current size of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14661)|
| 4:04:29| So is there really a need to rezone it tonight or keep it agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14669)|
| 4:04:38| The road situation is not before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14678)|
| 4:04:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14682)|
| 4:04:43| That's one of the complexities of this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14683)|
| 4:04:46| So we can either rezone it or we can keep it at agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14686)|
| 4:04:49| That's our two decisions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14689)|
| 4:04:52| We can either go with the motion on the floor or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14692)|
| 4:04:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14698)|
| 4:05:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14700)|
| 4:05:03| Mr. Daniels, how long have you lived in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14703)|
| 4:05:09| Been right at 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14711)|
| 4:05:16| I look at the property around this area and there's something right here that can be, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14716)|
| 4:05:23| that we didn't look at an unforeseen consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14723)|
| 4:05:26| Number one, the property around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14726)|
| 4:05:28| We've done this one time before a long time ago when I was on the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14728)|
| 4:05:32| where we went and limited the number of being developed on a certain road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14732)|
| 4:05:38| I think it was like the lot sizes were really large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14738)|
| 4:05:41| I think it was five to eight to ten acres per lot that we did that number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14741)|
| 4:05:49| And one of the first things I saw when I came back on commission was there was a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14749)|
| 4:05:54| that had bought one of those lots that wanted to come back in here and subdivide his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14754)|
| 4:05:59| so he could have a little bit better retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| If we go and say we limit it to one to five, or one to three, whatever, up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14761)|
| 4:06:09| Let's make sure I'm correct on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| Up to three, which I think is what the developer is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14772)|
| 4:06:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14778)|
| 4:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14779)|
| 4:06:20| Up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14780)|
| 4:06:23| And they can only get, because of the zoning and the plat plan, they can only get up to 1.5 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14783)|
| 4:06:34| But that still leaves the rest of the people that have those large pieces of property out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14794)|
| 4:06:40| an option ten to 15 years down the road that you can also subdivide yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14800)|
| 4:06:46| and use your property because you own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14806)|
| 4:06:49| Mr. Daniel owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14809)|
| 4:06:51| I don't think we have the right, if he's asked for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14811)|
| 4:06:54| and MPC has said this is what it should be by their regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14814)|
| 4:07:00| that we have a right to limit that person for the sale of his land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14820)|
| 4:07:06| and cause him a little bit of financial loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14826)|
| 4:07:11| That's not our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14831)|
| 4:07:13| I believe in property owners' rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14833)|
| 4:07:16| If he wants to accept it up to three, then that's not our job to decide if it's up to 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14836)|
| 4:07:27| I mean, how can we tell people what they can do with their land when we have an agency that says this is what he can do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14847)|
| 4:07:36| And that's just my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14856)|
| 4:07:38| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14858)|
| 4:07:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14860)|
| 4:07:41| That's what MPC did was told the property owner he wanted five so he gets three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14861)|
| 4:07:46| So somebody's telling somebody something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14866)|
| 4:07:49| To me, this piece of property, I don't think I can support 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14869)|
| 4:07:55| I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| But looking at two, if you look at the property all around it, it's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| This is a good opportunity to go two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14882)|
| 4:08:06| Then the people next door, their property can go one to three or one to four or one to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14886)|
| 4:08:13| and eventually it's going to touch these outer areas where you've got one to four RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14893)|
| 4:08:20| They don't tell you what that one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14900)|
| 4:08:22| It looks like it's nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14902)|
| 4:08:26| I think one of the commissioners brought up the one on Saddlebrook or whatever that or the condos or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14906)|
| 4:08:34| All that entrance is on the Georgia Light Road, looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14914)|
| 4:08:40| That road, Millstone Road, those houses are backed up on the right-of-way as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14920)|
| 4:08:47| I mean, it should have been that way in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14927)|
| 4:08:50| So I can see, you know, maybe going to two per acre but not one and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14930)|
| 4:08:56| because this is a good opportunity to protect a little bit of a neighborhood, have development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14936)|
| 4:09:02| Then the next property owners can ask for larger density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14942)|
| 4:09:06| It's closer to the one to fours and the one to fives and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14946)|
| 4:09:13| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14953)|
| 4:09:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14955)|
| 4:09:17| Procedurally, let me make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14959)|
| 4:09:21| We're in the middle of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14961)|
| 4:09:23| But I'm still confused on the motion that's on the floor to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14963)|
| 4:09:31| And the recommendation of MPC up to three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14971)|
| 4:09:36| So are we voting existingly on the motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14976)|
| 4:09:40| or is this a friendly amendment to try to clarify the language so that we can call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14980)|
| 4:09:46| The motion that is on the floor is for density of up to one and a half, not three to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14986)|
| 4:09:55| up to one and a half to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=14999)|
| 4:10:00| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15000)|
| 4:10:01| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15001)|
| 4:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15002)|
| 4:10:04| Commissioner Anders, I think, is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15004)|
| 4:10:06| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15006)|
| 4:10:07| I really want to talk about if this, before you announce the vote, whether it wins or fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15007)|
| 4:10:15| I think the property owner has, there's a consequence of this, if it fails, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15015)|
| 4:10:26| I guess the law director needs to answer what's going on here because, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15026)|
| 4:10:31| I don't want to, before you announce the vote, I don't want to force a zoning on a property owner that they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15031)|
| 4:10:36| because that can be long-term detrimental to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15036)|
| 4:10:42| And if it's not his desire, I don't want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15042)|
| 4:10:46| And number two, if it fails, so this is really, I guess it's not a negative motion, but if it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15046)|
| 4:10:53| can it be brought back up tonight in another motion or is it a dead issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15053)|
| 4:10:59| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| Two points, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15062)|
| 4:11:05| And Commissioner Anders, I want to go back to what you said earlier, and it ties in with what Mr. Green said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15065)|
| 4:11:13| You're looking at a sector plan that allows one to five planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15073)|
| 4:11:22| The planning commission has said one to three with conditions to protect everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15082)|
| 4:11:28| The sector plan says it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15088)|
| 4:11:30| It's a 14 to nothing vote by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15090)|
| 4:11:36| If this were to go to court, if it were to be denied the way it came from planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15096)|
| 4:11:42| there is a good chance, as you pointed out, Commissioner Anders, that it would be quickly overturned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15102)|
| 4:11:48| because it would be arbitrary, because you rely on the expertise of MPC, it's in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15108)|
| 4:11:57| and because people out there, and I respect their opinions, it's their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15117)|
| 4:12:03| but that cannot be the sole ground or the grounds for turning it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15123)|
| 4:12:09| So you were correct, Commissioner Anders, that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15129)|
| 4:12:12| The second thing is a procedural one, and the motion, if it were to be done tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15132)|
| 4:12:21| irrespective of whether it could be successfully sued upon, could it be brought up again, you're asking if Mr. Stewart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15141)|
| 4:12:31| If this motion fails, is it a dead issue, or is it at that point you can't do a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15151)|
| 4:12:42| Can I change my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15162)|
| 4:12:43| That's correct. You make an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15163)|
| 4:12:46| And if it's turned down, it can't do anything for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15166)|
| 4:12:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15170)|
| 4:12:51| And so, again, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| And then you're back in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15173)|
| 4:12:57| The maker of the motion wishes to amend his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15177)|
| 4:13:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15184)|
| 4:13:05| After heartfelt consideration and seeing the pleasure of some of my colleagues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15185)|
| 4:13:15| I'd like to amend my motion with two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15195)|
| 4:13:23| plus the three conditions stipulated by the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15203)|
| 4:13:29| and then the additional condition of that Millstone Lane have the same improvements with the same size road surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15209)|
| 4:13:40| as it is to the east with the apron, the curb, and the stormwater drainage and sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15220)|
| 4:13:53| If the second will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| You need to say that in the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15235)|
| 4:13:58| I'd like to restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15238)|
| 4:14:02| Is it two acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15242)|
| 4:14:03| It's two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| Two to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15245)|
| 4:14:06| With the carbon guttering road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15246)|
| 4:14:09| So I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15249)|
| 4:14:10| The second agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15250)|
| 4:14:11| Yes, she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15251)|
| 4:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15252)|
| 4:14:13| So now we're in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| And this is now an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15255)|
| 4:14:18| This is not a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15258)|
| 4:14:20| This is an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15260)|
| 4:14:25| Do I still have the floor, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15267)|
| 4:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15268)|
| 4:14:29| I'd like to reiterate the need for a possible 30-day postponement based on just the sheer fact that this has become an emotional decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15269)|
| 4:14:41| and not an administrative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| And I think if there's an opportunity to make progress between the developer and the community before we hamstring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15283)|
| 4:14:52| that's a proper term, the landowner with a zoning that we don't wish to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15292)|
| 4:15:02| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we delay and see if we can work something out through the community and the developer in the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15302)|
| 4:15:12| for the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15312)|
| 4:15:16| That's a substitute motion that needs a second if it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15316)|
| 4:15:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15320)|
| 4:15:25| We have a substitute motion before us, properly made and seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15325)|
| 4:15:30| to delay this administrative decision for 30 days pending talks between the applicant and the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15330)|
| 4:15:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15347)|
| 4:15:48| If that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15348)|
| 4:15:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15349)|
| 4:15:50| I'm just looking to see if that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15350)|
| 4:15:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15352)|
| 4:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15353)|
| 4:15:54| Now then the applicant, I need a response from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15354)|
| 4:15:57| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15357)|
| 4:15:58| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15358)|
| 4:15:59| No objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15359)|
| 4:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15360)|
| 4:16:01| There's no objection from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| We are now speaking only to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15363)|
| 4:16:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15366)|
| 4:16:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15367)|
| 4:16:08| Can I ask a question about procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15368)|
| 4:16:12| No substitute, additional substitute motion can be made at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15372)|
| 4:16:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15376)|
| 4:16:18| Once we vote on the first, on the substitute, can another substitute before we go to the original question be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15378)|
| 4:16:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15385)|
| 4:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15386)|
| 4:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15389)|
| 4:16:32| I'd also like to get some clarification from MPC around conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15392)|
| 4:16:37| When I watched the MPC meeting where this particular subject matter came up to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15397)|
| 4:16:43| one of the issues that Mr. Green mentioned is that moving forward in order to clarify expectations for developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15403)|
| 4:16:53| that these conditions and things similar to this that are relatively new, frankly, for this particular zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15413)|
| 4:17:01| are something that we should expect moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15421)|
| 4:17:04| That was something that was also, one of the MPC commissioners mentioned that in that particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15424)|
| 4:17:10| But if you could clarify some of the conditional statements in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15430)|
| 4:17:14| what we should expect moving forward and how that sort of applies to this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15434)|
| 4:17:22| Adding generalities to things that are decided case by case is difficult, but things we can look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15442)|
| 4:17:29| And this is to provide better direction to the developers, to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15449)|
| 4:17:33| and to the commissioners here and the MPC commissioners as they review use on review plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15453)|
| 4:17:40| Things addressing road improvements, sidewalks, possibly density, design in some commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15460)|
| 4:17:48| maybe even addressing design and landscaping, site planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15468)|
| 4:17:53| Those are the general types of conditions we'll be looking to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15473)|
| 4:17:58| and attach to rezonings when there are uses on review or plan review as part of the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15478)|
| 4:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15487)|
| 4:18:09| Commissioner Schoonmaker speaking to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15489)|
| 4:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15494)|
| 4:18:17| I think that the community has had meetings with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15497)|
| 4:18:22| The developer has stated their case of what they want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15502)|
| 4:18:27| The community has been dealing with this since July of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15507)|
| 4:18:32| and I think that they should receive a decision this evening from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15512)|
| 4:18:42| If I may, the applicants, if we could make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15522)|
| 4:18:46| Ladies and gentlemen, I've been dealing with this for over two years, trying to sell my property, the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15526)|
| 4:18:54| I have offered it to this group that's in opposition to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15534)|
| 4:18:59| I've told them, bring me a contract, I'll sell it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15539)|
| 4:19:03| I've told them I'd sell it with my house, without my house, any way they wanted to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15543)|
| 4:19:09| This gentleman here, when he bought his house, there had been a for sale sign on this property for over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15549)|
| 4:19:17| There's about an acre of raw land between the back of his house and where this subdivision will begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15557)|
| 4:19:27| I'll still be glad to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| I'll meet with them any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15569)|
| 4:19:32| Some of them, I've allowed them to come through and walk through my house, go through it, look at it, any time, my buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15572)|
| 4:19:43| I've tried, you know, I want to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15583)|
| 4:19:46| Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15586)|
| 4:19:49| We have before us a proper substitute motion that's agreed to, correct, Counselor Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15589)|
| 4:20:01| To have this reappear on our next zoning agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219?start=15601)|
