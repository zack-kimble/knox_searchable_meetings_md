| 0:00:30| Well, let me call this to order. Thank you for coming. I assume four or more of us will show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=30)|
| 0:00:40| Let's ask Lauren Ryder to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=40)|
| 0:00:50| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=50)|
| 0:01:05| Now, Angela, I assume you're ready to roll. If you could call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=65)|
| 0:01:15| Councilman Campa? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=75)|

| 0:01:31| Councilwoman Welch? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| Thank you. There are five of us here. That does constitute four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| Although, for those of you who have not been in workshops before, we cannot vote on anything, so that's almost a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=97)|
| 0:01:46| This, obviously, is regarding the development of the Supreme Court site tonight, and I will ask Bill Lyons to start us off, and then I'll let Bill turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=106)|
| 0:01:59| Oh, let me make another point. If you need the microphone, we have four microphones up here, but we are recording this on CTV, so if you speak very distinctly and fairly loud, you might be able to be recorded on this, and we would like this, hopefully, to be recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=119)|
| 0:02:17| Thanks. I appreciate everybody's coming, and this has been a project we've been working on for a very long time, through a number of iterations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| going back to what many of you know was the old State Supreme Court building, which has been vacant for a very long time, and sitting in a very important place for a very long time, standing vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=145)|
| 0:02:37| We've been very interested in changing that, so I want to, just very briefly, before I turn it over to Rick, and we want to be very respectful of your time, go over a little bit of the history of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=157)|
| 0:02:49| And I think, as you can see, people with my height, I'm blocking a little of that. In 2005, we undertook trying to be stewards of a process by which this property, which, and this is key, was owned by the state of Tennessee, could transition into private use, which I think most people agree was long overdue at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=169)|
| 0:03:14| The difficulty was the state of Tennessee was bound by their procurement process, which limited them only to surplusing property through a bid, and a high bid, without any regard for the nature of the use once that bid had been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=194)|
| 0:03:33| And we thought that the city, we definitely did not want to start a process that only the high bid, without any regard for usage and suitability for downtown and for the city, would be the determining factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=213)|
| 0:03:45| So in order to work with us, the state was very cooperative. We made use of the Industrial Development Board and worked out a very complicated process by which our Industrial Development Board would be the vehicle by which we could work with the state to get into a process that allowed a control or a specification of a development that would meet the interest of the city, and that we could evaluate proposals based on their contribution to downtown and to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=225)|
| 0:04:15| And other relevant factors, rather than just be at the whims of who might show up, possibly in a late minute with the highest check. We have more than one example where that has definitely not worked out well in Knoxville and in the city and outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=255)|
| 0:04:30| So we went through the process that I just described, and we had Metropolitan Plaza, nicknamed The Met, that was a fixed-use building that involved, you know, very ambitious, we were very pleased to have it, the proposal that had office, hotel, residential uses, retail uses, and unfortunately that did not work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=270)|
| 0:04:55| The developer was unable, after a number, you know, a couple of years, had to withdraw the team's proposal because financially it just wasn't feasible, and as you notice, the dates weren't really favorable to successful financing, starting in 2008, 7, 8, and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=295)|
| 0:05:13| So then we decided that we needed to work again through a process with the Industrial Development Board, and this was still through the stakes being the owner, and we had another project that was chosen through that RFP process that in the end involved mixed-use, not as involved a project, not as large a project as Metropolitan Plaza, but unfortunately that didn't work out either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=313)|
| 0:05:41| Now a couple of the reasons these projects didn't work out have to do with difficulties at the site, and I think one thing we might ought to say just at the beginning that I've noticed after my 14 years at the city is when you ask somebody to submit a proposal, they can do some preliminary groundwork at what's at the site, but it would be unreasonable to think that anybody could invest tens or a hundred thousand dollars doing, you know, the kind of work that they might have to do to actually get financial feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=341)|
| 0:06:11| Or understand the characteristics of the substrata and the geology and the geography, you know how difficult this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| So that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Then we decided, you know, what we needed to do, the city just needed to get control of this where we could, as a city, not have to go through some of the gyrations through the Industrial Development Board, which were quite difficult at times, and we decided at council, if you were on council, that we would purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=378)|
| 0:06:38| And we did that in 2015, and then in 2016, I'll meander over here to the arrow, we decided to again embark on the RFP project, and we did that in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=398)|
| 0:06:52| We selected the Supreme Court LFC, I guess we refer to you by Dover Development, or what is your appropriate title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| Well, I don't know if we don't want to offend Charles here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| It's Dover Development and Bristol Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Oh, Charles, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Charles, you look like, you didn't look too offended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| So, now, Charles Carlisle is with Bristol Development, and you'll learn more about what they do in a moment if you've met him before as well, Adam Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=428)|
| 0:07:19| And as you know, now we're getting into more contemporary times, the City Council approved a purchase and sailing agreement in last May, and then we had to amend that because of some time constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=439)|
| 0:07:36| Now, let me explain a little bit about the time constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| During that time, we have been in almost constant communication with and interaction with the development team, with Rick and Charles and their folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=460)|
| 0:07:51| And what we've had to do is go through a number of iterations, and we've had, you know, things we liked, things we didn't like, asked them to redo some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=471)|
| 0:08:01| So, this process has been getting this proposal, one which both sides could feel was comfortable, they were comfortable with, and I think that is something that's important to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| This wasn't a dead period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| This was a period of a lot of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| So, here we are in April of 2018, and where we have is we have a set of conceptual drawings and design that are getting down into really what this will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=493)|
| 0:08:26| As soon as we had this, we wanted to present this to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| I think we have heard, and with some justification, you don't need all of this piled upon you and a vote, you know, expected in the number of days or even a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| This is a very large and very important project, and we wanted to share these conceptuals with you and just make sure you were aware of where we were and had your ability to digest these and think about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=519)|
| 0:08:53| So, we're going to present these today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Now, let's get into the timeline that you approved when you voted for the amendment of the purchase of sale agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| We have until the end of this year to come up with a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| We are very optimistic that will not take nearly that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| We're quite far along in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| That development agreement will reference the drawings that you will see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| That will be the legal representation of what you'll be seeing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| We wanted you to be right up with us in where we were and make sure before we got into that next step that everybody was aware of what this project was going to be and what it was going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=562)|
| 0:09:33| So, once we – we also have by the end of 2018 the deadline for closing on the property, then a deadline – and again, we may or may not be able to move more quickly than this, but we have to specify endpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=573)|
| 0:09:49| By the end of 2019, construction should have commenced and then three years after construction is commencing, the project should be complete or predominantly complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=589)|
| 0:10:01| So, that's – this is the timeline past up to today, what we envision in the future, the steps we have along the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| And again, where we are today is we wanted to share these drawings that we've gone back and forth with and they put a lot of time and hard work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=608)|
| 0:10:18| And at that point, then, I'm going to turn it over to Rick or Rick and Charles and their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And what I think they would like to do is go through the entire thinking of the project and the drawings and all the angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| And then we have Ferris E. here, who's the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Be open for more specific questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| We want this – I know Rick wants this to be interactive as possible and this setting should enable that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| If I speak at this level, can you hear me okay or am I – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| I talk with my hand, so if I have a microphone, I get really distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| I'm Rick Dover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| I'm the general manager of Dover Development Corporation, and we are joint venture partners with Bristol Development Group out of Franklin, Tennessee, for the redevelopment of this fabulous piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=656)|
| 0:11:10| I thought I might start – what we're going to do, I'll go first, then Charles will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| I'll tell you a little bit about Charles and he can tell you a little bit about his firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| Ferris is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| We have architects from Raleigh, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Laurent de Cameron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Did I get that almost right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| And Ben Scott, who are specialists with Jay Davis in the urban multifamily project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| So you'll hear from all of us, but if you would permit us just to go through initially, just run through everything, and then we'll come back and zero in on everything that's on your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=701)|
| 0:11:50| And hopefully when we get done today, we will have gotten everybody comfortable with exactly what's being proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| So please feel free to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Let's get all your questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| This is a rendering of a church in Henley, which is our working title for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| I want to go through some of our main design parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Predominantly focused on multifamily urban living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| We've got to deal with parking and hospitality, food and beverage, and retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| So we're trying to combine all of these types of uses in a very urban project that connects this site, which is on the western side of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=747)|
| 0:12:40| And really, if you look at what we consider downtown Knoxville, we're right in the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| So a very dense project we feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| However, we've got to deal with the dollars and cents of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| So we're looking at what are the intended uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| What kind of revenue can be produced by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| What's the highest and best use for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| What can we build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| And can we cover the debt on it in order to get it financed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Because if it doesn't get financed, all these pretty pictures don't really mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| So clearly we've got a very, very high profile site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Very important site for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| We're very excited to be here looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| These are some contextual photographs of some of the other important architectural buildings in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| You already know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| As we drill down and look at this site, we've got some interesting features going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| And we've got some things that are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| We've got some things that are challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| So Henley is on our western border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| Henley is a bit of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| If you look at all the buildings up and down Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| certainly on the east side when you're northbound on Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| basically all those buildings have their back turned to Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| So it's not active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| It's predominantly a vehicular artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Obviously it's a big north-south connector in the main off-and-on ramp for I-40, I-75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| and a connector into south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| But we've got some important buildings around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| And if you look at the density there, it's really not that dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| We want to take it up a notch or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| We want to take it up as many notches as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| The site has got some interesting aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| So Bill talked about some of the back-and-forth dialogue that we've had since we've had it under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| One of the things that wasn't in the RFP request but is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Hello, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| What came up afterwards was is it possible to create some municipal parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| within the parking deck that's being envisioned here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| So the idea would be what could that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| What would it cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Would we as the developers be willing to develop that parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| and make that available to the city at cost, open book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| We certainly said yes to all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So we spent some time exploring what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Because of the topography of the site, we've got about 50 feet of fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| from Churchill Locust down to Henley and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| And because of the geotechnical aspects of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| that additional parking was going to have to be underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| which meant additional excavation, compaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| poured-in-place concrete for the parking structure, which may have cost a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| So I think we ended up, gosh, a little bit north of $40,000 in space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| on our preliminary estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| We certainly offered that to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| It was considered by the administration and Dr. Lyon's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| and came back to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| that just looks too expensive, too rich for our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Go back to what you were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Along the way, we dealt with traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| We have a traffic study now underway by SMME, our traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| We don't have that yet to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| That will be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| We've got challenges in that if you look at the site now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| there's a main on-and-off ingress and egress right in, right out on Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| So we went to TDOT to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| and the possibility of using it, of moving it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| We basically got told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| not only can you not move it, you can't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| So it's got to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Sorry, you people go back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Now we're down to three sites to get in and out of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| two of which are one-way streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| One of them, 6 p.m. outbound on Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| can get pretty busy right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| The other, inbound on Church in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| a lot of folks come down Henley and take a left on Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| to go to work downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| So how do we do this without stacking up traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| We met with the city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| We've got issues with tightness on corner radii not meeting code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| We've got ingress and egress out of the garage now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| that are not spatially such that they would meet current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| So we're looking at, we think, three BCA variances for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| So city engineering is encouraged to get that traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| complete, we'll figure out how to deal with this once that comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| So we've looked at a lot of complexity things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| On first blush, you wouldn't think we're necessarily going to be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| but as you get into these things, they become issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| and we'll deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| So the existing massing on the building inside us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| it's mostly surface parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| We've got the courthouse and the office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| They total about 57,000 square feet of existing space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| When we originally proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| we were looking at demolishing the office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| and the first three bays of the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| coming eastward on Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| leaving the courtroom to be reactivated as a bar and restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| We also had proposed an 11-story, 170-room hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| for the corner of Church and Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| With Starwood Hotel Group, that has turned out to be a bit of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Starwood got bought by Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Starwood had no product downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Marriott's got multiple products downtown and much more coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| And in the meantime, the courtyard residents' inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| went from 114 keys to 226.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| The Regis building got bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| It's now going to be 190-key embassy suites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| The Andrew Johnson building is now under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| to be approximately 100 rooms, keys, of boutique hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| And then just recently in the 400 block of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| the site beside Mass General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| between Mass General and the Century building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| has been sold to a local hotel developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| and that's being proposed now for another 150-key hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Marriott downtown, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| the biggest hotel in our market, 400 keys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| went into foreclosure, got rescued from foreclosure and resold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| and now it's being redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| And so all those units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| instead of potentially possibly coming off the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| and being in some other type use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| which was talked about certainly when the foreclosure was imminent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| they're now being reactivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| The top two, three floors have been closed for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| for mold and water intrusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| The whole building's being redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| So if you look at the competitive set for hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| the market is very dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| It's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And even our player at Starwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| who we thought was going to be a really interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| kind of sexy brand to work with here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| now they're owned by a big, gigantic public corporation in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| and they've changed the brand standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| So an aloft is no longer what an aloft used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| But nonetheless, we've re-signed with Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| So we have a preliminary franchise document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| executed by both Marriott and by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| They're talking to us about making it into more of a boutique-style product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| So we got cold feet as our lenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| on doing a new-build 170-key hotel prospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| in light of everything else going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| So we thought, well, what we really need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| and I've learned this from doing the Farragut Hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| and turning it into a Hyatt place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| is that what is most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| is the experience that the visitors have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Whether they're business travelers or leisure travelers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| you've got to stay focused on the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| that the guests start to finish in the whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| We've been very fortunate in the way our Hyatt place has started out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| It's now head of projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I looked tonight, they're 88% booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| So I'm very, very pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| We have a terrific brand in Hyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We have a terrific manager in White Lodging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| They're protecting their average nightly rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| They're not discounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| and they're creating the top experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| for guest experience scores in the Hyatt system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| That Hyatt place, and there are 340 of them worldwide now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| it's number one in the guest experience scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| in the entire port.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| So we're pretty happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| And like Hyatt, what I've learned from Hyatt and White| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| is never take your eye off the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| on what is the guest experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| And so what the hotel people are telling me about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| and candidly, once Mary I bought Starwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| I started looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| So Hyatt now has a brand called Centric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| which is a boutique brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Hilton has something called Curio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| They have something called Canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| They've got another couple of them in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Intercontinental Hotel Groups has Indigo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| and they have another one, a new one they're just rolling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| called Avid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| So Hilton, Hyatt, Intercontinental Hotel Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| and Marriott, which now has 30 brands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| are all interested in doing a boutique hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| with us here on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So we're exploring the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Ferris is here doing the hotel design for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| so as we get into the Q&A part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| if you've got some specific questions on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| we'll get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Right now, I'm going to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| nothing more than a white block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| because candidly, I don't know what it's going to be named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| I kind of like the Courthouse Hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| or whatever it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| but we're thinking more of local, authentic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| boutique experience on the hotel side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| rather than a big branded flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| We've also talked to some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| in some other bigger urban markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| that are now doing Airbnb hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| designed right out of the box to be done with Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| all with each individual room being completely unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| and no brand standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| which is radically different than the hotel business has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| And interestingly enough, what it's proven to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| in these big urban markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| it's pretty doggone successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| As an operator, you're cutting out about 16%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| of your operating costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| because you're not paying all these branding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| and franchising, and marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| and credit card fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| and all this stuff that they just tag you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| every time you turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| So initially, on the Airbnb hotel side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| what came out was that they were very successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| on the weekends with leisure travelers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| but a little bit less so for business travelers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| during the week that wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| you know, they kind of wanted to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| what their experience was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| but they had really gained some traction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| that they were done well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| and your guest scores were good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| and the experience was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Everybody looks at TripAdvisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| booking.com, hotels.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Trivago, and reads all those reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| They don't really care so much anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| as, oh, I'd like to stay a holiday inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Well, not a holiday inn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| or pick a brand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| but people are really not that worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| They do get rewards points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| but that's something the Airbnb doesn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| So we're interested in all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| and we're going to explore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| and as Bill alluded to in the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| we've got a little time to put all this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| but in the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| we need a little bit of flexibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| You'll see that when it comes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| but ultimately, this council will have the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| or the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| the city will have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| to approve whatever the flag is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| if there is a criteria being here or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| So that is a fluid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| It's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| I feel comfortable that it's going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| We've downsized the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| right-sized, we think, in 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| We still have a great bar and restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| We still think that now we can do one on the roof here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| as well as in the courthouse part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| We've got to deal with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| That's another issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| but what we plan on doing is reactivating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| those existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| We feel like that's the most sustainably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| environmentally responsible thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| is to use existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Obviously, the existing office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| is not that good-looking a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| and it's going to need a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and a complete re-skin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| but hey, that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| We can also do an addition onto the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| which is what the blue blob is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| It would allow cars to drive off Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| under the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| This is actually the grazing floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| and go into the parking deck for the multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| So the food and beverage operation is very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Boutique Hotel, that's the way we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| At this point, I know we want to run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| all this quickly and get back to the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| I want to introduce you to Charles Carlyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Some of you all know Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Charles is the CEO of Bristol Development Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Their offices are in Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| and they have done fabulous urban multi-family projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Come on up, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I'll let Charles tell you a little bit about his background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| a little bit about the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| and then we'll introduce the team that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| and get into whatever your questions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Charles Carlyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thanks. Thank you, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| On behalf of Bristol Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I'm delighted to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| For those of you who are new on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| I'll give just a little bit of a thumbnail sketch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| of who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| But before I talk about Bristol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I can talk a little bit about how excited I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| to be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I actually lived in Knoxville for about 24 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| for college, went to school here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| and worked most of the time in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| And so it's really exciting to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and see what downtown Knoxville has become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| and to have the opportunity to partner with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| and with Rick to take this vital block in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| and do something in the way of a redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| that hopefully contributes back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| So Bristol Development Group has been in business since 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| We're based in Franklin, just outside Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| We focus primarily on multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| with a mixed-use component of retail and much of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| We have done about 35 projects in seven states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| That comprises 8,700 or so apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| a value of what we have completed of about $1.2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| And then our current pipeline is about $350 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| of construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| And right now those projects are in Richmond, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| Louisville, Kentucky, Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Birmingham, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And of those, four of those are downtown redevelopment projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| much like this, most with a retail component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| like what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| So it's something that we take a lot of interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| and we are always looking, even when we do suburban work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| we try to do things that are heavily developed suburbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| where we can do infill development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| as opposed to the old traditional greenfield multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| spread out over multiple acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Then the other thing I'd like to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| is just a little bit about what the apartment development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| would be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| And then I'm going to let Laurent and Ben| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| talk about the actual design and show you the pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| At Bristol, one of our strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| is to try to create true communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| We've learned over the years that if we can connect people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| inside our communities so that they feel like they're part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| then they'll stay with us longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| So as a selfish rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| we try to create places that people want to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| And so when we design our amenity spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| and our outdoor spaces, we're trying to always think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| not just how it looks, but how it's used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| and whether it's something that people will actually use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| to connect with each other in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| And so this, like most of our urban environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| is a highly amenitized community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| We're designing about 230 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| That's a mix of 70% to 80% one-bedroom apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and 20% to 30% two-bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| ranging from studio apartments of 470 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| up to two-bedroom apartments at about 1,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Amenities, let me say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| one of the things that the city challenged us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| and that we've spent a lot of time thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| is how do we treat Henley Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Rick said Henley is not an obvious retail street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| because there's no other retail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| There's no on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Traffic's going by quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| And so the challenge was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| how do we try to activate that street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| And so you'll see what we've tried to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| is put as many of our amenity and public spaces as we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| on Henley to give the appearance of commercial retail space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| that will be utilized by our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| in a way that for people driving by or walking by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| would look like it's a commercial retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| So our leasing area and management offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| would be at the corner of Church and Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| connected to a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| accessible cafe, coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| with an outdoor seating area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| that to passersby would look just like a regular coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Our fitness center would be adjacent to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| again, facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Our bike shop, we always do bike storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| bikes like lounges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| such as where people who enjoy riding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| can hang out before and after they ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| And there'll be tools and storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| And then one of the other sort of popular amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| in many communities today is a pet spa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| But we're going to design it to look like a commercial pet spa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| even though it's for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| And so we think we've really come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| that will have a great look and feel on Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| And we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| And Ben can show you that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Other amenities will be located in this little courtyard area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| that is surrounded by apartments up on an elevated area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| above the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| There would be a pool, outdoor kitchens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| an indoor-outdoor space that would provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| almost like an outdoor cafe or beer garden space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| that could be used in the spring and fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| even with outdoor space heaters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| for watching sporting events or TV or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| And so, again, all of that's focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| toward trying to build community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| So I think with that, I'm happy to try to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| in a minute, but Laurent and Ben,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| if you all want to walk through the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1937)|
| 0:32:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I'm Laurent de Comermont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| I'm an architect and a principal at J. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| And we are a multidisciplinary firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| with offices in Raleigh and Philadelphia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| And we work on this type of urban infill project a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| And we really enjoy them because we get to tie into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| the existing urban fabric and, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| creating a new sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| And this site specifically is interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| because it ties into the downtown street grid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| but at the same time, there's this edge condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| that is a challenge, but that we really focused a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| on the streetscape design and activity in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| So we're going to run through the plans and elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| quickly, and then we're going to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| if you have specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| And this is Ben Scott, who's a part of the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| To orient you on the plan, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| to start with the subject of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| There's oriented land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Henry Street is on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Come around from the bottom, the church on the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| and come to the top, the locals on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| There's about 30 feet of drop over the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| so the plans have to step up as it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| This is the basement, which is entirely parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and the loading and the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| Facing on the Henry Street, you have the leasing office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| and the cafe, as well as the fitness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| and the electrical storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Facing on the Henry, and a level above the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| for parking on the church street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| as well as an exit from the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Up on Locust Street, there is a corner of Locust and Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| Ben, excuse me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Could you speak up just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I'm looking at the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| He doesn't look like he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I'm old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| I can't hear very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Yes, so at the corner of Church and Locust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| we've got a space that we intend to be a retail space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| but it is designed in such a way that it should retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and not be able to be leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| It could be a ground level residential as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| It's designed flexibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| There is, as well as a parking deck entrance again on Locust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| and a portico chair for the courthouse hotel and restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2107)|
| 0:35:16| The upper floors are a ring of apartment units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| around the central private corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| The exterior design is designed so that we want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| substantial high-volume materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| We have a base of brick and steel with the upper floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| being stucco and a party panel for the legal system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| with canopies and brick-steel balconies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| This is the elementary elevation with the leasing office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| entry in the corner with canopies and lots of glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| to activate that camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| There will be outdoor seating for the cafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| the trellis and bar walls and some blinders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| as well as some glazing opening up into the fitness area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| to keep that transparent and keep the street active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| as well as the entrance to the storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| As you can see, we really focus on the first two floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| and their pedestrian experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Turn the corner and go down Church Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| where the street slows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| This is where the building steps up with the grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| and changes the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| We're going to be building into two smaller pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| and changing the material to help break down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| what would otherwise be a very large, long facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| We have an architectural treatment of the parking garage screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| We've talked about potentially involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| a little art community in designing a screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| It's just a placeholder of what that could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Then up on Bunker Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| continuing the other picture around the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| we've got a potential retail space here on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| at the base of 95th Avenue Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| and the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| This is an elevation of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| that meet the block of the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| We've ghosted out a couple of memories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| of the reform of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| This is the corner of Church Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| and the other is the corner of Church and Locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| We're going to have to wait very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| to get an overview of the plans and elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| but we're happy to go back and answer your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| and get into specific questions about the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| This is not normally a mute council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| No, all these guys are mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2305)|
| 0:38:37| I need to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I kind of excluded Ferris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| and I didn't want to come off that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Ferris is a project architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| You all know Ferris City very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| But I wanted to just kind of run through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| I don't have the detailing on the hotel side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Ferris is a project architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| so he's more focused on the hotel side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| But because Laurent has spent so much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| detailing the multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| the historic drive and the activation of the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| we wanted to get a little bit more fine-grained detailing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| from them initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| but we're happy to have whatever level of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| To clarify, but you're committed to the courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| the historic front of the courthouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Can I ask a question on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| This side, this elevation here, that's the courthouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| That faces the side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| You're on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| This is the least detailed streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| Yes, because it blocks most of the multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| We would have had more specific detailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| You can see from this one...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| It's in your package as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| As you can see, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| That's Cumberland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| No, this is Locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| This is Locust, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We'd be standing in the intersection of Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and Locust looking north, westward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Right across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| In front of the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| The two-dimensional elevations are sometimes misleading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| because it's literally standing on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| looking into the side of that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| and because the old courthouse office building is all white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| that's really all you're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| And then the apartments are back behind it like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| in this image on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| The intent of the courthouse renovation is to be renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| The skin, obviously, gives it new functionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| as a hotel lobby, restaurant lounge area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| and also, if you notice, underneath the residential component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| there's an entrance for the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| that was tied into the courthouse as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| And so, just as Rick and everyone's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| the fact that we do not have a hotel grandia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| it does not make sense to us to be presenting a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| Right, so this picture is not showing me the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| It's just showing me the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| The courthouse would be in the foreground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| It would be the outline, like a ghostly outline of the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| That was what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| It's lacking, there's no detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| You don't want me to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| You want me to look beyond and see just the residential part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| At this point, part of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| So we're only talking about the residential portion, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| You've got more detail on the exterior skin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| and the texture of the materials on the apartment side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| than you do on the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| But the hotel, the courtroom, is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| It's all planned in Tennessee, being marbled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| The office building might be doing this building downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I don't see keeping that yellow brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| I really see us re-skinning the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| You haven't shown me a picture. I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| I completely ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| It's forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| It's very forgettable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| So the idea would be to renovate and restore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| from a historic perspective, the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| and reactivate the office building as opposed to not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| We're going to change the appearance of the office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| But the courthouse, the exterior will largely be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Mr. Dover, can you maybe talk to us a little about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| maybe you're not the right one to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| but the geological challenges that you've run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| with this particular plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| If you don't mind, I'll let Gary say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| As in most downtown environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| downtown's got caves in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Downtown has rock at various heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| So it's just a matter of working with a soil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and designing the right foundation base on the right slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| It's been done at practically every building downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| that's ever been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| So this will not be any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Has it limited the scope of what you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| in any particular direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| or the things that you wanted to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| No, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| So far, the design that you see in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| is more driven by the efficient use of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| And then the foundations and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| would follow as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| And then, Mr. Lyons, this may be a good question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Was there a discussion at some point about a vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| for Henley Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Because it certainly sounded from the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| that there was some emphasis on trying to activate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| as a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| So maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| For a long time, both by council and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| we know there's been a real concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| with the nature of Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And having this, once we had this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I think the right terminology to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| is activating the street to as large a degree as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| And that's, in fact, a lot of our discussion over this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| has been in some iterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| where we wanted to push a little bit to get Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| to be a live street that people would walk by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| would walk down, that would have light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| that makes the pedestrian experience work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| as opposed to the blank wall syndrome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| which is the thing we wanted to most avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Of course, the reality we face is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| and we face this in other parts of town occasionally, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| is you just can't mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| some on the South Waterfront, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| you just can't mandate retail in a spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| where there isn't any likelihood of getting a tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| and it really hurts the financing of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| It makes it very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| We have to face some market realities in order to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| So we work with this team to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| let's be as creative as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| with all the elements of activity you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| to make sure this is a live street as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| And I think, you know, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| as much window addressing the street as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| people, activity, outside activity, even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| So that's been our approach in working with the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| is to maximize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| and I think that we've done a good job of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| Let me follow up on that just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| What about circling back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| and considering some of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| made in the ULI study a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| at least part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Well, those involve, you know, traffic on Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| We have done as much as we can do that within our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| People may not realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| but we filled in a median that was concrete with grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| at the Cumberland end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| We want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| we may be able to do some things with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| about making the street crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| with all the activity traffic off to Slo More,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| but they're very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| we have given the TDOT highway and given the traffic a scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| I mean, there isn't a whole lot we can do to Henley itself right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| We can't take away lanes and do things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| This is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Rick, I think it looks like you've changed the focus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Who is this being built for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Who's the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| In other words, you said most of them are single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| single family or single?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| On the apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| One person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| I'm happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Can you all hear back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Dude, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Just come around the corner maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I tend to talk too loudly anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| but we have a lot of these urban apartment communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| and what we find is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| imagine a barbell with one end with a heavy weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| and one end with a little bit lighter weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| and so that lopsided barbell represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| the demographic profile of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| At the heavy end of the barbell are people just coming out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| so you're talking about early 20s and mid-30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| As you probably know about dormitory life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| most of those people have come out of an experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| where at minimum they have a private bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| and in some cases they have a private apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| and they don't want roommates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| They want to live by themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| and so they'll gladly take a 550-square-foot apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| that they can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| instead of living in a 1,200-square-foot apartment with a roommate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| And so in these environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| we design a heavy on the one bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| and heavy on the smaller one bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| to appeal to that clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| The wider end of the barbell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| our second largest demographic component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| are people 55 and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and surprisingly a fairly large percentage of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| will live in small apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| and they choose that because of affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| and so that's another reason that the one bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| are the dominant portion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| And then the middle of the barbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| is kind of everything in between people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| the Gen Xers and early Bayview Boomers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| So I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| As I say, speaking of affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| what is the range that you're thinking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| We think we will be in the slightly above $2 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| The Marble Alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| which is the newest apartment community downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| right now is just slightly above $2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| and we've pegged to be maybe 5% or so above them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| in terms of what we think we could get financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| So if you said an average 800 square foot apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| then it would be maybe $1,600 to $1,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2965)|
| 0:49:35| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| George, speak to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| So even in the examples we've shown here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| and what's around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| there's a good emphasis in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| on brick and limestone and steel and glass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| and certain architectural details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| and yet you've shown some black brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| and some hardy panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| which I kind of understand what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| and then a lot of stucco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| and a lot of same size windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| and a lot of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| I don't see a lot of striking architectural details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| that makes that building pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| And, you know, talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| I mean, why those materials and why not more brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| and more in keeping with what downtown architecture already is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| or what's already here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Yeah, so this building is away from the core of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| in terms of direct connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| to some of the older buildings on Gates Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| So I think it was the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| to kind of create a new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| something more unique on that side of town here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| But I think we've looked at a lot of fenestration patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| and massing from all the existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| all the older buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| and then kind of reinterpret them in a contemporary way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| But we feel like we're using very durable materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| You know, there's a limited use of brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| but the reveal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| it is a cement board, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| reveal system as well as stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And so I think it's inspired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| by some of the older downtown buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| but in terms of massing and fenestration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| it's trying to kind of have a new material pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| Yeah, it's also playing on a lot of the other buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| So compact mass, punched opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| there is some variety of window size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| It's also playing on some of its immediate context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| like the conference center across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| where there's a lot of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| The conference center across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| bright, white, plain, brick walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| sheet of tile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| It's sort of also playing a little bit off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| where there's a lot of bright color and flat planes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| And I think also, you know, at the ground level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| we're really going for this transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| and the use of steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| And so I think that in that context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| sort of having more masonry, more brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| you know, light camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| some of that design work to give transparency there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| Do you have anything to add, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Ramanti, how many units again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| How many units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| 230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| 230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| The only thing I'd add to that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| one of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| I'm not an architect by training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| and I'm not very good at design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| That's nothing out of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| But one of the things I have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| rarely do people experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| a building like these renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| You either experience it in your car up close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| or you experience it as a pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| And so, I mean, I think the massing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| and the use of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| selective use of the balconies and offsets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| and things like that are very attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| and we're a big fan of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| But what I'm really excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| is what this is going to feel like at street level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| as a pedestrian or as a passenger in a car going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| I think the way those first two or three floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| are going to feel is going to be spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| I guess my point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| it seems to be a lot of repetitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| in window size and the window shapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| and the views are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| it looks a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| we've broken it up some with some balconies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| it looks good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| but a lot of it is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| there's a lot of similar stuff repeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| And this is the core of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| I mean, it's the opportunity for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| to set a high standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| I mean, the conference center that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| that the university owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| is probably not the highest and best used long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| And it's, maybe someday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| you know, so, I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I agree, I mean, it's the street level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| has got to have a great feel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I think I totally applaud that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| but I just see some of the other stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| as being very repetitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| and somewhat ridiculous from looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| the drawings don't tell whole stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| and I get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| but I see a lot of stucco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| and a lot of the same materials repeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| I like the color change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I think that adds some dimension that's unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| And that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Okay, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| And we can look at that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| in terms of the ratio, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| kind of raising to a solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| It was part of the party to have this very kind of grid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| you know, a very kind of rigid grid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| you know, kind of a modernist design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| but we can definitely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| play with that a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| and have a warmer idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Let me go back to the material just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Here on page seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| you show a photo of a condo unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| on the corner of Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| I guess, is that Walnut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Are these probably from Bristol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Oh, these are examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| That's a market square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Market square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| What is that material on the exterior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| That is stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| That's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Stucco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| I believe it's got a brick base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| It's got some brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| It's a two-color brick base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| That's a brick walnut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Well, the reason I ask the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| that's not weathering well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| If you look at it real close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| you don't even have to look at it real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It's looking kind of long in the tooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Actually, I think it's a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| of stucco and some left-siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| Yeah, well, maybe that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| There's some water issues in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| so I think that would be a key barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Yeah, and that was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| If we're using the same material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| that it doesn't do what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Whatever it is, it has to be maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| and cleaned and looked after properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| And that building is a condo, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| It is a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| You've got a homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| that may not be quite as diligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| in ongoing maintenance and appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| and purpose-build as Bristol would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| in their context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Well, that one feels good in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Yeah, now it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Now it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| That one does look fine in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| What's the transparency at the street level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Like, what's the percent transparency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Do you all remember what's required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| And what do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| You've got a tall ceiling height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| and you've got, like, a long handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| A long handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| So for the pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| I hear what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| about pedestrian fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| The drawings don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| aren't telling me the full picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| So do you remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| To me, that first floor looks as...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I mean, that's got a ton of glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Most retail that you're going to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| certainly in an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| So we try to activate that glass light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| The close-up on the front page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| gives a much better indication, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| of what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| which is pretty much full-height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| down that entire elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Yeah, so that's Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| On Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Could you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| I just didn't know if you were finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| so I was going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| We don't have buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| We don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| I feel lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Could you turn to page 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Because I think this sort of highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| what George was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| It's the church thing about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| I think this photo sort of highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| what you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| the windows and sort of a whole block of walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| But the other reason I wanted to talk about 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| is where they tend to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| I think, what you've done on Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I think that really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| I mean, I think if we're going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| to activate Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| you've got to kind of activate some path to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| I don't know if it's Comfort Center or church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| and I know the Comfort Center doesn't do a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| but that's sort of like a parking garage wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| And you do notice a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Like the Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| both the Tennessee and the Farragut side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| that sort of corridor down has windows on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| It makes a big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| versus some of the other garages around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Well, there's the Hilton garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| It's pretty dark on that one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| But anyway, was there an intent to try to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| on sort of the sides on church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Or was it just to focus on Henley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| The design you see is a placeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| and because we don't have anything worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| about what I'm going to describe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| we just had to put something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| What our goal is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| and this is one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| that we originally proposed to do on Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| is to work with the local arts community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| and create some type of art experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| along Church Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| so that it does do exactly what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| that church ties Henley back to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| and provides a better experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| than just walking along a blank wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| That's some type of a metal grid system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| We haven't had any of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| We haven't had any kind of development of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| So I can't tell you how that's going to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| What I'm thinking to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| is maybe some type of permanent installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| as well as some type of either revolving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| or interactive art kind of installations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| along that wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| because I think that would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| that adds interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| and maybe would actually attract people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| walking down to Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| And we've reached out to your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| You all have a public arts committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Well, to Stair's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| that's a lot of walk with nothing on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Nothing on the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| So there's no way, Rick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| to get that parking underground there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| and get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Well, we've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| The parking garage is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| so there's an underground level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| and then you go...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| It's a half level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| and then you go full levels up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So the idea was let's create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| a public arts space here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| because we didn't want to do doorsteps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| and that retail right on the sidewalk...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| I mean, the residential right on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| is generally not the most active way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| We didn't envision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| as immediately viable for retail space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| but we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| well, let's create a public experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| through public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| It will sponsor and pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| We'll put out a call for art, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| I think it'll work out pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| It's very efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| And then we'll create an experience here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| where folks are like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| wow, that's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Let's go check that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| because in working with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| we had originally thought of creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| that public arts experience on Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| and the feedback we got from Dr. Lyons and staff was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| let's create people, glass, light activity on Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| and so Charles moved the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| leasing operation business center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| bikes, the health...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| I mean, the health thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| All that went to Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| and so we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| well, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| We really want to do this public art thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| It's an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| and it's hard to express in a two-dimensional...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| But as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| we've got some fabulous artists in this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| that can create things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| on some really interesting scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| large and small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| And so we think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| We're doing something similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| in Louisville, Kentucky right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| We've worked with a local arts community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| We have a musician in residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| who has already moved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| and I can get into more detail about what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| We're looking for a visual artist in residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| who can stay with us for a year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| We have an exhibit on the inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| on the main corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| of local art that will rotate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| over the course of a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| and we're working with the same arts group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| to get some urban art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| I mean, really good quality urban art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| This is an edgy neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| and have that on the corner outside of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| And there's some great things that I think we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| It's just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| at this stage of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| we haven't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I think we're saying it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| in the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| and you're saying it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So we'll look to see if it develops further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Those are all good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I wanted to add that that is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| what we had very much dialogue about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| But I think the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| and we thought the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| on Henley was kept now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| with what we really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| But this is a good opportunity over on Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| But I think that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| not having a dead street space is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| We didn't want to build a spec retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| that had the opportunity to sit there dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| So the idea was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| let's create a storefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Let's create a lot of glass and light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| at the street level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| and let's activate that right out of the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| so there's no sitting around with a four-leaf sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| I think, you know, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| I don't need another name in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| but down there across from the fire hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| going up towards Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| that little short street where Enterprise is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| yeah, that little retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| it created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| it's kind of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| oh, it won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| But, I mean, it's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| It's really busy down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| And I drove through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| parked through there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| And, you know, there's people out in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| getting their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| I mean, it's a pretty active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| So, I mean, it can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| You know, it wouldn't totally discount it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| But I think it's more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| how long you're walking down a long space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| that's just dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| You've got to make it come alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| I think part of the issue, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| since we're keeping this building here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| and it's taking so much depth at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| we don't have so much room left for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| activate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| to put some active uses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| would reduce the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| And we're kind of running out of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| But we are trying to activate the two corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| So, we're trying to limit the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| 230 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| How many apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| There's one per bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| So, one bedroom unit is one parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| A two-bedroom unit is two parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| And you take that total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| and multiply it by about .95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And that's all based on studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| that we have done of peak demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| at projects all over the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| And that's probably over-parked at that ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| But we don't want to be under-parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| 360 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Well, there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| I think altogether there were 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| Yeah, right at 400 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| So, here we are at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| at the April meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| and conceptual designs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| which we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| What are the next steps now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| between now and the development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Well, the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| will reference this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| as what we will anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| And the rest of it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| really has to do with the nitty-gritty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| of a lot of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| about making sure what's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| is in fact built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| and all these sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| that become challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| of the city protecting its interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| and assuring that we have what we've approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| And on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| doing so in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| that the developers can get secure financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| have their financial integrity of the project protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| So, we have been working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| and will continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| And I can't give you any dates right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| but I think we're fairly...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| We don't anticipate this being anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| that goes over a number of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| rather than months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| And then once that's signed off on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| all the earnest money's down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| everybody's committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| then they go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| on getting ready for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| and construction right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| So then we see the real plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| as opposed to conceptual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Yeah, that will be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Will we see another conceptual plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| before we see the development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| You'll see it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Yeah, we'll give you the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| It'll have to be prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| plenty of time prior for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| to have to take a vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Council, are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| I didn't have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| I just was going to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| when we were going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| about this elevation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| is to make it more interactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| because you're between the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| and the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| So, you have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| for both the college community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| and children as well as the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| going from the hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| So, I would emphasize the interactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Not just pretty yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| but I don't know if that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| getting a picture taken with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| or what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Everybody wants an Instagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Something you can touch, move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| do something with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| within the bounds of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| That does spark another question for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| and that is the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| approximately to the World's Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Is there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| I assume there's thought given to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| I think that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Obviously, the bridge above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| is not going to particularly help there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| We have some things...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| we anticipate every reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| to put all this life on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| This should help slow and calm the traffic somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| just with people driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| You know, people slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| when things are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| We, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| there are some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| we can make that crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| much more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| and much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| through landscaping and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| So, I think that needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| and improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| and that's anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Council, are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| If not, we will adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180419?start=4126)|
