| 0:03:34| Real brief, a couple items for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| We'll be having one of our walking tours in Timbercrest neighborhood this Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| It's at the 19th, starting at 530, starting there at the Timbercrest neighborhood pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| And then the following Tuesday, the 24th, we'll be having a walking tour in Lonsdale, beginning at the park there in front of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| Again, starting at 530 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Obviously, everybody is welcome for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Another item I want to let everybody on council know, and I meant to get an e-mail out to you earlier, so I'll just do it verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| As you remember back, we had the Broadway and Fifth Avenue Task Force that came back to us with a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| and then the north central corridor plan that MPC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| And Councilman Becker and a few others have rightly noted, well, who's going to own this and kind of the execution of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| And we've talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| He has not given up his day job, but Bob Wetzel is going to have kind of ongoing day-to-day responsibility for executing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| and kind of following through on some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| He is still going to be the Director of Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| I want to be real clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| And we'll still stay working for Sam in that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| But he will be the person who's waking up thinking about that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| If you have any questions, we can talk about that more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Okay, I think I saw Councilman Frost light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| I just want to let folks know a good thing about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Friday night just decided to make a last-minute decision visit to go up to the Sun Sphere with my wife and two boys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| and there was a line to get in the Sun Sphere on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| We had to wait for about four elevators to make their trips before we were able to get on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| and it was about shoulder to shoulder once you got up to the observation deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| So it's obviously being very well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Yeah, just two announcements about Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Lonsdale Homecoming, which is a great event, pulling a lot of folks in Lonsdale together, a parade, lots of music and food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| will be the weekend of August 3rd, 4th, and 5th at Sam Hill School Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| Everybody should come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| It goes on for a long time and is a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| And then also about Lonsdale, there will be the grand opening of the new Lonsdale Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| which is next to Lonsdale School on Monday, August 13th at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| The mayor will be there to make some glorious speech about Lonsdale, and we're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Other comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I just wanted to say last week I brought up this sort of hype in a lot of raw materials being stolen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=369)|
| 0:06:18| copper and so forth, and there was an article in the New Sentinel today about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| And we're going to do a resolution on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| encouraging our state and federal elected officials to really look at the way that this sort of goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| with scrap metal dealers buying this stuff without any delays or any sort of identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| But that really does need to be looked into because especially in a lot of these lower income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| these thieves are going in people's basements and ripping out their plumbing and their copper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| and they get $100, $150 worth of goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| and it costs the property owners who can't afford it $800, $1,000 to repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| But it is an epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| It is a big problem, and I still want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| We didn't get it on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| And I say this all because not only do we need to make our state and federal people aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| but we need to make our community aware to look out for these people around in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| So I bring it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| I just want to pass that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Counselor Becker, that's your original line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| We will move on to Item Number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| 8A is a resolution appointing Cynthia Andresen to serve as a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=443)|

| 0:08:12| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| This is more a statement than a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Gary Norman from the Department of Permit Inspection wanted me to remind people when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| we start looking at his budget and how much he's able to fund his budget to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| that we're taking money out of that and he's actually doing considerably better than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| number is going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| So he wanted me to pass that along and it's very true and his department does a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| job at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| I just noted that Director Martin is smiling there, nodding his head, knowing that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| is going to be something he has to consider next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| But I still feel that this is a very good move on our part as we're really looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| try to have some infill development and to find creative ways to bring some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| to some areas of the city that very desperately need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| So we know that you will be able to find a nickel or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Exhibit A, I guess, to the original resolution, is that going to be attached to this amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| orders now that we've added infill into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| The original Exhibit A did not contemplate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| And I don't know that we necessarily need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| But has anyone thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Because Exhibit A only deals with the H1 and NC1 as it relates to the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| It doesn't mention anything about the infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| I think we need to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| There's no reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| So let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| We will make that and reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=590)|

| 0:11:31| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Yeah, two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| There's an amendment on this, and I want to point out, again, there's not a need to pass this tonight if people want to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| what's being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| We want to get this done for the Fire Department's boot day, but that's still after the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| The amendment on this is to delete what is, I guess, E on this, which is Sherman and Texas Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| to change J to Esri at Jacksboro Pike as opposed to Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| That was a misprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| And then to add Cedar at Central, Cedar Lane at Central Avenue, add Kingston Pike at Knowlton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=727)|
| 0:12:18| add Summit Hill at Hall of Fame, and add Middlebrook at Venosdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| I think that's the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| So that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| There's a motion to amend there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Is there a second to the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| I just had a question in regard to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| We'll go ahead and let you go ahead and ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| That'd be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Yeah, that'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| I was just very puzzled when I received a copy of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| because two of those intersections are in the district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| I haven't heard from the Fire Department or from the Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| I didn't even hear from you or anyone in regard to the plans to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| and I just am really appalled that that recommendation would be put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| and I would not be aware of it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| We're now coming on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| I'm going to take all these lights as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| I guess I'm going to have to ask a question since nobody responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Oh, I mean, I'm waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Well, my question is, from, you know, where did these suggestions come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| I want to know where they stem from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Mr. Becker, why don't you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| It's not that I oppose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| It's just that I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I think, again, Ms. Pila, part of the reason I started by saying we can put this off is because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| you know, this is a second reading with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| So, I mean, we have no problem with considering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| This is a discussion that's happening between KPD and members of the firefighters talking about, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| about how to get boot day done, which is a big day for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Trying to move out of some of the more dangerous intersections and other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| And what this became is where formerly we had Kingston Pike at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| Wanted to move that somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| And, frankly, we said we'll move it up to Knowlton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| We can move it over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| And sort of just the three of us said, oh, let's pick this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| It's not set in stone by any form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| So it's very open to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| This is a very arbitrary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| The police are real clear that some intersections are not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Haven't been able to figure out a way to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| And that's a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Sometimes it's easy for a person who represents that district to be in on that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| and maybe might be in more of a position like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| We can put this off and keep talking, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Esri Road at Tazewell Pike, if it's placed at Esri and Jacksboro Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| there's a fire hall right at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| I was just wondering why Esri at Tazewell Pike versus Jacksboro Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| Because the person who wrote this down wasn't good with geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| I mean, it just got called the wrong name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| So that would have to be amended, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Yeah, that was part of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I know Teddy is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Is he still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| He was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| In terms of the timing, I mean, do we have a little more time on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Because, you know, when I listen to some of these intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| I know firsthand that, you know, maybe an east-west on Kingston Pike would be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| But coming out of some of these shopping centers is, to me, a really sort of hazardous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| One thing is with you guys, the fire department, and some other of these charitable organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| they do have some sense of responsibility and understanding of safety and traffic and cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| and getting in and out of the intersections and streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| But I've seen a lot of groups out there that it's just a wonder no one got run over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| or that you didn't have a rear-end collision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| And so it's not you guys that I'm so much concerned about, but it's these other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Some of them aren't even legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| And I know there's a lot of extensive paperwork that you have to go through in order to get to be allowed to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| And I'm certain these other bunch that I see out there sometimes haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| So I'd like a little more time to think about it and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| rather than to be faced with voting on some of these amendments up here, if that's okay, Teddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| And I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Councilman Bailey made my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Also, I'd like for someone, I guess whoever deals with the solicitation permits department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| whoever puts those out, I'd like to know what those requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| You know, to step one step a little further than what Councilman Bailey said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| my concern, as I stated last time, and that's why I pulled several intersections off that were in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| is there are folk and agencies that tend to get out and do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| and I think that becomes a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Especially for some of the young kids I see in my district who get out with very worthy causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| but because they see, you know, the example of some more professional groups doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| they feel they can do it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| And I'm put in a tedious position of, well, the fire department or the Kiwanis or Shriners did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1043)|
| 0:17:32| Why can't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| And if we go down and get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| So this whole issue of solicitation requesting at intersections is very perplexing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I would like someone to tell me down the line or e-mail me, whoever is over at that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| what the basic requirements are because there may be where I can find a way to hopefully protect some of the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| in my district from being in a dangerous position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| And I'd also like to think about a couple more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| One street there was that is Summit Hill and Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| It's a very busy intersection right now, very wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| So I'd like to give that some thought since that's in my district also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| So I'd like to see it postponed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Councilman Hulkos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Councilman Becker, do I understand that you're saying by substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| or substantial number of amendments being added that that converts it to a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| I mean, we could do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Our council isn't here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| but my understanding is when you have substantive amendments that it goes back to first reading status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| Whereas if we amended things out, if we removed streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| that's something we could do within the second reading approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| So I'm just trying to get a little clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| That's the way I read that, though, but I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| I don't disagree with Councilman Hulkos on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| We're adding four additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| That's a substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| So passage tonight would be a passage on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| So a postponement wouldn't be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| We'd be considering it again anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| You could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Well, no, you couldn't do it either way because it requires another first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Your options are either to pass it as amended and it would be the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| or to pull it back and then probably it would be the first reading two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Mr. Becker, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Just two clarifying things for folks who've ‑‑ I'm pleased to say I know more about this than I care to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| One thing is that this is only allowed on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| One of the concerns, the police department shared yours on Summit Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| but weekends that's not near as busy an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| The other thing related to getting permission to do this is you actually have to have a solicitations permit from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| which is a pretty extensive process, a lot of documentation that the firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| they're going through that now, can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| And then you'd need to get approval from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| and the police department actually can say on a given weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| And we've talked about the one Cumberland at 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| The police department can say on a football weekend you can't do anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| And part of what's happened, a lot of these groups that have been out there that have not looked safe have not gotten permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And that's an issue at some point I'd love to hear the chief talk a little bit about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| I want you to remind me when the boot day is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| Right now it's August 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Right now we have a motion to amend on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| And just so I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| it's a substantial enough amendment that this would actually go back to this would be voted on as first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| I think under those circumstances I'm okay with doing it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| There are streets in my district that I want to talk to folks about some more, too, just like Vice Mayor Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| But I think on first reading I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| So right now we're voting on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| I'm sorry, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| I just, Teddy, I mean, how much time do you need to sort of adequately market this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| do the kinds of things you need to do in order to be, pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| So you're going to be behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| You're probably going to have to switch the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| We've got one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| We can postpone it to August 11th and then after that we can postpone it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| I can't really hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Take him to the microphone if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| You can give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Teddy Dyer, 8012 Coppock Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| If we got probably I can use August 11th and that would give me another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| And I talked to Renee from MDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We have to have it done by the end of August because the telethon is on TV, I think, first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| It's Labor Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Ms. Pillard, do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| It doesn't seem that that would give you the two weeks that you need because if we're going to call this a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| it's going to be pushing it by a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| I'm trying to get everything ready to go and then just have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| I can work without the chief about two or three days ahead of time when we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| May I suggest this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| It's obvious, Kelly, that we decide if you want to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| If you pass it, it passes on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| If the next time it gets amended substantially enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| then you'd have to decide whether you wanted to vote on it as emergency or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| If it doesn't get amended substantially enough to where it can count as a second reading, you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| But that, is that, Morris, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| That works good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Well, and I think if he knows, has a good feeling about this moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| it's just the locations you'll have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I don't think there's anybody here that doesn't want them to do the fill the boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| It's just a question of where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| I mean, we're going to try to go on with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| and just when we can get streets we can do it on while they won't place trucks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thanks, Teddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1416)|

| 0:24:36| President of the Forest Heights Homeowners Association of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| approval of a use on review for a home occupation answering telephones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1480)|

| 0:24:48| subject to conditions in an R1 low-density residential and R2 general residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| Property located on the north side of Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1494)|

| 0:25:01| applicant in conjunction with Resolution 11N,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Jenny Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| For counsel's information, we do have three people signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| I'm assuming you would want to hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Is that okay with counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| I'll give them an order, and then they can be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Jenny Nash, Terry Faulkner, and Finbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Go ahead, Jenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I'm Jenny Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I live at 606 Forest Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| I'm representing the Forest Heights Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| I think you're all pretty well aware of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| I just wanted to reiterate that our neighborhood, because it exists in proximity with businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| part of the Bearden Village, it's important to protect those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| And the boundary of Sutherland has been there, the north side of Sutherland, since the mid-'60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| So we'd just like to see that continued and have no business encroachment into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Also, at 4009, Ms. Hampton owns three salons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| She's a member of good standing in the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| but it seems that there's somewhere in those salons there could be a place to answer those phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| I'm Terry Faulkner, a Bearden resident at 4178 Bridgeway Lane, and it's 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| And I'm here representing the Bearden Council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| which is a group of neighborhood representatives from the Bearden neighborhoods, business folks, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| and we meet on a regular basis with our council representative in order to help implement the Bearden Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1601)|
| 0:26:49| which was a small area plan completed, passed upon by MTPC commissioners and city council in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1609)|
| 0:26:57| A major component of this plan was the effort to preserve the residential areas in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| And there was a natural boundary on Sutherland Avenue between Forest Hills Boulevard and Westwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| And that boundary was to have residential on the north side, on the south side commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| And both planners and residents of the neighborhood associations thought that was very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| And we are asking tonight that you continue to respect those boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| and not allow this home occupation business on the north side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| because within the boundaries of our neighborhood, that's the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| And once you set this precedent, it provides a pathway for others who might want to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| There's no reason to refuse another applicant if you do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| And it also places the burden of responsibility on the neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| and the residents to, every time this happens, to cope with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| and try to get the guidelines reinforced or enforced again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| So we would appreciate it if you support the Forest Heights Neighborhood Appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And thank you for everything you help us do in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Thanks, Terry. Fenbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you, Mayor and members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| I'm Fenbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| I live at 102 Heron Drive in Westwood, also in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| I, tonight, represent the Westwood Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and we are in total support of Jenny Nash's appeal or asking for your support of this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| As Terry said, the ordinances of either, excuse me, the zoning of R1 or R1E prohibit home office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1729)|
| 0:28:59| They're an R1E neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Westwood is R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| If you allow this, this could set an unhealthy precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Right now, there's a wonderful balance between residential, commercial, merchants, and we work well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| This could begin to change that balance in maybe not a healthy way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| We would very much appreciate it if you would support this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and deny the use of a home office in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them or anyone who's already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Is Ms. Hampton or anyone representing her here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| No, you need to come to the podium if you're going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1784)|
| 0:29:53| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| You'll have to go to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| My name is Sandra Hampton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| I reside at 4009 Sutherland Avenue, where I've resided since I've owned the house for a little over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1799)|
| 0:30:08| My daughter owned it previous to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| And I've lived there since May when I had been answering my phones there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| like at night after the business closed, having the calls forward there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| And after the trail and everything, we had some things happen there that, I mean, I'm right on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| I don't really feel that safe, so I moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| But once I was told that I was in violation and that that's what I needed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| that to apply for approval for a home occupancy, I needed to reside there, I did move back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| I had lived in West Knoxville for about three years since I had left there previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| and basically had used the place for some storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| There gets not ñ I've rented it a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| That's just kind of a hard thing to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| It's close to the road, so much traffic and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| But what I was approved for expires December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| I'm currently ñ I just absolutely ran out of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| And so I have leased more space and we started to build out or tear out today at Western Plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| to relocate a business to give us more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| And I think that in the exhibits that I showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| there should be the latest architect rendering showing our call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| showing a full call center in there, which is basically two phones and one to two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| But anyway, I would just ask that I would be able to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| until at which time my build-out has completed, which is slated for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| I was approved till December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| There's nothing different than what I've done there for four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Like I said, once cited, once I knew that I was in violation or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| I got the information and immediately applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and followed the criteria to have a home occupancy occupying 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| two small rooms, two phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| So anyway, I would just ask that I could continue that so I can go through that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Anyone speaking in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| We have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1936)|
| 0:32:27| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Don Hampton, 208 Marchmont Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And just two quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| They refer to this expulsion or expansion of offices down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| It runs eight-tenths of a mile from Forest Heights to Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| There's a total of nine homes left in eight-tenths of a mile, represents 16 percent of the road space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1969)|
| 0:32:58| Four of those homes are clustered at the end of Westwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| and they've got the panoramic view of Firestone Tire Store, the back of the CVS Pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| and a post office in a vacant lot with a crystal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| The next three houses, they've been decorated beautifully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| and it would be cost prohibitive for anybody to come in there and try to make offices out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| That leaves two houses, Sandra's and a stone house that seems to be perpetually for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| There's no room for that expansion or fear of expansion that they refer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| But lastly, more importantly, their own newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| It refers to Sandra as being less than honest, named her in their newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Third, they've got this plan they call the Traffic Common Plan, and I've seen that wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| Mr. Hampton, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| I'm not hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| So can you repeat those last comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I'd be more than glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| July 2007 newsletter of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| The second section, Traffic Common Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| They say halfway down, the ball is in our court now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| We need to talk to the six neighbors each corner lot at the entrances of Highlands, Forest Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| and Forest Hills about whether each of them is willing to donate three to five feet wide tracks to make room for medians to the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2062)|
| 0:34:33| Now, here's the catcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| It kills me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| This will signal to drivers that they're entering a neighborhood and to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| This tells me clearly what they think of the people on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Apparently, they don't consider them a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| They're just now entering one as they come up four sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| I really have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Those folks who were speaking in favor now have two minutes to, if anybody would like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2096)|
| 0:35:06| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Jenny Nash again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I wrote the newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| The traffic calming has to do with it's what Bill Coleman told me in terms of why medians at the entrance of the neighborhood communicates slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2110)|
| 0:35:25| So it's not that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| The reason we consider Sutherland part of our neighborhood, so does Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| That's part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I guess I'm not sure where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| I wrote the newsletter, and I apologize to Ms. Hampton about saying that she'd been less than honest with us about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2142)|
| 0:35:51| I think those were unfortunate words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| But certainly there has not been a coherent narrative about this in terms of we only just learned that she had moved back in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2154)|
| 0:36:04| because we knew that there had been a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| It was fairly obvious that there had been a business operating there for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| But at any rate, the traffic calming plan, the entrances are on hold because Ms. Hampton would have to agree to give up three to five feet at the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2172)|
| 0:36:23| And at this point, I'm not sure that she wants to hear the name Forest Heights Homeowners Association again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| So that's purely voluntary on the part of the owners of those homes at the entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| As far as I can, I mean, that has nothing to do with us not wanting any businesses in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| It's simply keeping the boundaries where the boundaries are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| So if you have any questions about that, I'm happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Right now there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Well, I'll make a motion that we uphold the appeal of the Forest Heights homeowners that was filed by Ginny Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| There's a motion and a second to uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Councilman, did you have something else, Ms. Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Yeah, Mayor Haslam, you know, we talk a lot about maintaining the integrity and character of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| And I think, you know, this is a classic example of where you really need to draw the line because neighborhoods are neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| We've got plenty of commercial space around for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| I do, however, I've said in the past that I think the language, the NPC guidelines, whatever, is somewhat weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| I like to uphold what we have on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| But as I look at the conditions that are put on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| I don't think there's any way that she could do what she wants to do and meet these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| So I'm going to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I do have another question to codes or to our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| How do we enforce, if someone is in violation of this, how do we enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| I need a cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| I mean, physically, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| The city issues citations, and if there's a violation, the city can seek injunctive relief to get an injunction against a violator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| I plan to support this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| I mean, not just here in Forest Heights, but this council has regularly and correctly over the years supported the lines of demarcation of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2303)|
| 0:38:34| whether it's Aliceville, Spring Hill area or Adair Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Forest Heights, likewise, falls into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| And I'm sure there are other examples throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I'm just accidentally forgetting, but I do plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Well, I was just going to comment in regard to the neighborhood issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| and confusing the traffic calming issue with the issue that's really before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| And I believe Mr. Hampton made a comment in regard to there were just six houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| and there was no way in the world that they were going to become businesses and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Actually, having spent some time meeting with some of these groups over the past, I guess I'd say, five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| I'm aware that a lot of interest has been given to this issue because there are some other properties that are being considered for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2359)|
| 0:39:29| and for purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And it is, at this point in time, a time when the neighborhoods can no longer overlook someone who is operating a business without the proper permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2371)|
| 0:39:42| So this has come to our attention simply because the neighbors have been trying to be good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| both to the residential properties and to the business properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| And it's just that now we have reached a point where there are some people interested in encroaching onto the north side of Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2395)|
| 0:40:05| And I think that is why this is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It's unfortunate for the Hamptons, and yet she has already indicated that she knows that she was operating there in violation of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2408)|
| 0:40:17| And so I think they understand that these are good folks that are just simply having to express their concerns for their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2417)|
| 0:40:26| And I think the traffic calming issue that came up in the newsletter is simply because the city is recognizing that it's very important for a number of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2426)|
| 0:40:36| that neighborhoods are well identified for people who are going to drive through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| both commercial people who must drive through and make deliveries and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and also for the neighbors who live there to respect their own neighbors and drive safely and drive carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| And so we've confused the two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| I don't think council is confused, but I think in a sense it's confused the two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| But I certainly understand the history behind the decision to request the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2459)|
| 0:41:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Well, I'm going to support the appeal also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Go back to what Councilman Frost said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I think that he made a good point that this council has consistently upheld neighborhood positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| There are, however, use on reviews for home occupation that have been approved by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| that have not been opposed by the surrounding communities and have, therefore, gone into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| And I can think of one that there's a great bakery that's been on Market Square every Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| and Saturday selling their goods, and they're in a neighborhood in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And they did their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| They talked to their neighbors, et cetera, and added an addition to their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| and got their use on review and had the support of their neighbors, and no one appealed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| So there is a way of doing this, and I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Yeah, Mayor, I just forgot to say one thing about Ms. Hampton, that this is not a reflection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| My vote is not a reflection on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I think she's in good standing, as someone said, in the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| and with a lot of her neighbors, and I just forgot to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| All those in favor of the motion, which was to uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Motion passes seven to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| Resolution 11A is a resolution authorizing Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| to prepare an amendment to the Gay Street Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| amending the boundary to include the 700 block of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and the 700 and 800 blocks of State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| and containing a provision for tax increment financing and to conduct a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Yeah, I've had some discussions with Bill about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| always had some concerns about how we sort of have some of downtown is covered by redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| and some isn't, and I think there's some concerns Bill expressed to me about slowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| I'd actually like to amend the boundaries to sort of be all of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| but some concerns Bill Lyons had about slowing up the process for the new Sentinel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| So I want to actually suggest an amendment that would say we're authorizing KCDC to prepare the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| that's covered in this, but also to ask KCDC to explore expanding the boundaries to cover all of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| that is not currently under a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I'd just like to hear Dr. Lyons' comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| We have discussed at times with the council the desirability of putting all of downtown in one redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| and there are a couple of reasons we haven't done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| One of them is that we always like to contact all property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| so they don't find themselves by surprise in a redevelopment area with all that that can entail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| which can be somewhat traumatic to people sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| And secondly, and probably a little less important because of the nature of these redevelopment areas downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| there are some varying purposes sometimes at work as to how they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| and what their goals are and the conditions upon which certain things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| But I would say that there are a few scattered parts of downtown that are not in redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| It would be nice to put them all in to keep from coming back all of the time because many of the issues arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| As Councilman Becker said, we discussed not wanting, and I appreciate his stating it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| not wanting to hold up this particular expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| But to ask KCDC to look into that and explore what that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| I don't think that would be anything that wouldn't be worthwhile, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Was yours actually a motion, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Okay, it was an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| That's what I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| And then it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Councilman Bailey seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And I think that the motion is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| I think we should ask them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I'm just not clear as to whether or not it would be consistent to include that in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| And why can't we just not ask the administration and Mr. Lyons to ask KCDC to do that so that we don't have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| issues sitting in here and KCDC wondering which is priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| You know, looking at the boundaries or redirecting this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| I think maybe we don't want to muddy the waters and make this a clean document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| and make this a formal request from Council that the administration inquire, ask KCDC to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| And if that's not enough, we can have a resolution at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| I would hate to put these two issues in there and just muddy the waters and make it cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| Councilman Becker, you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| I don't feel strongly either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| I mean, if there is a feeling that this muddies the water, I don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| I mean, we want to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| But I'm also just, in the time I've been here, we've expanded boundaries, we've created new, and I just want to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| I think we can accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| I don't think anybody from the administration is going to say no to the request here from Council that you also ask KCDC to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| without putting it in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| No objection, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Bill, I think we're okay either way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| I mean, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| We're perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| And we have discussed this with KCDC, so we can just go back to them and on the way, you know, in more informal basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| but just as binding, say, would you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Because we're just asking to explore anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| So go ahead and explore that and report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I would probably feel better to keep this one, to keep them separate if I had my choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| And you all will go ahead and make that request to KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Councilman Becker's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I'll go ahead and withdraw the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Mr. Becker, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Then we're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| But we understand the intent, and obviously we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| Any other comments then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| 11B is a resolution approving a contract with Church Street Management, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| and authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| necessary to acquire a tract of real property owned by Church Street Management, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| for a purchase price of $1,850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Okay, there is one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| He's signed up to speak and neither for or against, but explaining, is Mr. John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| Sometimes I wonder about my own explanations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| They sometimes serve to confuse rather than enlighten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| I hope this is not one of those occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| I'm John King, PO Box 2425 in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| here representing American Accessories International, Church Street Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| and Eric Zena, owners of the property that is the subject of a proposed transit center by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| And I felt it important to come here, Mr. Mayor and members of council, somewhat constrained to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| so that there is no misunderstanding or misconception as this matter goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| There is no currently binding agreement with the city to acquire this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2895)|
| 0:48:24| By letter of June 1, 2007, which was a Friday, which letter we got on Monday, June the 4th of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2904)|
| 0:48:34| the city advised us of its offer of $1,850,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| and told us that our deadline for response was Wednesday, June the 6th, essentially two working days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2920)|
| 0:48:50| The alternative, we were told, was the pursuit by the city of condemnation and taking the property by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| That offer stated that time was of the essence in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| and that the project had been delayed, stating in essence that that delay was somehow caused by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| Accordingly, the demand we faced was you agree by the 6th or the property would be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| We responded to that by acquiescing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| We submitted an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| It was a written document prepared by the city law department agreeing to the acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| At the city's request, the closing date for that acquisition was to be on or before July 3, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2969)|
| 0:49:40| That date has come and gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| The agreement was to have been on council's agenda on June the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| On Monday the 18th, we received a call from the law department advising that the city needed a postponement for two to three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| to get some paperwork in order for FTA and the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| That particular item was postponed for the meeting of the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| It has now been four weeks since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| As of yesterday, by virtue of a newspaper article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| and my attendance of a meeting last evening at 530 on environmental assessment on this particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| and a meeting that I initiated by me with the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| we are now told it will be an additional four to eight weeks before FTA action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| and that the city will not close until after that action has been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| Based upon the status of matters in June when we were informed what our options were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| and after that other assurances from the city, we located and contracted for a replacement location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3049)|
| 0:50:58| A substantial consideration and the acceptance of my clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| and its response to the city's demand was that the closing was to occur in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| because that gave us the money which was then to be deposited at interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| so as to be earning additional funds to help defray the cost and expense of moving and related relocation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3075)|
| 0:51:24| Every day that goes by without our receipt of those funds represents a monetary loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| and detriment to my client that was not within the contemplation of the parties at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| the agreement was agreed to and proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| It now appears that we are 30 to 45 days away from closing and payment at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3103)|
| 0:51:52| We've been in virtually an untenable position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Everything has worked to our detriment even to the point of the possibility that our replacement location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| which has its own closing date, may not be available to us at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| when the city finally gets its approvals in order and agrees to enter into this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| I know of nothing to say to you but we want an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| We want an agreement with the city in accordance with its demands of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| We want such an agreement with a firm, fixed date for closing so that we can decide whether to accept or refuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3146)|
| 0:52:34| The sooner the closing, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| We've been put at risk by the city from start to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| We have tried to respond in a responsible, businesslike fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| We have not, if you will, taken to the position of going to war over this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3165)|
| 0:52:55| But our current position is not of our making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| and we're pushed into taking positions by the actions of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| and the delay being as a result of the city's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3181)|
| 0:53:10| I say all this and, as the mayor pointed out, I'm not speaking for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| I would hope that in light of these comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| the council can understand the frustration and the concern of my client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| and the fact that a substantial sum of money that was expected to be part of this overall transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| is just going away day by day by day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| We would urge upon the city and the city administration to please get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| and get there as quickly as possible because every day that goes by is just more money lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| and more detriment sustained by my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Any questions, anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Let me just speak to Mr. King, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| There is nobody, believe me, that wants to close this quicker than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| On the other hand, I can't commit the city's money to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| when we don't have FTA's approval to fund the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| It's just not prudent to do it on behalf of the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| and I don't think that you all would vote to do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| We very much understand the situation that Mr. King's client is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| On the other hand, I think we've been very fair in the offering and the financial dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Quite frankly, this is a factor of working with FTA, like any federal agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| is not the easiest thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| And they can sometimes go one direction and then call a timeout and we're at their mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| And we are following the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| We had a meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I still think that this is not just the best site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| but quite frankly the only site that we have a chance of getting built while any of us are with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| I honestly think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| And while I'm, like I said, nobody wants to close this faster than we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| I'm just not going to put the city's money at risk until we have an agreement with FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| And I think we have a, we've negotiated a very fair price with Mr. King's client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| And we are, believe me, the minute we can close, we will close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| I can't expose the city until we have the agreement with the FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| Let's just try to get it done as quickly as possible for the benefit of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Believe me, I'm glad we don't have to pay Mr. Kaiser or Dr. Lyons by the hour for the amount of time they are working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| It's just about all they're doing full time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3327)|

| 0:56:05| Requested by policy development and Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Excuse me, Council Member Hookless, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Council Member Frost, what do you foresee at the end of the four-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Just a review, maybe renewing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| What's your thinking on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I won't be here in four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| But somebody will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| What's your thinking on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Well, it's specifically timed to end with more than likely this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| and the remaining members of Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| and at that point we'd allow the next administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| and the next members of the City Council to decide if it's worthwhile in going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| I will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| I think it's a nice one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| It is good when we do this to have some sort of sunset provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We can go back and measure the financial impact at that time and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| So I actually applaud having a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| I'm not arguing on that date, but just that there be a date I think is wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3427)|

| 0:57:13| 11D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| and deliver an agreement with Summit Medical Group, PLLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| to provide medical services to City of Knoxville employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| and to retirees and spouses who are members of the City's medical insurance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Yeah, I just have a clarifying question for, I guess, Director Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| In conversations with some city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| they've been under the impression that the cost for going to the center is their impression has been it's $5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| if you're on the city health plan and it's $25 if you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| My understanding is it's actually the $5 fee is if you have gotten the health assessment done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| And I just want to sort of get clear on the difference of the nominal fee of going to the center for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| Council Member Becker, the way it's based is there's a $25 copay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| You get a $20 discount if you become a member of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| To become a member of the center, you participate in a health assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| That is applicable to any employee, full-time employee, whether they're on the insurance plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Ms. Fiddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| You know, I think it would only be fair to say that I've more or less expressed to all of you some concerns I have about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| changes that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And while I certainly hope this is going to serve our employees in the very best way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| and I understand the educational component of the plan and the reason that those changes are being made by the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3527)|
| 0:58:57| I just really am going to kind of plead with you for very good oversight of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| I just, Mr. Martin and I have talked and we have emailed each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| In regard to some of my concerns, my personal life is sort of involved with health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| And it has allowed me to have some observations of where health care is going today, some of the groups and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| And I just want to be sure that we don't get caught up in some of the sales pitch of those possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3565)|
| 0:59:35| without really keeping in mind that the employees are the important component here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| and their needs and the manner in which we can best reach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| So I think this is going to be new ground for Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| And I see Tim out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| He's a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| And so I feel like, you know, we're in good hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| But on the other hand, this is a whole new little game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| and it involves an entirely different aspect of health care providing than I believe you have been involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3603)|
| 1:00:14| And so I hope it will be a good learning experience for the city, a good experience for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| But I do have my reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| I'm going to support it, of course, because I understand the groups that have worked through a lot of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| and come to the conclusion that this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| I think one thing that concerns me for both the city and the Summit group is the three-year contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| because I just wonder if it's going to look as good three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| And, you know, some of us won't be here to even have a strong voice in making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| But I felt it would be disingenuous if I didn't make those comments publicly, because privately I've been very vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3658)|
| 1:01:09| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3669)|

| 1:04:54| Just, well, it won't be particularly quick, but we'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| I think this is a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| I think it's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I've got a couple questions for Mr. Donaldson, more for public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| One is it feels like in reading this we've put a little more focus on implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| and sort of not just having a plan but having ways to accomplish the plan, and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| you to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| And this is, as I understand it, sort of more a model for how we're going to be doing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| plans in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| And if you can go over that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| And then I also wanted to ask you about the Appendix D in this, which is sort of a chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| of looking at ideal zoning violations or ideal zones as development happens, and to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| a little more about how that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| It seems like it's another way we're doing things in the future and, to my mind, doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Well, if I might, I'll start with Appendix D, which is a set of proposed new land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| classifications, which is our first effort at trying to bring together the land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3949)|
| 1:05:59| and terminologies that are used in the one-year plan alongside those that are used in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| sector plans, both in the city and the county, and to organize them in a way that highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3964)|
| 1:06:14| some of their locational criteria as far as when we would use a recommended zone and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| other zones could also be considered and what other factors ought to be considered with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| those other zones if you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| It's also a bridge towards moving from a more use-oriented zoning ordinance, such as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3989)|
| 1:06:38| current one, to a more form-based or design-oriented sections of ordinances, such as the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=3998)|
| 1:06:46| Waterfront, and trying to hone in on where a form-based code is appropriate under what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| circumstances, and trying to put that in an understandable form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| I think the Appendix D in its matrix format works pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| I hope that you all become familiar with it, and we may need to have a workshop or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| something like that at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| We've got the West City Sector Plan following closely on the heels here, so you'll see its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| application there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| This particular plan has built within it a small area plan for the Fountain City area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| which probably makes it look more action-oriented, because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| There are some very specific actions that were requested from the citizenry as a result of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| A huge focus on sidewalks, walkability, and connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| And in conjunction, we're about to go public with the City-County Parks Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| So we've been doing a lot of surveying about park needs, and there are some very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| recommendations regarding parks in the North City Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| There are some very strong statements about recommendations and actions, so we've tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| provide you a framework for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| And to get to some of the new zoning classifications that we are talking about in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| matrix, some general rezonings are required to make that happen, so we've tried to lay those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| out for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4121)|

| 1:08:46| Just as a follow-up, I know Mr. Donaldson suggested a workshop at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| I'd be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| I think this is a new way of thinking about some of our land use classifications, and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| could explore it in more detail at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4136)|

| 1:11:36| Just for clarification, Mr. Kaiser, emergency ordinance takes six votes in the affirmative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Regardless of the number of who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| There's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Did I hear all ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| Did anybody vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| I heard no no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Mr. Becker, did I take your abstaining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Did everybody else vote aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| I heard six ayes, zero no's, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| The motion is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Now we're supposed to be on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Abstentions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| And it is adopted on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| 12D is an ordinance to rezone property from C3 General Commercial District to C4 Highway and Arterial Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| Property located on the north side of Asheville Highway, northwest of South Rugglesberry Pike, City of Knoxville applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| I've heard from both Mr. and Mrs. Sherrod who own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Apparently the city made an honest mistake when this property was annexed as to what the proper zoning designation it should have been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4382)|
| 1:13:11| Until it's rezoned, they have someone to rent their property, but they can't move in because the current zoning does not have the use that their tenant would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4391)|
| 1:13:23| And the new zoning wouldn't allow them to have that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| So, likewise, I'll ask for Council's indulgence to make this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Different light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Different light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| There's a motion to hear this on an emergency basis in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Any discussion as to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I heard six ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| I guess I just have a concern with our long-range thinking on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| Right now, I still remember Asheville Highway as this long stretch between the city and Helmus, you know, the four-way out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| and some concern about how it's developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| I do not want to see Asheville Highway turned into another version of some of the highways that, yes, I wasn't going to say that, Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| And I guess in a little bit, some of the thinking that Mr. Donaldson laid out of the Appendix D in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| a little more thinking about nodal development that would work on this as a way to develop this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| And I just hope in the long run we can develop Asheville Highway in a way that works for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Mr. Emmett's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| I talked to Rick Emmett earlier on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Rick, could you explain what the misunderstanding was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| Because I do, to some degree, share Councilman Becker's concerns about what happens long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| but apparently we'd balance that with sort of what the expectations were by the party that owns this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4502)|
| 1:15:11| in terms of how they were going to come into the city with what zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| Could you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| I don't know if they're here or not, but could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Rick Emmett, 400 Main Avenue, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| This was an annexation that occurred probably four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| It was a large area annexation, which we don't do a lot of those these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| but we did a large area annexation at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| The county only has two zones for commercial, CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| The CA zone in the county allows a lot of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| This property is surrounded by construction companies, I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| Our process through the city is to apply through the planning commission for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| When it comes in the city, it has a no zone designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Then we leave it up to the NPC to decide what the proper zone will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| My application actually says no zone to comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| The planning commission, as I have come to find out, basically looks at the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| and tries to determine what a comparable zone will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Well, the construction company fit in a C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| It's right next to this small piece of property the property owner has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| So they assumed, I think, that the construction company had the entire piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| and since that fit the CA in the county, they gave everything C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| We didn't find out about it until about six months or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| when the property owner tried to get a new tenant in there who came to get a business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| went to the business tax office and found that he didn't have the correct zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| Then the property owner went to inspections to try to find out, you know, what do I need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| found out there's a lot of differences between C3 and C4 in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| The C4 is what he should have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| and so had he had C4 originally as what he probably should have had, then we wouldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| Because what happens now, trying to go through another rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| he has to jump through a lot of hoops to get to C4 when he would have been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| grandfathered in and some other things then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| The other thing is the property owners at that time in a large area typically are aware of what's going on a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4633)|
| 1:17:23| We're more in contact today with property owners than we were four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| And I try to explain that to folks when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| If you have a zoning, find out what zone you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| Let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Let me talk to MPC and try to get that worked out on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| It didn't happen as much back in those days, and I think that's some of the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| So, essentially, if we did not approve C4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| we would be saying you can't continue to do what you've been doing is the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| And that's typically when folks come in the city, we always try to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| we're not trying to deny you what you were doing before you came to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| We want you to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| The property owner is here if there's questions there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| It was on consent at MPC, so I take it that no one opposed the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Well, I'm a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| I actually had a conversation with Mr. Donaldson today about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| I'm sort of a little concerned about, Mr. Emerson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| you say, you know, the property owner can tell me what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| and I'll go advocate for the zone they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| And I'm a little worried about an attitude there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| I probably misstated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| What I tell them is if you have a particular zone you want that is a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| of the range of zones we have, send me a letter to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| I'll attach it to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| We still don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| We don't advocate for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| You scared me a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| That gives the planners a chance to know what the property owner wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| so maybe they can ask those questions that need to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| I guess we're voting on the amendment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| I heard six ayes and one no unless somebody corrects me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Now we're going back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4743)|

| 1:22:35| How you doing there, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4955)|
| 1:22:50| I'm about ready for you at that next run, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I'm getting in darn good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4972)|

| 1:22:59| We're going to take you all on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| We're going to take you on with the Mayor's health incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Help y'all trim up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| Mr. Mayor, I know I'll be out of line a little bit talking about County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| I told County Commission to start having their meetings in the evening where citizens could take part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| They stay at home eating, about ready to go to bed, you know, when y'all working late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| And y'all go to work sometime earlier than they do, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| So they're not really concerned about the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| One time I thought Mayor Ransdell might make a pretty good U.S. Senator or U.S. Congressman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| But today I think he a lame duck in every area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Because, you know, we sit here when white supremacists came to Knoxville last month, everybody all up in arms, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5020)|
| 1:23:50| Well, I'm here to tell you we got white supremacists right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| They didn't have to come from Cincinnati or anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| They're right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| You go down to the other end of that hallway on that sixth floor, you know, a guy like me sitting around looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| I'm saying white supremacists are down there in the County Mayor's office because they're trying to crucify Mrs. Bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5046)|
| 1:24:14| They're not trying to crucify John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| They accept his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| If you guys went out and spent that much money on alcohol, man, who in the world are y'all getting drunk with to spend, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5059)|
| 1:24:28| But I'm saying if he's going to send it to the comptroller, if he's going to send it to Randy Nichols, our Attorney General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| he didn't investigate the woman on the cruise ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Said nobody, if you're going to punish one, you ought to punish all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| Because every one of them spent some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| But it seemed to me they're taking that black woman and they're trying to let her be a pawn for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| You know, his quote is, Mary Ransdell's quote, all we folk out there, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| Yeah, you're right, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| But everybody I've heard and seen is in a leadership position, Ms. Pelow, that say that, they always set themselves up for disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5099)|
| 1:25:07| You go all the way back to 1973 with President Nixon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| When he said the buck stopped with him, he had Watergate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| And, you know, I'm a military guy and I support President Bush, but you know what he got on that aircraft carrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| and he said the buck stopped with him now that he put a Republican Party about to fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| And we still got the war in Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| And that same thing with Mary Ransdell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Soon as he said the buck stopped here, he looked like John Warner did a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| He saved us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Well, did the other women, did they do a good job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Well, if they didn't do a good job, how could she be there from, like, 05 to the present before all this came about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Well, if she didn't do her job, that means Senator Fentz didn't do her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| I'm waiting on Senator Fentz to give us her resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Because, you know what, Ms. Pelow, I believe if I'm wrong, I'll stop coming up here speaking after tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| because I know those women are good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| And there was more friendship going on than county work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| There was more personal stuff going on than county work on county time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| Now, some of you may know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Y'all can read between the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| I'm not going to point out no organization or nobody else tonight, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| But I'm telling you, she told that woman to do a lot of that junk verbally, and it was all cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| It wasn't the only time it became uncool when it all came to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| She was walking around with her hands clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Mayor Ransdell, after I came up here two weeks ago, he finally gave her a letter of reprimand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| For what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| She ought to be putting her paperwork in just like John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| Whether she spent $187 at Club LeCocq or wherever she spent it, who she spent that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| Then you got the woman with the cruise ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| I mean, she lied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| She sat there and said that she had permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Come to find out, the mayor gets up and says she didn't have permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| What about that, Councilman Woodhoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| And then what they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Her and Diane John, them, they're out there chilling out at Regas on my tax dollars eating lobster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| And then what the disappointing point about that is, Councilman Bailey, they took some of it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| They ordered an extra plate to take home on taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| And then you know what Mayor Ransdell do to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Give her another job over there with sense defense so they can keep running a messed up department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| All of them need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Mayor Ransdell needs to go back tomorrow morning after his communications director sees this program tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| and go in there and tell sense defense you need to go home too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| In our loyalty, everybody always talks about loyalty, Chief, and you know about loyalty on the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5267)|
| 1:27:54| I know about loyalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| I'm loyal to Mr. Anderson if I feel I need to be loyal to Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| I'm loyal to those who I feel I ought to be loyal to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| My loyalty just don't go to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| And I tell you what, he brought them in office with him five years ago, Councilman Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| and you know what, before they let all that jump on him like that, the mayor, all of them should have resigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| because he brought them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| If they had his back, they all would have resigned before they ever got this far out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| They got that county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| They want to sit there, their committee, intergovernmental, they want to prosecute somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| And they love to keep saying this woman's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| Say no white guy's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Because they wear a nice suit, say their names too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| They need to go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| If not go to jail, they want me to have a criminal record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| That's five minutes, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Give me two more, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| I'm out of here because you know what, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| I have a good one for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Mr. Becker just gave you two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Hey, you know, I'm on a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| Five points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Mr. Merritt, it could be a good venture if you sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Leroy Thompson came back in the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| He was good with the white guys, and he ripped us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Oh, I tell it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| I don't hang out with any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| They ain't going to call me tomorrow morning, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| But he ripped off the black community when he backstabbed John Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| Y'all may say it's something else, but I know it backstabbed John Davis, a man of valor in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| This guy just came back in, and he got in with Bob Talbot and them, and, man, and they moved him right on up the ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| I respect everybody, but when they did that, I could call them all a bunch of dirty crooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Because today the city is stuck with, you know, and y'all put the taxpayer paid $5.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| And then the county paid another million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| So now y'all finished up Pastor Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| I have nothing against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| But I'm saying all proceeds of that venture need to go back into the city coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| Leroy Thompson do not deserve not one dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| He should not have no capital gain in that venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| All that money should go back to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| He didn't buy that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Leroy Thompson got up here before y'all granted them that extra million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| I know some of y'all remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Man, I got a memory like a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| That guy got right up here at the same podium, Mr. Mayor, and said he gave up $900,000, Mr. Anderson, out of his pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| Well, I went to the city recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| I pulled all the amendments, all the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| I went to Ms. Madeline's department and talked to one of the guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| When you go in the office down the hall like hers on the left-hand side, I forget his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| and could nobody show me nothing in black and white where Leroy Thompson put up $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| I'm still waiting to see that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Fifteen more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| All right, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Lastly, Mr. Mayor, if y'all are going to build up half a highway, don't forget Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Y'all done cut us off on one part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Y'all made it Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| That's cool, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| But, you know, y'all going to keep letting them put Molly Potts stores on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| Let us look like Redston Knoxville these next four years you got, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Don't leave us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| And lastly, we still want some sidewalks on Harrison and Louise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| I don't believe I'll need five minutes when I read this in front of my bathroom mirror today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5474)|
| 1:31:23| I think I went through about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| I was in a bit of a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Mr. Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| I'm David Williams, born and raised in the Pond Gap area, 505 Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| I still live within about 300 feet from where I was born, so my roots run very deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| Tonight I'd like to speak about a cause, and I probably believe other neighborhoods have this cause as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| Everyone should be concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| We have a problem, and it's really not of our doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| The troublemakers, some act out of ignorance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| About a third are due to the misdeeds of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| And history has a way of taking note of injustices, and the righteous almighty will judge according to his purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| So after a lot of prayer, we're not going to curse the darkness, but we're going to try to shed some light on a possible solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| And tonight we're going to begin by starting some education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| This is a wonderful venue of neighborhood compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| We've got a wonderful mayor who cares about neighborhoods, a like-minded council, and others, those watching on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| So I can think of no better place to unveil our Pond Gap Neighborhood Association's cut-out, cut-through traffic on Hollywood campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5539)|
| 1:32:31| The dear lady that does our community newsletter did this, and she has to take the credit for it, not I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| Well, what in the world is cut-through traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| If you come to our neighborhood to live or work or go to school or play or shop to visit us, you're more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| That's not cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| If you're just in an almighty hurry to get from point A to point B and you're just buzzing through our neighborhood, usually speeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| that's cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| And we wish you would have some respect for neighborhoods like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Well, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| We know this causes a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| A lot of noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| We've got congestion and air pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| In fact, I had to clean my eyes out several times before I came down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| I can't even sit on my front porch with all this traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Well, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| Well, we're going to take a pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| The folks in my neighborhood are going to do our best not to cut through your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| and we would like for you not to cut through our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| I was coming down here today, I was very conscious of where I went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| If it takes me an extra ten minutes to go somewhere, I want to spend the extra ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| I'm going to learn about other neighborhoods and respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| And I think if we have enough caring people, we'll succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Having no further business to come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070717?start=5625)|
