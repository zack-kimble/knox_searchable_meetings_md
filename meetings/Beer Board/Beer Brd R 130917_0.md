| 0:01:46| Sergeant Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| The only name listed on the application that we had received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| As far as the background checks with us, mr. Hill, and he had no applicable record. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Gaines has not been in for processing. So Trevor Hill is going to be the actual manager that will be selling the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| I'm the one that applied for the fundraising organization with the 501 c3. Okay, so I'm the one running the fundraiser. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| What's the rule on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| It's a special event. I mean he's here as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Representing the nonprofit that I guess is the not guessing it is the applicants, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| I think he would he would be a fine represent an acceptable representative. Okay, does he have to have the records check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| Since the manager of the event does have the records check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| For a special event permit sergeant hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| I'm not sure if they're listed as owner or manager on the application. They have to submit to fingerprint and background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=160)|
| 0:02:49| So the next time that that would be done is this Thursday, correct, that's correct what time we take appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| You just have to call the the inspections unit and we could set an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| As long as you showed up to the appointment and brought two forms of ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| We can conduct the background checks then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| We'll come back to that in just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Miss Dyers, what about the file? The file is complete. Okay, the issue is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| Records check you don't have to have the task training just the records check and that could be done this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Which precedes the event now, let me be real clear about this event. It is scheduled. It's called rage fest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| Yes, ma'am the hill and it's on September 21st. What time does it start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| It's gonna start at a four o'clock the office the off-duty officers are coming at 330 for the street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| Okay, it's gonna go until 10 o'clock outside and continues inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| But we're gonna open up the barricades on the streets and everything and the officers are gonna leave at 11 when the outdoor closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Okay, let's let's back up and put it in reverse a minute the street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| Tell me about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| So we're only closing the dead-ended part of the street. I've already talked to the civil engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| I have to provide them with one little drawing which I've talked to a Tony van de Graaff who is the civil engineer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| So we're 12th and forest star. It'll be open for all moving traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| We're literally just closing how the hill backs up with that parking lot that they use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| So we're actually not closing where cars drive. We're only closing where cars would normally park to go to the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| Okay, that is a public street though. Yes, ma'am. Okay, and you understand that there can be no beer on that public street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| We thought that the alcohol permit was for the street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| And we'd be able to serve now the alcohol is permit is only for the venue itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Not the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| We actually already have an alcohol permit for the venue the way we understood is that we needed one for the street itself to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Able to serve alcohol and that's what we were told by the business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Mr. Frost do you want to step in? Thank you. You all have applied for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| To have a street closure where alcohol is served in this circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| You have to be located within the confines of the Central Business Improvement District, which is defined in city code 2-10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=294)|
| 0:05:04| 7-3 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| To play it safe. I had engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Create a map which shows that the proposed street closure is outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| The CB ID so you all could not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| the alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| in the streets or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| the good news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| For you all on the other hand as long as you all operate within the confines of the hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| Beer permit that's already in place, sir. You don't need a special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| permit and in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| City code doesn't allow two permits for one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| But since the hill already has its permit in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| They can host the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| For you and make whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| That were discussed or arranged that's perfectly fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| So I guess where the confusing part comes in we were told that we needed an alcohol permit and we were allowed to which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Fine that we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| So would we be able to get our application fees back because we were paid money because we were told we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| And that money is coming out of the fundraising that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Find it here, but there actually is a city code section that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| prohibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Refunding I'm sure there is I was just wondering if misinformation would allow for a different circumstance because the only reason I haven't filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| This permit is because I was told that I had to buy the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| I would not have filed this city told you that you had to have a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| We talked to the business tax office. So Juan today, I guess was who we talked to you about all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| Okay, who's the one who did the talking to miss day Trevor Hill and myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| All right, miss day, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Not sure that this is all exactly there's been a lot of going around in circles with this application miss day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| Well, I know initially when they came in and spoke with my co-workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| I was on vacation that week, but I don't think anyone our office would have told him they had to close the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| They were applying because we never tell anyone that they have to have a permit for a special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| That is strictly up to the applicant themselves. I'm not talking about special events. I'm literally just discussing about the alcohol permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| I know we need a special events permit in street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| We were planning on that no matter what whether or not we could sell alcohol in the street just to provide room for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| You know people come in and listen to music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| the thing that was confusing to us was that we were told that we need an alcohol permit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| We were under the impression that we were going to be able to sell alcohol in the streets when we close that Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| It's fine that we aren't once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| but the only reason we paid the hundred dollar application fee was because we were under the impression that we would be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| You can have the you know, assuming you get your permit for your street closure, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| People can be there, but they just can't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Alcohol, right, right. I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| we just would have never filed for the alcohol permit in the first place if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Knew that because the hill already had one and this is going to be at the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| We thought we needed one for people to drink in the street and we were under the impression that it was necessary to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| One for people to do that and we were never told that people would be unable to drink in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| Even if we got one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| So now that we know that we would have never filed it and spent $100 which is coming directly out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| Fundraising money from the camp. That's the only thing that I'm discussing at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| Well, according to the application you spent $50 for a special one-day event permit right and $25 for a background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=506)|
| 0:08:34| So that's 75, so I'm not sure what a publication fee of 25 you're right. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| so those fees are typically not refundable if you do get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Permit for the street closure, then you will need this permit that we're considering tonight. Awesome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| Okay, my apologies on the confusion. I'm new to all of this. Well, it is confusing sometimes. Yeah, I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Vice mayor Pavlis. This is in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Yeah, I'm confused here as to when you say the confines of his business I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| This gentleman to walk away knowing exactly where he where he can and cannot sell beer because this this is a disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| Waiting to happen. I mean, I can just tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| You'll be recognized but I want him to know exactly where he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| At the hill it allows them to be inside the building and also on the the properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| Fenced-in area and on the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| One thing that I wanted to ask which is there so we did Fort Sanders fest two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| I don't know if anybody remember that we actually fenced off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| The parking lot on the other side using barricading and they were able to drink there that year because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| Would that be a feasible situation as long as it didn't spill into the street if we turned it into a walkway from the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| the reason why that that that was permitted that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Basically seen as a an extension of the patio or creating a patio on the other side of the building as long as it's contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| To the building and meets the other requirements set forth in section 4-58 section e| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Spells out what the barrier needs to be as long as you meet meet those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Requirements and I'd be happy to meet with you afterwards and give you a copy of it. That'd be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Are we ready to oh, I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| All right, I just want to ask this young gentleman this this camp Konami. This is the the camp for handicapped kids in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| so they have the one week long camp in the spring and then they have two short camps in the fall and one and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| Through the therapeutic recreation department at University of Tennessee. I actually work these camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| and I've you know, I've worked them for a little while and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| You're raising money to help that program continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| They always end up a few thousand dollars in the negative which they use to provide scholarships to people with multiple disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| So my camper last year would have been unable to come without a scholarship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| and so the money that I'm raising is essentially to provide the ability for maybe those children that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Would not normally be able to come because their parents can't afford it. So these are for scholarships for those very worthy cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| I just oh, yes, sir. Yeah, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Gala that is held the next week. It's $75 a person. Does that money also provide scholarships or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| Does that money so camp K has well over six figures of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| So we have a golf tournament or they have I guess I don't run those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| They have a golf tournament every year that I Bruce Pearl helps with they have the gala| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| And they have a couple other smaller events and they still ended up I think it was thirty nine hundred dollars negative last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| So essentially what I'm doing is I'm trying to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Like these every couple months to help curb just the smaller cost that they might miss here and there to provide scholarships for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=709)|

| 0:11:59| it's specifically prohibited for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Granted outside the CBI D. I respectfully submit. There's nothing to vote on because we can't grant or deny a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| permit such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Excuse me, you need to give your name and address, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| Is there a difference between the central business district and the central business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| CBI D as you called it. It's central business improvement district. It's so when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| Got the building rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=755)|
| 0:12:35| I think about seven years ago spent two years in front of the City Council doing it and they zoned it into the CBD it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| Is the corner of it and was specifically zoned into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| It now does not count as being in the CBD a CBI D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| I've got a the CBI D is actually defined by City Ordinance 2 dash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| 1073 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| created a map last week that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| shows that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Your building is not within the CBI D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| I wonder if the positive that it is and I still have the transcripts suspect two long years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| In front of the City Council to get it into the central business district or CBI D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| That's not a matter that the beer board is addressing right now. What we're addressing right now is this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Since we do not have a special event on the way tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| You know if you get a permit to close the street as long as you don't drink in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Then is that right sergeant hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| We applied assuming it was in the CBD because it was zoned by the City Council into the CBD and it's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| This is the beer board. This is not the City Council. So we're not looking at the CBI D. Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| Sergeant I mean, mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| He just said that it was not in the CBD and I'm sure that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| So if it's in the CBI, excuse me, sir, you're very much out of order now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| You can either stand there or you can sit down or you can leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Those are your options. Thank you. All right. We have nothing to vote on at this point. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| Okay, they have a permit for beer. So the event can occur there. You just can't be in the street with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| Can I ask one question though, yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| So say post actually from this meeting that it turns out that the transcripts do prove that it is in the CBI D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| Would there be any way to bring those and show that it's within the district if it is I'm sure you might be right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| I've got my city code here because I was just looking up the last time it was revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=872)|

| 0:14:41| Ordinance and mrs. Mitchell can help me that is o dash 5 1 5 dash 9 2 and I would suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| Ending in dash 9 2 means it was in 1992, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| So there would be no way if it did somehow be in the district if he could find that that we'd be able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| Tomorrow and bring that to you. No because the beer board means tonight does not meet again till October 15th. We meet once a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=898)|

| 0:24:46| To talk about that. I do know that there is a movement statewide to get the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| To do some fine-tuning to the law so that these things can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| Concurrently instead of consecutively because it it's not working out the way it was intended to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| I understand, you know, we've already we've already served our time at the ABC. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1503)|

| 0:25:12| Well, we have to send it to an administrative hearing and this is a hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| You'll get paperwork for that and then you need to tell the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1515)|

| 0:25:27| You submitted a remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1527)|

| 0:25:58| given by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And likewise when the city beer board revokes or suspend somebody's permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| State law requires us to notify the state ABC who in turn are supposed to go through the same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1566)|

| 0:26:26| implemented that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| It hasn't worked out too well with local governments throughout the state and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| Unfortunately what the state laid down is what we're having to work with sir. Okay, I mean, that's that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1595)|

| 0:28:12| Amazingly that person showed up the second time for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| So we now have a new game plan and it looked to me like you were far more serious. Tell us about it. Well, um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1695)|

| 0:28:42| well, I will say that for the most part the beer board has in the past not been thrilled when somebody's fired because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| There are ways to correct those mistakes now in your new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| You have made some substantive changes in the way you're going to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| I see that you do have an ID scanner in place the cash register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Requires a manual date insertion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1742)|

| 0:29:11| Okay, you check the ID at the door. It's checked again and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| Councilman Saunders is working there that night and he serves the person and it goes to an underage person. Do you have any okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1757)|

| 0:30:04| We can send it on for an administrative hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| With a suspension revocation hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| So is it the pleasure of the board to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Hope we don't see them again, or is it the pleasure of the board to send them on vice mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| I'm just curious the machine that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| So, how does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| How does it read or it reads from the like on your it'll have to be of course like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| state issued ID card or Tennessee driver's license and it just reads it from I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| Guess like the little barcode thing on the back. Not the barcode, but the you know the little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| It reads it from that so we can't accept any other kind of lock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Is there a pad electronic like little patch there or something on the back these days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| so I guess another question is is that the only form of ID that will we recognize for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1850)|
| 0:30:59| Couldn't have like a military or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1859)|

| 0:31:17| accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Multiple IDs like you know military whatever. It's just that you know it will tell them yes, or no either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1878)|
| 0:31:27| And out of curiosity is it the price and I won't get into your business here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| But is it from five hundred dollars is it over or under that price right? It's about three times that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130917?start=1891)|
