| 2:54:42| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10484)|
| 2:54:45| 11L is an ordinance to rezone property located at 2910 and 2912 Greenway Drive from RN1F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10485)|
| 2:54:53| District to RN2F District and to rezone property located at 3000 Greenway Drive from RN1F HP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10493)|
| 2:55:01| District to RN2F HP District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10501)|
| 2:55:05| Benjamin C. Mullins, Applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| Yeah, I'd like to make kind of an unusual motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| I would like to make a motion to send this back to the Planning Commission for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| I viewed the agenda item in the March 11th meeting, and they had technical difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10523)|
| 2:55:30| and a couple of different commissioners were absent from the discussion, and one in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10530)|
| 2:55:35| wasn't able to get back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| One got on after the discussion and the motion was made, and another missed it entirely and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10536)|
| 2:55:43| was only able to get back on due to internet difficulties once the voting and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10543)|
| 2:55:49| had completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| So I'd like for it to go back and be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| And I think this needs full consideration due to the fact that this was a parcel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10554)|
| 2:56:01| was rezoned with existing fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| Council Member, why don't we see, before we get into the discussion, why don't first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| Mr. Swanson has appeared, so maybe there's an issue with the nature of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| Mr. Swanson, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| No, there's not actually a problem with the nature of the motion, but the motion should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| actually be a motion to refer the matter back to MPC because of technical issues arising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10582)|
| 2:56:29| during the hearing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| So that would be the appropriate motion, and then we'll see if we get a second and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| Do you want me to rephrase that, or we'll take Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| I'll make a motion to refer it back to the Planning Commission for consideration due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| to technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| Seconded by, who said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Roberto, Andrew Roberto, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| Council Member Ryder gave a little overview of why she made this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| Are there any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| I would just like to call on Mr. Mullins for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| I believe he's representing the property owner and is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10625)|
| 2:57:10| He wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| Mr. Mullins, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| Yes, thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| And I do appreciate your motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| This was another close vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| I think the vote was actually to approve rezoning to RN-2 when my request was to go to RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10643)|
| 2:57:34| and the vote was six in fix oppose and seven in favor, which had the effect of denying my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10654)|
| 2:57:44| application, although moving this board with a vote for the RN-2, which would make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| pre-existing uses on the property nonconforming, which is what we wanted to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10669)|
| 2:57:55| This is essentially a prior zoning equivalent request, although there's some quirks to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10675)|
| 2:58:03| because RN-4 wasn't considered prior zoning equivalent to RN-2, but RN-4 is more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| for the sector plan and the lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| So it's something I think, because of the technical issues, the vote might have went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| a different way had people not dropped off during the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10695)|
| 2:58:18| So I'd appreciate another chance to talk to Planning Commission about this before I come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10698)|
| 2:58:25| before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| Seeing none, does everyone understand the vote, the item you're voting on, the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10716)|
| 2:58:40| on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10720)|

| 2:59:03| And Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10743)|

| 2:59:20| FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| I mean, I don't think that matters too much, but just that you'd want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10767)|

| 2:59:59| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10799)|

| 3:00:20| You know, a lot of times people come on to the public forum, and they don't give kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| So what I would like to do is give kudos for your time and your efforts, for the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10825)|

| 3:00:31| A few things that I do want to list as far as kudos, as far as our city government is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| concerned, is give a hand clap to the Office of Neighborhood and for the conference that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| It was very, very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| And I just want to say thank you for that, because a lot of times we are not informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10845)|
| 3:00:49| sometimes by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| But I think that that conference was very informative, and it gave people a lot of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| So I wanted to say thank you very much to that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10856)|
| 3:01:00| I'm also very excited about the new app, My Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| I found out about that at the conference, and so I hope that a lot of my local Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10864)|
| 3:01:10| will use that app so that they can stay involved in the things that are going on with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Third, I also want to let Chief Thomas know that I'm very, very, very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10877)|
| 3:01:22| I know in the conference we talked about how KPD was going to take interest in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10882)|
| 3:01:30| I am an individual that has a diagnosis of bipolar and schizoaffectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10890)|
| 3:01:35| So it very much affects me how KPD shows up on the scene when we are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10895)|
| 3:01:43| And so just in the last two weeks, I had personal experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| And so I just want to say thank you for KPD taking that initiative to de-escalate situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10906)|
| 3:01:54| because of the training that they are getting and how to learn how to deal with people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| But what I really want to speak about today is speaking on solutions to improve the well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10920)|
| 3:02:05| of our youth in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| And I've heard tonight during this meeting different things that alluded to violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10927)|
| 3:02:13| and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10933)|
| 3:02:14| But what I always like to stay focused on are our youth who want to make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| our youth who are doing the good things, our youth who want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| And so one of the solutions that I want to bring up because Councilman Thomas said sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10944)|
| 3:02:31| we focus on the new programs, but I want to bring light to an old program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| Sometimes we forget about the resources that are right in our city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| 20 years ago, I was an intern under the leadership of Sam Anderson, and I was under the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10963)|
| 3:02:50| of Vic Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| And I learned how to swim 20-plus years ago and ended up becoming an aquatic specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10972)|
| 3:03:00| And so I want to encourage our city government to bring back our Learn to Swim programs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10980)|
| 3:03:09| continue on to junior lifeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| I currently have a 14-year-old and a soon-to-be 13-year-old who have been waiting patiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10991)|
| 3:03:17| to become a lifeguard, and they cannot become a lifeguard right now because our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10997)|
| 3:03:22| no longer allows junior lifeguarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| And I just want to speak on in these last 30 minutes about the importance of it, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11005)|
| 3:03:31| if these kids become involved as junior lifeguards at the age of 12, then they are already indoctrinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| to become city workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| What do I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11020)|
| 3:03:41| They will be junior lifeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| Then they'll be lifeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11023)|
| 3:03:44| Then they'll become aquatic specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11024)|
| 3:03:45| They'll go on and teach CPR and first aid in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11025)|
| 3:03:50| And so that's a life skill that they can use to become career-oriented in aquatics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11030)|
| 3:03:56| And also, when those children start early, they're acclimated in aquatics, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| They go on and they become on swim teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| Those swim team skills can also equate into scholarships that will go on to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| So what I'm saying to you all, please, please look at utilizing what we already have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11049)|
| 3:04:15| the city, which is our Parks and Recreation Department, so that our children can get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11055)|
| 3:04:20| work at the tender age of 12 if they are willing and able and ready to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11060)|
| 3:04:25| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11065)|

| 3:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11080)|
| 3:04:40| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11080)|

| 3:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11084)|
| 3:04:44| My name is Felicia Utsi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| I am the Artistic Director of Divine Urban Expressions, and I reside in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| at 1309 Thomas Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| Well, I am calling in today in support of funding for community-based programs dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| to violence intervention and prevention in collaboration with VIP partners in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| of their proposed budget for $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| And I want to share my story that in 2015, after me and seven other Divine Urban Expressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11108)|
| 3:05:14| Dream Team dancers were caught in a crossfire and walked to peace, I was led to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11114)|
| 3:05:20| with a city official with Save Our Sons that ironically was the very conversation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11120)|
| 3:05:26| led to the Legacy After Community Showcase, which was our dancers' collaborative solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11126)|
| 3:05:30| to the violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11130)|
| 3:05:31| It was at that exact time that I was told—that I told the official that we wanted to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11131)|
| 3:05:39| a press conference to allow the youth to let the community and all the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| know how they feel about the violence and what they felt was the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11143)|
| 3:05:48| She then went on to suggest that holding a press conference would bring back publicity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11148)|
| 3:05:54| and move—I mean, pivot the city in lieu of thinking that it would resonate with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| hearts of all involved, ensuring the safety of our youth for generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11158)|
| 3:06:04| So we were trying to hold a press conference and invited her to our very first community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| coming together celebration on December 22, 2015, where we presented the showcase led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11169)|
| 3:06:15| by the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11175)|
| 3:06:16| Unfortunately, she nor the mayor did not attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11176)|
| 3:06:21| Sadly, we lost four young kings to violence after our conversation with Save Our Sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| with only one being deemed a hero because he died while shooting his friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| Yet all the other young men's lives and deaths went under-recognized as they became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| another statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11195)|
| 3:06:36| In the same conversation, I asked about funding to provide excitement for 20 young kings I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11196)|
| 3:06:41| had been mentoring and cutting grass with for the elderly in an effort to keep their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11201)|
| 3:06:45| attention while sitting next to one of the young kings that I brought with me to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11205)|
| 3:06:50| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11210)|
| 3:06:51| He actually called me on the phone weeks prior to let me know that one of the boys who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11211)|
| 3:06:56| locked up with him connected me, connecting him to me to receive help with the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11216)|
| 3:07:02| he had a vision to implement for the youth when he was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| So when he got out, I picked him up and I brought him to the meeting with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11226)|
| 3:07:10| The official then proceeded to tell me that there was no funding to help with my program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| because according to the research conducted by Save Our Sons, young men only preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| working with men, in spite of me bringing a young man with me who needed support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11239)|
| 3:07:25| his effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| However, she said there was funding to compensate him as a facilitator, but when he told her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11247)|
| 3:07:33| of his kidnapping charge, there didn't seem to be much help for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11253)|
| 3:07:38| All he wanted was help with his violence prevention program while being able to afford his probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11258)|
| 3:07:43| fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| Unfortunately, he ended locked back up and the majority of the young men I was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| to help were also arrested in the exact same year for drug-related charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11268)|
| 3:07:54| And ironically, it was a portion of the Save Our Sons funding that was allocated to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11274)|
| 3:08:01| police department to lock up our son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| So I'm simply calling to let you know that six years later, another St. Anthony community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11284)|

| 3:08:20| by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11300)|
| 3:08:21| Yet we are still in need of space to call our own in collaboration with other Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11301)|
| 3:08:26| minority creators that serve the community through the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11306)|

| 3:08:44| I am hoping that the city opens its ears this time to hear the cries of those of us working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11324)|
| 3:08:49| together in the community to directly help those finally crying out for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=11329)|
