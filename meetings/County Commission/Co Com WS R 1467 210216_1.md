| 2:59:21| even have a job description for what to expect to do when you're a commissioner. What is expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10761)|
| 2:59:26| of commission? What is, we talked about decorum today. We talked about, you know, how to treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10766)|
| 2:59:31| your fellow commissioners, how to interact with the community. We don't even have any of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| stuff written down. It's like two words. So I just think that it's important to have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10776)|
| 2:59:41| discussions. I hope we can all work together to figure out a way to really make ourselves the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10781)|
| 2:59:47| most professional and the most organized and the most productive commission. We'll always disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10787)|
| 2:59:52| on different things, but hopefully we can kind of gel. I hope now this is a starting point. I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10792)|
| 2:59:57| our retreat might help that. And then hopefully, you know, as we go forward, we'll all make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10797)|
| 3:00:02| better commission and leave a little bit better footprint. So that being said, I will put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10802)|
| 3:00:08| tonight on the forum a basic question. Would you like to meet next month by Zoom or in person? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10808)|
| 3:00:17| if you are asking to do it on Zoom, would you participate in person? If we were all in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| and you would, you know, I'll phrase that in a way that leaves everybody an opportunity to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| feedback and we'll move forward. I do also want to say that, you know, I'm only the chair of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| commission. There is the chair of the rules and the rules chairman decided to have the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10832)|
| 3:00:39| in person. There's a different chairman for the finance committee. That chairman decided to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| it virtually. Everybody, there are different committees and they have different chairs. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| this is not to speak for every other subcommittee. That's not under my purview as chairman. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10847)|
| 3:00:54| the question will be for the work session and for the commission meeting, not for all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10854)|
| 3:00:58| other subcommittees. That is up to the, if I'm understanding it, that's really up to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10858)|
| 3:01:04| discretion as to whether to poll their old members or just unilaterally make a decision. I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| to get into that. But I do think this is the kind of thing that, you know, really sort of stays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| what is the precedence? Because I wasn't asked by the rules or the finance committee whether to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10873)|
| 3:01:19| do it this way or that way. It was just decided. Same thing, you know, other decisions are. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| this is just decision clarifying and I'll post that tonight. And I encourage you all to quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10884)|
| 3:01:30| reply to that and so we can set it forth. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10890)|
| 3:01:35| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to ask you, are you sure you want to post that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| given that the meeting is, we still have our regular meeting and it's a month away. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| that's a decision I think that can be made two, three weeks before our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10906)|
| 3:01:54| How about, well, I can do that too. It's up to you. What do you guys want me to do? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| I can wait and post it at the end of next week and then just kind of gauge everybody from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10918)|
| 3:02:04| We hope everything will, you know, the original goal of going virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| the purpose was for safety and health. And it was my intention to try to make sure we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10928)|
| 3:02:14| add to the rising counts and to really follow our best health advice. So I'm happy to wait and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| maybe at the end of next week, post it and then have everybody weigh in. If that's if I'm seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10940)|
| 3:02:26| yays or nays on that idea to wait until next Friday and post it. Okay, I'll do that. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| wait till next Friday, I'll post it and then we'll go forward. So thank you for the meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| discussion. I hope we continue that going forward. And that is the last item on our agenda. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10957)|
| 3:02:44| anybody have any other business before us tonight? Yeah, can I get an update on where we're at with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10964)|
| 3:02:50| the TVA towers and the move over there in the Andrew Johnson building? That was before my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10970)|
| 3:02:56| and I thought it would be done by now and it's not. Yeah, I think Chris Caldwell is still on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10976)|
| 3:03:03| the line. If not, I also will I will resend you a document on the sort of timeline of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10983)|
| 3:03:11| But Mr. Caldwell, are you with us still? He may or may not be. My is fine. Okay, I can give that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10991)|
| 3:03:23| chart. Mr. Bessler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to let you know it is finalized that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11003)|
| 3:03:31| that signs will be going up on Norris Freeway that it is now a scenic historic site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11011)|
| 3:03:39| They're taking care of so and that was done by some local people here and one of them was Michael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| Carberry who used to work on the MPC so he deserves a big high five when you see him. But Charlie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11024)|
| 3:03:53| making this county a lot better. Charlie, when you say historic side, is there a picture of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11033)|
| 3:03:58| up beside the highway? No, it's for the old people like the old six and a half year veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11038)|
| 3:04:04| up there. What is it? Smith was that in the whatever district that was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11044)|
| 3:04:10| Hey, thank you for that. Hey, listen, I didn't know Carson was that old and I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11050)|
| 3:04:15| Thank you for that information. Commissioner Ward, I will I will get an update from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11055)|
| 3:04:22| Caldwell on that. My understanding, though, is that everything is on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11062)|
| 3:04:27| You've seen a lot of cranes near TVA. They are doing all the upgrades that they said they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11067)|
| 3:04:33| You can also see from Gay Street, the elevator tower for part of the ADA accessibility that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| being built in that parking lot between the visitor center and and the building next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| And that is sort of a freestanding elevator stash stack and that everything is on track for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11083)|
| 3:04:50| for the school system to move over there in phases and throughout the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| Commissioner Smith may have more information, but my understanding is that everything continues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| just be on the original timeline, give or take. I just want what the timeline if they can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11100)|
| 3:05:05| email me a timeline of what it is being in construction. I kind of have an idea of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| it should be. So I just want to know the actual details. So you want to know when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11109)|
| 3:05:15| the school system will be fully over there? Correct. Okay. All right. Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11115)|
| 3:05:22| did you have some information on that? Yeah. The cranes are actually working on the TVA side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11122)|
| 3:05:29| not the not the Knox County side. UT and Knox County are both in the still in the demolishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11129)|
| 3:05:38| stage. The rebuild should start here in the next month or so, maybe two months. Originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11138)|
| 3:05:46| Commissioner Ward, the target was to have the school system into the TVA towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11146)|
| 3:05:52| by the start of this coming school year, and it appears we're still on track for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11152)|
| 3:06:00| Thank you for that additional information, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| Thank you very much for the new commissioners. They don't know it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| pretty sure it's going to be called the University of Tennessee Towers. They're going to be a UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| logo. So there's going to be UT logos on the outside, not a Knox County logo, but a UT logo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| which is beyond me. But that's what I've been told. So why is not Knox County logo out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11178)|
| 3:06:25| But there's a UT logo, there'll be a UT logo on the side of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11185)|
| 3:06:30| I think that was part of the lease agreement, but I'm sure they could reinforce that or get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| more clarification. So any other business to come before this body tonight? Seeing none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11195)|
| 3:06:41| I'll entertain a motion to adjourn. Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker, first by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11201)|
| 3:06:49| Smith. Thank you very much. We are adjourned. Have a great night, everyone. We'll see you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=11209)|
