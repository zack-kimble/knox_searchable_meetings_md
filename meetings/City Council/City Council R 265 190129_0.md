| 0:03:11| For the Mayor's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| first of all I want to thank everyone who is here with us tonight again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| for braving the snow and the cold to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| Potential ice, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| I want to particularly give a shout out to the City's Public Service Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| and their crews that were out on the streets for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| They spent Monday pre-treating city streets with brine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Then they followed up, reporting at 3 a.m. this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| to continue with snow preparations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| And then they switched over to the salt trucks once the snow started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| I think we're all very proud of their tireless work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Their commitment is never so apparent as during snowstorms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| because they really do work around the clock to keep the roads open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| So I want to recognize their great work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| as well as their director, our Director Chad Weff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| and Deputy Director Rachel Butzler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| So the City had 23 trucks used for plowing and salting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| and another seven used to apply brine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| And we have, I guess, about 75 employees trained and available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| to be dispatched whenever and wherever they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Also, besides the public service crews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| I want to thank our police officers, our firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| and of course our Knoxville area transit drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| It takes a whole lot of effort to keep everything going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| even when there's a slight snowfall, a small snowfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| Fortunately, it was less than originally anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| And so let's always remember these folks who keep us safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| and keep us moving during weather like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| I have a few important City meetings to announce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| There is a public hearing on the City's Community Development Annual Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| That's for the 2019-20 Annual Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| And that meeting is this Thursday, January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| That meeting starts at 5.30 p.m. at the John T. O'Connor Senior Center on Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| If there is bad weather, the alternate date will be the following Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| February 5th, so a week from tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| It is very important that we get community feedback on the Annual Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| This is the plan that guides how we spend our CDBG dollars, our home dollars, homelessness dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| And so at this meeting, you'll get an update on kind of how we are through the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| and what do people perceive as the highest priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Of course, affordable housing has been a very high priority for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| and we want to hear from people about that and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Then, Council members, my staff and I will meet on Friday morning, February 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| for the Annual Mid-Year Budget Retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| It will be at the Public Works Service Center on Morris Avenue, starting at 8 a.m. on February 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| That's typically what we do is we'll present updates on both the city's financial health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| and on multiple major city initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| The half-day retreat is open to the public, but for citizens who are unable to be there in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| CTV will be broadcasting the proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| and the city's finance and communications departments will post documents on our city website afterward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| And that website is www.knoxvilletn.gov slash budget, slash budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=393)|
| 0:06:42| Finally, I invite Council and all friends of the Knoxville Fire Department to mark your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| On Friday evening, February 8th, we welcome 32 newest firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| These recruits are graduating after 15 weeks in the fire academy, very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| I know Chief and all of the force is excited about having them complete their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Location still needs to be confirmed, so watch for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| And this is our first class of new recruits in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| and this will bring our KFD back to near full strength with 326 firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| and another 10 employees who are not firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| So we have a total department of 336 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| So we'll all celebrate, expect a big turnout of people to celebrate these 34 new recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| Okay, so that's the end of my report, Council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=462)|

| 0:16:03| in violation of their contract and that money will go back in and cover at least part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| the CEI cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Jim, this must have been pretty severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| This is an over 30% increase add on to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| According to the documents that we have, tell us about this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Who was the contractor and how did we get someone, according to the documents here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| that was not familiar with TDOT practices and working in utility districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| How did we land on this contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| The contractor had all of the certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| I guess part of the risk of the low bid contract process is that you get some people sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| who aren't as effective as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| In this particular case, I think we had some conflicting priorities on the part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1021)|
| 0:17:09| contractor who had some other work that he thought was more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| We did not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| And who was that contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Twin Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| So apparently it said in here that it was evident that the contractor's lack of participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| and presence in the project meeting and showed a lack of knowledge, let's see, what did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1045)|
| 0:17:36| Unfamiliarity with City of Knoxville and TDOT local programs, procedures, policy guidelines, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| Is there a way to put this contractor on notice that he's not allowed to bid for a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| We're going to get some of the money back, but we're not going to get the whole $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| back, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Plus, it's inefficient for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| We will have that discussion with our purchasing agent the next time we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| It's not necessarily easy to exclude somebody from the bid process, but there are valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| grounds to do so if, I don't see Royce around here today, so he can't elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1097)|
| 0:18:27| Mr. York wants to elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I can't give you the specifics on the Jim York, finance director, can't give you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| specifics on the exclusion, but we do have procedures in place that we can bar certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| vendors from bidding on projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Clearly, non-performance on past contracts would be one of those reasons, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| some other things as well, but we will be evaluating this particular problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| If he is indeed going, I mean, if they do bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Yeah, if they do want to bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Okay, so we have, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| The councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| I'm out of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1151)|

| 0:22:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Let me also just say, no one has signed up to speak on this, but Matt Welch from Rockbridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| is here, and of course Dr. Lyons is here to answer any questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| And so I'm not sure who wants to take this one, but for the sake of those in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| and those that are watching, I don't know if Deputy Chief Lyons, if you'd like to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| this and maybe kind of give a little background as to why this particular pilot would be somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| of an exception for this project and what that means and why we would be making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I'm glad to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| This one is a little different in that we have not taken many, or really any, pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| with functioning existing buildings that are clearly not in a state of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| They may be somewhat short of optimal performance, but we mostly dealt with redevelopment pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| that have taken a blighted structure or an empty lot or something like that and applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| In this case, the prior state is a functioning hotel, which Vista Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| We have a proposal, and Mr. Welsh is here representing Rockbridge Capital, to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| $61 million and re-flag the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| And though it is not starting at blight, it's a massive improvement and it's very much comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| to investment and in fact exceeds investment in other hotel projects we've supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| For instance, the Farragut Hotel was an $18 million investment, and this is a $61 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| So this is a little different in that it makes more use of the pilot as an economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| tool than it does as a blight removal tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| And as you know, taxing and financing requires that there be a declaration of blight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| a redevelopment area, so it's more explicitly about blight removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Payment in lieu of taxes is a broader base tool that we've used to attract businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| such as Riley Foods and to keep them here, and Knoxville Locomotive Works, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| using for improvements in properties and support of new construction on some properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| are more related to blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| So it takes more of the economic development approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| It takes an existing structure and offers a massive improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| And what it does have in common with our other ones is that this, we feel, is very much in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| the interest of the city economically and otherwise because it provides a great enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| for the convention center to have this rebranded, reflagged, greatly improved hotel over what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| there at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| And I also want to add to that that having the Marriott brand downtown I think will complement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| the other hotel options that we have as well and will definitely enhance our capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| for conventions for downtown as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| I want to ask Mr. Welch to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| What assurances do we have that this will be a Marriott brand, and what kind of assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| can we have since it's going to be two years out or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Again, Matt Welch from Rockbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| So we have done a lot of business with Marriott over the years, and we have an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| them, and we'd be happy to obligate in the IDB or the pilot lease that the obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| of a Marriott, a full-service Marriott premium flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| So the report shows that you're going to operate the first year as a holiday inn, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| the next year it says zero income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Do you intend to vacate the whole building at one time, or that was worst-case scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| So I think after acquisition, we're under a franchise agreement with the holiday inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| for approximately 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| And so at acquisition, we will start the process immediately upon endeavoring on a six- to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| 12-month design and development of a complex $35, $36, $37 million renovation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| And so through that process, we'll really hone in on that exact idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I mean, I think good news is we're all aligned to, one, go as fast as we physically can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| and two, keep the hotel open for as long as and as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| I think some of the things that we have going for us are there's two different entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| kind of one on the first floor as you come in off the street and park your car, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| one down on a park level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| So we think we can stage a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| We'll certainly try to keep the parking garage and as much of the event space open as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Obviously, we'll have to play a little bit of Jenga, if you will, as we move around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| So that's what we'll be studying significantly during the six to 12 months, and it will certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| be our goal to stay open as long as possible, also acknowledging that we have a very complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| and comprehensive renovation inside, outside, back of house infrastructure, elevators, escalators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| boilers, chillers, new windows, a completely new HVAC system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| So they have the kind of through-wall units today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| We'll be changing it out to a fully energy-efficient system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| So long and short, very complicated, plus a brand-new guest room to elevate to the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| that Marriott demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| This will be a full-service, upper-upscale, great hotel that we want everyone to be proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| of, including the city of Knoxville and us as owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Would you say that the life of that building as it is today, has it reached the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| its life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I mean, without extensive renovation, it's about done all it's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Is that what you all are saying with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| I think in a nutshell, I'm happy to elaborate, this 39-year-old building, much of the systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| are all original, and so in our estimation, just well past its useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| So are some of the systems we're working today, maybe with some duct tape, but it's time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| its renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| As much as the guest impact and front-facing renovation you'll see, you'll see as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| behind the walls and really in the stuff that you don't see, but really elevating it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| give it another 30, 40 years of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| So in our opinion, to answer your question directly, yes, it is much of the systems and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| the infrastructure is past its useful life, and that is a lot of the complexity and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| challenges of the renovation and what really drove up the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| So the Tennessean, you're going to keep it and maintain it and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| You all have experience working with Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| You all also have experience working with non-branded boutique hotels too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| We do, and so as part of the acquisition, we'll be acquiring both hotels, which we like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| and I think we can stage some things uniquely, but again, to answer your question, significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| experience operating both independent and branded flags across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| So yes, we're very confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| We like the Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| The current owner did a great job at the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| They've done a great job operating the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| The staff is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| We're really excited to kind of come in and put our mark on it and take it to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| So don't anticipate today much renovation in the Tennessean, but we'll obviously always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| endeavor to keep improving our assets and be a great member of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| It doesn't have a pilot on it, does it, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| No it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Okay, so you don't have to assume anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| The Tennessean does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| The Tennessean does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| The Holiday Inn does not, but the Tennessean does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| The Tennessean does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| So he assumes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Yes, he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| So not adding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| This pilot doesn't add anything to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| This is just for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Separate transactions with the same owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| That'll happen more or less simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| But separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| They don't stack on top of each other anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Well, I think it does really add to the convention center, and I think I want to ask Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| about how, Jim, can you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| We owe quite a bit of debt left on the convention center, and it's important to us that we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1845)|
| 0:30:54| to support it and support it all that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| I mean, how much debt do we owe left on it, and approximately, and how many more years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Again, Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I believe it's $105 million left on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| If it runs to full maturity, it will pay out on June 5th, 2032.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| My expectation is that it will currently satisfy that debt sometime in 2028, 2029, maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| We're running ahead of where we should, and we'll be probably paying that off again three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| to four years early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Well, I think it's important to support that, and for that reason, I think we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| support the convention center all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| 2032 would be the longest, but anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I will when I have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I appreciate the questions of my fellow councilmembers, and I don't want to be redundant, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| think this is a little bit of an exceptional case, and so I just want to kind of revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| some of what I've heard, not only out here, but also from Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| If you could just speak to a little bit more explicitly about why this is exceptional and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| unique, and how we will ... I guess I have a little bit of a concern that we are potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| opening the door for other existing operating businesses who are interested in upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| you know, asking for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| And I understand that there's a difference, but I just want maybe a little bit more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| an explicit description of what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| I do think that it is a very key distinction to make, and I'm glad you raised the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| of upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| As you heard from Mr. Welch, it is really a complete redo with a very substantial investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| rather than an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Most of the upgrades or improvements or investments are not going to affect the appraisal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| the assessment, or they do so in a very marginal way, which would be never worth pursuing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| pilot and probably would never withstand a third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| This is a unique case because of, A, the size of the investment, and B, the asset that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| working on is such direct interest to the city, and the fruits of the investment will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| pay off in so many ways other than just an eventual property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| For instance, the hotel-motel tax on higher rooms and more occupancy, they figure now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| it's in the mid-60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| The assumption is it will go into the mid-70s with this improvement that's many, many millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| of dollars in time over sales tax and hotel-motel tax that will be collected by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Also, we think it's going to help in the attraction of more conventions, which not only help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| this hotel but other hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Its benefit to the city goes far beyond just the actual economics of that structure because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| of the unique location of it next to and serving the convention center and actually being connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| to the city invested in the physical connection from the Tennessean over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| I think the main distinction is the fact of the massive investment and basically redo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| to a totally different hotel with totally different infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| As Mr. Welch said, this is, though not blighted, it's in such condition that it needs a massive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| infusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| In this case, it will be literally a totally different appearance with totally new infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| Also, again, its location is critical to the city's future and to the economic health of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Dr. Lyons, when we're talking about here with this pilot, they would have their current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2091)|
| 0:35:00| rate of property tax frozen over the term of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| And I definitely understand your point about this is a little different than what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| seen before in the pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| This is really being used as an economic tool and, you know, I think the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| to the convention center and exactly what you talked about with, you know, increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| revenue you could see from sales tax and hotel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| I can see all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| So this is primarily different from maybe some of our other discussions because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| is really an economic discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| So what we're talking about here is we'll keep the present $165,000 a year tax payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| and we see that as a plus that it's already at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Most of them that come before you go from very low to with literally blighted structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| producing hardly any property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| This will continue to produce what the 165 plus it will add on the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| And of course, Mr. York mentioned the amount of convention center that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| All of the sales tax revenue spent in the CBID, the state portion goes directly to retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| that convention center debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| So that's one of the reasons we're ahead right now is we're doing so well in helping retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| that debt and any dollar that goes there would otherwise have to come out of the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| fund to repay that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| So those sales tax dollars at that location or any location of the CBID are even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| important than they would otherwise be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| You got Director York off the hook for my next question by answering it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| I sure he appreciates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| And I think that's an important point is that increased sales tax revenue that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| inside the tourism development zone, that accesses sales tax monies that we would otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| have to use, like you said, general fund monies to fund the payoff or the pay down of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| Everything going on downtown and all the investments as council and your predecessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| have approved have led to a 50 percent increase in sales tax revenue over the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| in the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, that's phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| And of course, the way the convention center debt retirement works is we have to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| the collections in Knox County as a whole and we've been exceeding them by a good bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| I think this one is, like I said, a little bit unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| It's a little more difficult of a decision to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| And I know Councilman Wallace already mentioned this, but Mr. Welch, definitely this needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| to be what it says in our packet, which you already committed to today, a full service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Marriott brand hotel because what I think when we're having an economic driven discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| that's really what is the driver in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Matt Welch from Rockbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| Completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| And, you know, that's what attracts us candidly as we see the opportunity, but it takes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| significant capital investment, which we're ready and willing to do and willing to obligate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| ourselves to form that type of renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| And the good news for, I think, the city is they have the brand standards of the franchise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| at Marriott holding our feet to the fire as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| And they don't bend the rules and we're good partners with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And so we have obligations from multiple angles and our own investment hurdles that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| we want to spend the right amount of money because we think that's the key that unlocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| the potential of the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| And so we, candidly, I think we're truly aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Mr. Welch, I have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| Has the firm discussed that if this public assistance does not come through that you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| still be doing the Marriott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Have you guys discussed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| So, again, Matt Welch from Rockbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| So currently we are under purchase agreement with the hotel with a rapidly extinguishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| And this is a condition to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| And so we haven't really gotten there, but it is a condition to close at this point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| And the economics are such that, you know, but for the pilot, the economics are challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| The rate of return right now without public assistance would be like 10 percent, a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| With it, it would bring it up to 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| So I don't really see this in the but for category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| I'm also curious about if this is something that we do right now, Marriott, what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| want, why we would do this would be to help raise our image of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| That also means what kind of corporate citizen are you going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Is the Marriott going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Right now there are over 20 Marriott's all over the country that are in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| labor disputes with their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| That's not something we want here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| We want our employees treated well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| So I'll tackle the first one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| So as we first made application, we applied for a 15-year pilot, which is what you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| And through going through the process with Municap and working with Bill and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| you know, we, as we got the report back and as we discussed, we really, you know, discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| the merits of the transaction and agreed to reduce the ask to a 10-year pilot, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| think is what is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| And I think the returns you're seeing are inflated because of the reduced ask that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| So you see a 15-year tax abatement ask, pilot, excuse me, pilot ask, which what we're, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| think, believe seeking approval for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| So those are not the right numbers, the rate of return with the 10-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| So we had gotten the report based on a 15-year after receiving the report and conferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| with Bill and his team agreed to reduce the ask to a 10-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| And so that would reduce the returns and the time period, so we'd basically get a handful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| of less years from the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Yeah, we worked with him, excuse me, we worked with Matt and suggested with 10, pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| negotiated it to 10 with a three-year construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| I might also add that, you know, all of these returns, none of them are guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| What is not entered to this is a lot of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| They don't get the room rate that they propose and all kinds of things can affect that, downturns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| in the economy, many other things, then that return would be far less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| So with the amount, we think that the, what we ask when we do the third-party review is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| what would be a reasonable industry standard review expected and what would it take to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| get them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| And we would find that investors generally would not put that much money with that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| risk if they were, you know, if the return were any lower, and that's pretty much what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| that's based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| I mean, I realize this is how the game is played, that you bring people in to do economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| development and then ask the people, the citizens to help pad that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| And I know that's what we need to do because Marriott will help the image of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| But I am tired of this type of procedure where it's like if we don't play ball, you'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| take your ball and go to another city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| And that makes me really angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| So I'll be voting against it and those are my reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| You know, I think this is a very good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| You know, I'm certainly in favor of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| It seems like a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| I think it would be an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| But I don't feel comfortable supporting the pilot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| You know, I've, you know, supported a lot of pilots and TIFs and think they're an extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| important tool in, you know, developing downtown and addressing problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| And I just don't see that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And I'm afraid if we go down this path, we set a bad precedent when, you know, a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| you know, is going to make an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| It's going to be, you know, perceived better, you know, may have more revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| But it's essentially, you know, an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| We're going from a 286-room Holiday Inn, full service, to a 290-room Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| So there's not a big change there, you know, to me that warrants this type of public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2601)|
| 0:43:31| So, you know, it's been mentioned about the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| Well, just because it's a large investment, you know, then, you know, smaller hotels or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| smaller businesses, they're not going to feel that's fair, you know, that you have to, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| know, be a huge player to get assistance from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| And then the other thing is just a lot of times we're looking at these pilots and tips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| on challenging properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| And the but-for test, something that's always wrestled for me is, well, what if this, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| know, doesn't happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| You know, could this property remain vacant and blighted for years to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| In this case, it's an operating function hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| So, you know, if it doesn't work out and they're not able to do the upgrades, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| we still have an asset, we still have a 186-room hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| We've actually got sort of a different product on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| We've got a number of hotels in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So, you know, I think it's a great project, but I'm not comfortable supporting the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I also am not comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I kept looking at it, comparing it to the pilots that we've issued in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| I do have a specific question for Mr. Welch in a second about employees and during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| But I just wanted to say, yeah, we've used pilots as a tool for things that aren't on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| the shelf or things that are shelved and not in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| This is in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| It seems to be functioning well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I had no idea that I had bad standards when I stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| I mean, I guess that sounds insulting, but there's all this stuff about it would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| if it was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| I didn't know that when I stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Had lunch there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Took my kids there for snow day lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| It was delicious, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I have spoken to employees that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I know someone who works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| They have benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| You have employees there or there are a benchmark has employees with benefits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| I know there's some, they're on the fence right now about the closing and the closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| date moving and their benefits moving and transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| Some specific questions, because I'm not, I might be in the minority here with my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| against the pilot, but when folks transition to your benefits plan, because they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2750)|
| 0:45:59| to become your employees, they're transitioning over, will they maintain their benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Will there be a waiting period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| What kind of human or what kind of human resources impact will that have on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| That's question number one about their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Number two, you're going to be closed for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| That says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Plain as day in the packet, and it says that you'll have zero income, zero room rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| zero food, et cetera, during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| I understand it's a massive renovation that you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| What happens to those employees then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| You guys are Rockbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| You're based in Columbus, so what are the options for those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| I realize there's a lot of jobs out there and there's a lot of people looking for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| but you have employees with benefits, and when they go somewhere else, even if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| with benefits, they're going to have a waiting time with their benefits to kick in, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| a massive concern for me with the national climate we have with health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Again, Matt Welch from Rockbridge, so I'll answer the first one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| One point of clarification, Rockbridge will not be the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| We will have an operating company, Ambridge Hospitality, similar to the setup today with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Benchmark and the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| One thing I think we'll take comfort in is Ambridge is the largest operator in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| They have approximately 850 hotels throughout their portfolio and a first-class organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| and endeavors to treat employees right as is the standards of owner and aligned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| operator there, so there'll be no gap in benefits and certainly are taking all the steps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| ensure a smooth transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Obviously, a lot of employees there, which we value, and I think, as I mentioned, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| great people and the current owners put together a great team and I hope all of them stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| and most, if not all, will be offered employment under the current conditions, and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| there'll be some minor tweaks in benefits, but we'll be treated fairly and there'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| no gap in the benefits there, and again, take comfort in that Ambridge is a world-class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| operator and does these transitions, not to be cavalier, but all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| Do you work with that same group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| You said you had 60 hotels in your portfolio, is that the same group you work with at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| It is not, and we have a plethora of managers that we work with throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| and actually this is our first transaction with Ambridge, but have known each other for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| a long time and kind of colleagues in the business and just finally found the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| project to work on, so I think that's hopefully that answered the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| For the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| For the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| We're not open for a year, two, three years, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| I don't think you're aiming for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Certainly not, and I think you'll take a little comfort in that we do this a lot, the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| is one that we've executed on before, and we'd like to think we're pretty good at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| but as you acknowledge it, as we certainly acknowledge it, it is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| Our goal, my goal, is to stay open as long as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| We plan the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| There are certainly ways to phase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I got touched on a little bit earlier how there's different entrances, and I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| can get creative, and we'll certainly keep as many of the outlets open as possible, restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| and meeting space, and the parking garage, so that plan needs further study, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| and that's first thing, first order of business is to get that renovation plan in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| I think a couple of things to kind of ease the transition there if we are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| As being the owner of the Tennessean, it does give us an advantage to have a bit of a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| structure there that we can, we'll stay open there, we'll have operations there, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| not as though we just disappear and the operations team vanishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| There's already some kind of shared services and complexing there, so we endeavor to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| employees there, and again, we have a hotel we're very proud of there that continues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| ramp up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| The Ambridge, as I said, has 850 hotels, and one thing they pride themselves on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| opportunities to move throughout the country and place folks within their hotels, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| was one of the big, one of the keys for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| The hotel business is a people business, and we really value that, and we know how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| the people drive the value of a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| We can build the most beautiful projects in the world, but if you have a bad front desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| experience, a bad valet experience, it doesn't matter, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| You don't care if the EC works in your hotel, if someone's rude to you, but you, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| you're willing to overlook a lot if someone's really nice to you and can make your stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| or break your stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| In the world we live in, TripAdvisor and all the feedback loop is almost constant, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| that's a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a high standard and really welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| that feedback, so I think we're generally aligned there, and so I think we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| to go as fast as we can with doing the right renovation, and I think what will come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| on the other side, as well, should be an enhanced opportunity as we will bring things like valet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| to the Holiday Inn, which didn't necessarily exist before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| We will be expanding, reconcepting the food and beverage, again, just more, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| things that we have plans and vision for, we need to get in and design and develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| our anticipation is that we pride ourselves on guest satisfaction and you need people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| to satisfy your guests in the people business, so our hope is that we expand the offering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| expand the number of employees so that when we cut on on the other end, we retain as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| of the great people as we can and we add to the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| So the answer to the question is, for the employees that would need a job during your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| closure, it's Ambridge, they have other things in this area, or it would be about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| to where those opportunities are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| They're everywhere, and candidly, we own hotels as well in Tennessee, we have a hotel in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3106)|
| 0:51:54| So there are things in our metro area, and the Tennessean would be also an option for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| your stellar employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Facilitating the smooth, and obviously everyone has free will for where they'd like to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| and helping through that process is a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| I think you know this, you've done this before, you have employees with concerns during transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| it's very hard, the instability for folks, so that's my specific questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| I'd also like to direct a question to you Mr. Welch, as it relates to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| because I do know several people that are current employees there as well, and the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| owner there has actually assembled a really excellent team of people there at the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| in all levels of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| And there are some people there that have been there nine to ten years, and so thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| of those people and the hardship potentially that it would create on them to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| get transportation to Gatlinburg to work every day, those types of things, and so would a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| person who is currently employed there, knowing that you'll be closed for a year, I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| Tennessean is already staffed, so you're not going to have a lot of capacity there to absorb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| a lot of those employees that don't have the ability for transportation to go outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| the city or the county of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Would those employees have some top consideration on being rehired, and are there some thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| around some additional benefits that could be considered for those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| Again, Matt Welch from Rockbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Without question, and one thing you will notice, at least I think worth mentioning, is while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| we don't have revenue, we are carrying expense during that time, and there's dollars allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| in the budget and dollars allocated in the pro forma, and to shut down a hotel and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| come out clean and then just go hire everybody, that just doesn't work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| You need a team that's selling your hotel and prepping the hotel, and as rooms are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| online, it's a live kind of moving animal, and so I think that it'll be a little smoother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3246)|
| 0:54:15| than anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| We can try to certainly do our best to certainly ease all questions at the staff level during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| transition, and members from both the Ambridge team and the Rockbridge team will be on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| during the transition to, again, address a lot of these, and I think obviously the unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| brings unknown fear, and so I think we can dissuade a lot of that, and so to answer your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| question, yes, and then we would endeavor to help in any way possible to, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| preferential treatment, facilitating within the city of Knoxville for other hires, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| it came to that, but our goal would be to keep the staff, and so that when we come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| the renovation, we hit the ground running and get going moving fast to generate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| revenue, which keeps the train moving, so again, I feel that we're aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| Obviously it's a big renovation we're talking about, so there's some complexity in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| that we'll just have to navigate, but I'm certainly open to other thoughts if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| And so, you know, initially I did share a lot of the same concerns that my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| have voiced as it relates to this unconventional pilot that we are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3322)|
| 0:55:32| The reason that I am leaning toward being in support of it is because of the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| and that it is connected to the World's Fair Exhibition Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| Being a connector, I think, actually puts it in a different category because it truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| is connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| When you walk into that hotel, you can take an escalator down to the exhibition hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| and so to me that gives it a different type of enhancement and a different level of, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| think, importance to us as a city, and to be able to bring in that tourism and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| different conventions, and so that's where I sit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| Again, I will be watching very closely, if this does go through, how the employee transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| what that looks like, and would definitely look to have some conversation with that management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| team in advance of the closure, probably at least six months in advance of that to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Could I ask Mr. Lyons to refresh my memory about the Supreme Court site, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| Hotel also coming there as well, and what the capacity is of that and its connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| to the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| We were talking about space, overflow space there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| I forgot exactly how many rooms are going to be in the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| There will be a hotel that is at the Supreme Court site as part of that development, along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| with the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Obviously, it will be at a different price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| It will be more of a boutique hotel, but it will provide, again, a broader portfolio of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| rooms for guests at the Convention Center and for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| I don't see it as directly competing with this Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| I think there would be probably a slightly different audience for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| They're even thinking of some longer-term Airbnb-type possibilities for that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| so that will help with the Convention Center, but not in the direct way that the full-service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| Marriott would in attracting conventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| We have also heard of a hotel that's coming to the site between the Mast Building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| Century Building on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Is there also a hotel coming there as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| That's on hold right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| We've been approached by a developer for a hotel there, but while things are in flux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| and for some of the reasons that one can infer from what you just raised in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| of the total supply of rooms and the expense of rooms, they're waiting for that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| to settle out before pursuing that any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| We're bringing on the Embassy as well on Gay Street, across from the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| Not we personally, the city, but it's coming online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| It's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| We've got the Embassy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| In fact, the dual-brand Marriott will be opening too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| We had a recent opening of the Farragut, and we're really very happy that there's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| much interest for people to come in and invest and have confidence in the downtown's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| In fact, we're continuing to get good occupancy rates and holding the rates steady, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| feeling quite good about how that's all doing, and that's going to also provide a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| capacity for larger conventions in terms of total rooms available, so that'll put us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| in play for conventions that right now turn right away because we don't have nearly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| rooms to compete with other comparable cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| So do we know what conventions we've turned away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| What we're hearing is that the Holiday Inn's running at an occupancy of 60-some percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| and many of the other hotels I watched, when you guys discussed the pilot for the Garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| Inn on Cumberland, they were talking about rates in the 50-percent range, so I've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| to hoteliers today that said there was only one night during the football season last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| year that they sold out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| I'm just a little concerned about the number of hotels and the tips and the pilots attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Many of them were in unused facilities and sites, and now we're talking about freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| taxes for one business so that we can maintain status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| Well, we are not at risk for any city investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| If some of these don't come through, and of course the embassy's actually getting built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3594)|

| 1:03:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Well, I notice that one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| So, Mr. David Nix, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| And please keep an eye, where is our timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| Our timer up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Awesome, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| You can see it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| I'm David Nix, 2413 East Fifth Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| and I'm here to discuss the Magnolia Corridor marker that is proposed to be placed at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| entrance of the Magnolia Project just across the First Creek. Some of you might not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3841)|
| 1:04:11| but the City of Knoxville, I mean the Park City, was established in 1907 and it was incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3851)|
| 1:04:22| into the City of Knoxville in 1917. And Park City at that time went from First Creek to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| Chestnut Ridge, which follows the interstate. On the south side it was Pine Hill, the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| of Pine Hill, which is Mayberry's Hill, all the way to Chihuly Park. All of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| was Park City at one time, which had its own mayor, its own council people. So it has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| very interesting history. During its short term of 10 years when it was an official city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| it had several expositions. It had an Appalachian Exposition of 1910 and one in 1911. It had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| a National Conservation Exposition in 1913, which was attended by Presidents Roosevelt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| and Taft. It is the birthplace of Mountain Dew, not the hooch, but the actual Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Dew soft drink. It had the first electric streetcar. It had the first integrated school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3915)|
| 1:05:23| in Knoxville. And that's just a short thing. I mean people saw the first airplane land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| in Knoxville there. So it has a very interesting history. The Magnolia Avenue, a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3930)|
| 1:05:39| think that Magnolia Avenue is named for because it had magnolia trees on it. That's not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| reason Magnolia was named Magnolia. That had nothing to do with it. The magnolia trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| came later on because, oh, we have Magnolia Avenue, so let's plant magnolias on it. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| was actually named for Magnolia Brenner, who was the wife of George Brenner, who was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3955)|
| 1:06:04| wealthy plantation owner from Georgia. So that's who Magnolia Avenue is named after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| is Magnolia Brenner. So Magnolia is really not an appropriate name for such a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| area. I don't think it would do justice to the neighborhood of Park City, let alone the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| city of Knoxville. Shereen Jacobs of Chihuahua Hills, which is Cherry Street to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| she started a petition to actually get the name or try to propose a name change instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| of Magnolia of Historic Park City. So far there's 156 people that have signed the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| of wanting that change. So I think it would be a great thing to actually change and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| put Magnolia on this because Magnolia means, pretty much it means nothing. It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| almost the same thing if the city decided to do a Broadway corridor redevelopment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| you get out to Fountain City and you put a big monument there that says Broadway. People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| in Fountain City would be pissed if you put a big sign that said, you know. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| this would be a great thing to reflect the history of that area to name it Historic Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4036)|
| 1:07:24| City. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Okay, Council, that is the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| of our agenda. So if there's no further business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190129?start=4051)|
