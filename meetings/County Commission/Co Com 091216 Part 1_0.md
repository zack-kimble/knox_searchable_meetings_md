| 0:01:55| Our devotional this month will be led by Commissioner Bud Armstrong, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| by Commissioner Greg Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| I gave a lot of thought to what we needed to talk about tonight in terms of a devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| I could invite a preacher and I could say a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| I've got a few words that actually came from my mother as a message to me that I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| to share with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| So the words come from 2 Chronicles 7.14, and it has to do with people and what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=144)|
| 0:02:33| are called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| And in that particular scripture, God says that if my people who are called by my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn away from their wicked ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=162)|
| 0:02:51| then will I hear them from heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| And the key word there in our devotion is called by my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| It reminds me of an instance that happened a long time ago and in a place far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| There was a tent sitting in the middle of a field where a general was within, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| had just finished today's battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| And the general was preparing for the next day's battle when one of his officers walks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| into the tent and he throws this lad at his feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| The general didn't even acknowledge what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| He kept working on his plans and thinking about tomorrow's encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| But he did speak when the officer said, what brings you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| And the officer said to the general, this young man ran in the face of battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| The general kept looking at his papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Not looking at the young man at all, he said, what is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| And the young man, still laying upon the ground, sat up and said, my name is Alexander, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| And the general gripped the edge of his table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| His knuckles turned white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| He stood up and he reached down and he grasped the boy and he pulled him erect and he looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| in his eyes and he said, what is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| The young lad looked back down at his feet a little ashamed and he said, Alexander, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| And the general, the great Alexander the Great, looked at the boy and he said, young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| either change your ways or change your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| And we at this body are privileged to be called oftentimes honorable, oftentimes commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=284)|
| 0:04:53| oftentimes county commission of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| And we have the privilege of representing the people all across this county in the duty of their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| And I think we need to stop at times and remember that we are called by a name and we represent that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=304)|
| 0:05:16| And in our devotion tonight, let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for an opportunity to come together as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| to come together for the people of Knox County, come together to do the duty of the people who have elected us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| Help us to be able to humble ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| Help us to be able to pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Help us to seek your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Help us to turn away from the ways that are not pleasing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| We ask you then, if you will hear our voice, that you will look down upon us, that you will forgive us when we err,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:55| and that you will help our county and our land and our people, that we can move forward effectively as we govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| In thy precious son's name, Jesus Christ, we say this, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:11| All stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=371)|

| 0:06:17| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=385)|

| 0:06:46| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| I'd like, Mr. Chairman, if you would, to remove 105 from consent so we can have it read out to the persons here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=409)|
| 0:07:00| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Yes, I'd like to have 103 and 104 postponed to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=422)|

| 0:07:28| Yes, I would like to have the mayor to come down and talk about the Coastville trip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| and I'd like to move that to the front of the agenda because he has some prior appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=452)|

| 0:08:01| and I'd like to have that deferred for 30 days and have all items that say to be added to be added and deferred, deferred, and withdrawn, withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=481)|

| 0:14:03| Grant Standifer, Compassion Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| I think the mayor is going to introduce him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| It's my pleasure to introduce Grant Standifer to the group today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| I think most of you may already know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| He heads the Compassion Coalition, and it is an outstanding group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| I had my first real experience with them back during Hurricane Katrina relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| and when we had literally thousands of people coming to our community who needed help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I don't know that there was a group that stepped up any more than Compassion Coalition did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| They were there every day at our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| They contributed significantly to help people during the transition period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| and we would have been in a world of hurt without Grant and his organization helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Today, he's presented each of you with a copy of a book, Salt and Light Guidebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and it is a really comprehensive resource to those who want to reach out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| volunteer, and serve those in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| and it can really highlight what happens when churches, citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| governments work together and volunteer to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| So, Grant, thank you for the work you do each and every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| and thank you for visiting with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Grant Standifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| The Compassion Coalition is a coalition of churches and pastors and believers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| all over our county who are committed to moving beyond the walls of our church buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| to be the loving, serving, compassionate presence of Christ in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| There are almost 700 churches in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| There are about 113,000 folks who profess an affiliation with a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| So, if we can begin to mobilize those folks and we can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| and lock arms with one another and join hands with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| we can have an incredible impact in our county and in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| One of the tools that we use is the Salt and Light Guidebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| and as public servants who care deeply about the citizens of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| we wanted you to have a copy of this, a complimentary copy of the Salt and Light Guidebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| Just very briefly, it is sort of a massive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| This is the third edition that we've published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| It has 440 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Very briefly, I know you have a full schedule, a full agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| but I just want to give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| There are five sections to the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| In the first section, there are 28 chapters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| For every one of those 28 chapters, we put together a focus group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| here from citizens of Knox County that deal with that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| It might be homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| It might be those who are in the foster care adoption system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| It might be those suffering with HIV AIDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| It might be victims of domestic violence and abuse or single moms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| In every one of those chapters, what you have is an essay at the beginning of that chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| about the realities of what it means to live in Knox County as a single mom or as a homeless person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| Then in each one of those chapters, we have a glimpse in the life of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| We've gone out and interviewed someone in Knox County who found themselves in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| situation, and we've told their story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Then we have a story of hope that really tells how when an organization, an agency, a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| an individual comes alongside someone and walks with them and serves them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and now they're in a different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Maybe a single mom that's in a very different place from where she used to be or a homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| person who now has housing and has a job and is living on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| We tell that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| But I think the most important aspect for you as commissioners is at the end of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| one of those chapters is every possible resource that we have been able to uncover in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| that deals in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| We have contact names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| We have website addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, descriptions of what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| particular agency or non-profit does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| So when people come to you as a commissioner and they need help in a particular area, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| trust and believe that this will be an amazing resource for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| One of the other sections, one of the other five sections, is a section on collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Compassion Coalition really believes that we should avoid duplication of services as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| So instead of recreating the wheel or starting something else, we believe that people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| have a heart for service should come alongside existing organizations and agencies in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| So we have a whole section in there on the importance of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| So we hope and trust and believe that this will be a useful tool for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| We had 10,000 copies of these published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| We've had them about two months, and we have distributed about 2,000 copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| They don't do the county or the citizens of our county any good if they're sitting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:07| So if you know of others who would benefit from this resource, just have them go to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| website at CompassionCoalition.org, and they can order one off our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| Just wanted to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| That would be a great resource because we do get hit up a lot, and this would be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| resource for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Thank you for your heart of compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Mr. Mayor was down at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| He can come on back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| Your public forum time, you've got five minutes, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Well, remind me when I've got a minute left, and I'll be sure to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Well, first, let me begin by saying I appreciate the interest in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| I've made no secret of the fact one of my four priority items during the term of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| administration is to create new and better jobs for our citizens, and that just doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| happen because you wish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| It happens because you work at it, and I think we've done a pretty good job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Prior to the recession hitting us, you can recall that we had created 30,000 new regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| jobs, and we worked closer together as a region than we ever have through our efforts with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Jobs Now and going forward to Innovation Valley because we live in a worldwide economy, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| it's important that we work together as a region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Because of our efforts over the past several years, more years than not, we've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| state's best employment rate as a county, which also means we have the state's lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| unemployment rate as a county, and again, I applaud those who work in economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| offices every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| During my first term in office, I made 400 business visits to firms of all sizes, both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| large and small, and during my second term in office, I've made over 200 business visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| again, to both small and large companies because both represent the backbone of our economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| infrastructure and the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| During those visits, the purpose has been pretty simple, to encourage them, to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| them, and to find out what we can do to assist them to grow and prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| We've recruited new businesses, Green Mountain Coffee, Tennessee Steel, Exedy Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| National Partitions, that list goes on and on and on, and the reason we've been so successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| in that area is because we've worked at it collectively together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Just last week, we had a nice announcement, one that Commissioner Smith brought to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| several years ago, Moore Trucking Company, and at our Development Corporation meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| we sold them some additional property in the East Bridge Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| I appreciate Chairman Strickland being in attendance, Commissioner Norman, you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| there that day, 200 new jobs for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Again, a great example of how you can work together to grow your economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| I mentioned that we are in an international economy, and we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Recently, the Governor visited China, Mayor Haslam visited Japan, Mayor Cunningham in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Blount County visited the United Kingdom, and as President of the County Executives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| of America, I went to Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| And let me tell you a little bit about Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| It is the world's newest democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| For years, it was a part of the Soviet bloc, part of Yugoslavia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| A dictator named Soledad Milosevic went into Kosovo and wreaked havoc executing hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| and hundreds of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| The United States came in, along with European allies, and provided relief, and now they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| living there in peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| So it's gone from a socialist, communist-type country to a democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Prior to my trip, I was briefed on what I should do by the White House, and also multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| briefings by the United States State Department, which I appreciate greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| In Kosovo, there are no golf courses, there are no luxury hotels, the places I stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| didn't have air conditioning, and it was the middle of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| But I can tell you this, they have wonderful people who really appreciate Americans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| what we've done for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I couldn't have been treated nicer or more warmly during my visits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| So you'll know I plan on going back to Kosovo and work with them in any way I can to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| move them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| In terms of opportunities for American companies there, there are many, but there are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| many challenges to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Will we be moving American jobs to Kosovo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Absolutely not, nor have we in the past, nor will we in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| But there are opportunities there for American companies to invest and engage in that economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| and I hope we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| I think democracy succeeding in Kosovo is critically, critically important, and we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Again, when I was there, I visited with a large group of mayors, the United States Embassy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American University, the United States Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| for International Development, and it was a wonderful experience, which I will always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| But again, no luxury trip, no resort, and I would encourage some of you, if you ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| have the opportunity to take a trip like this, to take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| And I hope I have a couple of minutes left because I want to change gears for just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| second and clear up a few things that have been out there that some people have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| that are just totally incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| First, as it relates to our budget, some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| We have the second largest fund balance in Knox County's over 200-year history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| We have the best bond rating in Knox County's history, and we've been able to go 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| or longer without a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Some people say, well, you've ran up some debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Well, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| But let's look at what we've ran up the debt for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Hardin Valley High School, Gibbs Elementary School, Powell Middle School, the Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| Schools, $15 million in capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| We've increased spending on education annually by $90 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| We've opened Amherst and Bricky McLeod Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| We've also contributed $6 million to the VA Home, $1 million to the Veterans Memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| I don't know about you, but I think those are worthwhile expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| A network of senior centers in the community in South Knoxville, Quariton, Carter, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| We expanded the Strang Center and the O'Connor Center downtown, all of which I think are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:25| Additionally, we funded expansions and renovations at the Beck Cultural Center, which we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| another one going on now that will be opening in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| And also the Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| We've opened libraries in Burlington, Fountain City, Powell, and some other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| So I think that's good use of taxpayer dollars and things that we can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| So the budget is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Our economy is struggling, but we're going to continue to work as hard as we can with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| our economic development agencies, our existing businesses, so that East Tennessee can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| the leader when we come out of this recession and we can grow and prosper for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| So this may be the last time I see some of you before Christmas, so I hope each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| have a very Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a great 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| Thanks for allowing me to address the trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Brad, you've got your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:20| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Jolie, could you patch me into the big screen, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| If the folks at CTV would like to get a shot of the big screen as well, the folks at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| can see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Let's see if this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| As I've told you several times, somebody changed your annual reports, both your state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| and your federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| This is on file in the local TDAC office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| Now, I know the annual reports were on file before I filed my lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| But miraculously, after I filed it, they all vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| No one has turned over the original state or federal EPA report for 03, 04, or 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:07| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I can prove that the EPA 503 certification statements were worded improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| And I have recovered a portion of the original reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| I'm still waiting to get a full set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| And I'm very curious why they disappeared as soon as I filed a lawsuit that was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| based a lot of what was in those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| I wanted to cover that tonight, just to let you all be aware of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| I was going to cover over $100,000 of money that I found, in addition, that you all don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| But since Mr. Weitrich's here tonight, I decided to cover a different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| And I'll save that $100,000 for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| As I made you all aware earlier, Mr. Rockett informed me that he had went to Solway and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| tested the material on multiple occasions, and the material was contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| And he tells me he warned his superiors about it, that the mulch was highly contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| This particular test is on March 14th of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| The fecal coliform bacteria limit was 1,000 times higher than the legal limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| The question is, did Mr. Weitrich know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| On May 7th of 2008, this is from his deposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| As soon as we found out they were tested positive, I told Tom Salter to not only contact TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| but to contact Natural Resources and let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Pull the product out and go out and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| This all took place in the time frame of six to seven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| I told them to contact Natural Resources, pull the products from sale, and then go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Pull the products from sale, contact TDEC, let them know what we found, and to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| up with Natural Resources by doing a site visit and verify that it had all been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| Question, now were any of the customers that had purchased these materials informed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| Answer, that I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| The problem is, one month later, Mr. Weitrich signed and presented to you with a mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| settlement that stated, whereas Knox County has diligently investigated and reviewed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| various recent third-party allegations that the products produced are somehow unsafe or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| present a health risk and believes these allegations to be unfounded and without merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| Why would Mr. Weitrich present you with this after he admitted in his depositions he knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| the mulch was contaminated and that he had been notified about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| So, since he was here tonight, I thought I would throw that out there and see if he wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| to give you all an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| The other thing I was going to bring to you all's attention is I've told you all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| county vehicles parked across from my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Those bottom two pictures were taken out of the window of my storage building looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| across the street in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| You can see a white Chevrolet truck with an aluminum toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| This truck in particular, you can see the occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| This isn't a real good picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| It's digitized, but it appears he's holding a pair of binoculars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| I snuck behind the truck one day, got a picture of the tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| You can see it's GX0891.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| That truck is located, consistently parked for hours on end within 500 foot from my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| hiding behind the swing sets of Ball Camp Elementary School ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| This happened all through the summer of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| And I have ran that tag, GX0891, and it's assigned to Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| So, maybe Mr. Weitrick can explain to me why one of his employees has been spying on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| Mr. Salter has also, I mean, Mr. Rockett has also went on the record and told me that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| has rode along with Mr. Salter while he watched me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Now, I made this statement, this allegation a few months ago, and I thought it was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| and I thought I was took across like, you know, some people took me as being a paranoid nut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| but I never make an accusation if I don't have evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| What's this guy doing at an elementary school playground, oftentimes while it was closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| with no other cars there, parked for hours on end, burning county gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| on my nickel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So, I want to reserve the remaining two minutes I have to see if there's any rebuttal coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| from engineering on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| I suppose not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| You have one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| This is not the way to spend my tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| I know of things that are going on that are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| I know of at least 100,000 more dollars that you all don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| It's been six months and nobody can give you a straight answer about how much money was stolen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| out at halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| I have multiple sets of books for how many tons of green waste they process that vary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| 5,000 and 6,000 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| They have one set of books that says they passed everything and sold it all for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| years, but the records they filed with the EPA says that everything failed and we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| for three solid years and never sold a thing because our products were contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I have the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| I can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| But my major question is, what's Tom Salter doing sitting across the street from my business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| I'm not exaggerating when I tell you my wife has been terrified with this crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| This is inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| But it happens and I've grown to expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| I knew what I was stepping into when I'd done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| But the thing that I've done is I don't always tell all my cards, and you've got to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| what I file open records requests for because a lot of times I've done got those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| And I'm just waiting to see if people will lie, falsify, or withhold or follow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| Brad, you need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Brad, I'm going to ask you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| I know you're in the middle of an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| I mean, to me, this is serious that a person sitting there is stalking or watching whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| That's inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| And Bruce, we need to get an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| But anyway, is there anything that we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| But I don't want to mess up your investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I don't want the people at home thinking we're sitting here on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| The number one thing that I need help on is the original EPA reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| I can cover the state reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I don't have the original state reports in their entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| But I have the faxes that were sent by Natural Resources to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| to prepare those state reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| And they have all the relevant data on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I do not have the original EPA reports for all of the original years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| And who has that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Well, there should be in file in the Solid Waste Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Now, so far, they've told me they don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| But they also told me a lot of other things don't exist that I've got and proven that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Also, Natural Resources should have copies under their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| I can prove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I have a letter from the EPA that says when they inspected Natural Resources back in 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| that they had absolutely all of their EPA 503 records and data on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| So if they had them in the summer of 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| me filing a lawsuit shouldn't have made them disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Would it help if the law director sent a letter requesting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Mr. Law Director, will you do that for us or do it for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| Commissioner, members of the board, is this an ongoing litigation matter, this documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| This is an open record that I'm entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| No, what I'm saying is, is this part and parcel of an open litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| It will involve the open litigation, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| OK, so do you have an attorney representing you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| I do have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| He has sent a letter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| I've sent open records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| They've swore up and down these documents don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| I can prove that to be untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| And I'm entitled to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I mean, they can't go missing if they never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| I mean, oh, these documents never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Todd John never done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Well, how did they go missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| And how were the EPA 503 certification statements improperly worded if they never existed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| And how come I got copies of portions of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| I've got some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| I don't have all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| I filed this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| What happened is I told Dean Farmer on December the 6th that this entire case could be proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| directly from the TDEC file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| The very next day, David Draper, attorney for NRR, signed the file out and inspected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| And the next business day after that, while the case was under seal, Tom Salter, Neil Denton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| Rodney Rocket, Sid Brine, the owner of NRR, and their attorney all met at the TDEC office while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| the case is under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| And nobody's seen these documents since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I'm not saying they got them, but I'm saying that's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Now, those meetings don't show up in the file indexes, but they all screwed up and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| dropped the ball, and this is how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| There's a security guard at TDEC, and you have to sign in, and they all signed in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| a security book at the exact same time on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And I got pictures of the security book to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| And in addition to that, Mr. Draper sent an email to the purchasing department and invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| them in on the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And I have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| They were invited to go all eat lunch at the Green Hills Grill the day after I told your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| attorney who was supposed to be representing you that all the evidence was right in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| TDEC file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:40| And it all vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| It all vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| I got a letter from TDEC saying they vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| I can prove they all signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| I'll pull you up a picture of the, I mean, it's in this file right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| Case summary, evidence, certification timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| Here's where they all met in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| This is where they signed in with security, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Every one of them, while the case is under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| And right here is where Mr. Draper, Mr. Draper requested I inform you of the luncheon meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:21| being held at the Green Hills Grill at noon on Monday, December the 10th, prior to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| TDEC meeting, which begins at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| The case was under seal at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| What are they doing over there meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And where are all the original documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Where are the original reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| And all the ones I've recovered were all changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| I'm going to ask you one more time, then, so I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| You need what now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| I need the original EPA biosolids report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Mr. Law Director, can you request that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| EPA biosolids report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Mr. Law Director, can you request that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Well, you know, Commissioner, clearly I could write letters all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| But here's the dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Either the documents are in the possession of Knox County or they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Either he's entitled to them or they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| This is an ongoing litigation matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| He has an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| The remedy is, I mean, I can write letters all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| You know, if I was his attorney, I would sit there and say, I want these in discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:22| You're not going to give them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| You go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| You tell the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Now you're under the contempt powers of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| But again, I mean, if the commission wants me to write a letter saying, turn over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| documents in your possession, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| If they come back and say we don't have them, I don't know what further assistance I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:37| Brad, would that help you one way or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| If it won't help you, we're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| If the law director would be kind enough to send natural resources and solid waste, both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| a letter and request the original reports, I would greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| That's the one thing I fought for the hardest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| I've got a portion of these records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| I need all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| This is a letter that I got from the EPA files that states, let's see what page it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| Records and reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| All in-house data and records concerning EPA Part 503 were kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| They're telling me they didn't keep them before Tom Salter done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Well, the EPA says otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| And this letter right here was back in July of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| That's before Mr. Salter went to work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| The original ones were improperly worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| I've seen all of them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I know what they say, but I need copies of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| They were asked to redo them at one time because they were improperly worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Brad, we have some more questions from other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Well, Mr. Lauder, I would like for you to get what he is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| It just makes me mad that people are spending taxpayers' time and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| sitting there watching with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Ladies and gentlemen, this is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Two years or two years more this man has been coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| He has never been wrong on anything that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| He knows what he's doing with this and this stuff what he's saying about he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| some of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| He has this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Bottom line, he's trying to save us taxpayers some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| That's the bottom line what he's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| And I'm just I'm frustrated that it's going on this long and that nobody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| wants to get in and put a stop to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| These department heads that have this and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| let's if we did wrong, we did wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| We keep dragging our feet on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| This is Knox County's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Mr. Jarrett, do we have somebody that's outside council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| that's looking at this issue for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| Presently, Rob McConkie in my office has in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| has been essentially litigating this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Pam Reeves was looking into some issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| She's been asked as an independent investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Do we have any kind of I mean, have we had anything that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| share or I don't want to I think this isn't a litigation and all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| public discussion is not beneficial as far as gathering evidence and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| when is this going to come to a conclusion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| She was engaged by Mr. Lockett and communicates directly with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| I have had no conversations with her about this whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| I do know that she experienced a death in the family and that did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| have some delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| But again, what I guess what's troubling me is Mr. Mays has a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| and there's immediate access to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Again, the rules of procedure are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| You can't obstruct if you have documentation in your possession to which the other side is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| entitled, the court will order the disclosure of that under penalty of contempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| And again, you know, any letter from my office is going to have to come under Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Lockett's signature because he's a law director and you're asking essentially the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| to direct an individual who's employed by the mayor to divulge documents that apparently he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| claiming he doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| Whatever the commissions will, of course, it'll be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| However, again, I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| If I was Mr. Mays' attorney, I'd have been in court and demanded it and make the attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| for the other side say why it's not being produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Hey, Brad, has your attorney asked for discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| We covered this in depth in Mr. Salter's depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| My question, has he covered, has he asked for discovery of all the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| We've asked for these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| More appropriately, the judge can, no, have you asked the judge to issue an order for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| We asked for production of documents when we went to the motion to dismiss and prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| to that and during depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| We actually had some documents we discovered that they had withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| After the motion dismissed was, and Mr. Salter testified they didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| And we actually pulled a sting on one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| I actually took one of these documents they swore up and down to me didn't exist, sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| an open records request to the Solid Waste Department, and they sent me another certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| letter jerking me around saying, you know, we can't help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Then I gave a copy of it to Mr. VanGilder of the Hall Shopper, and he's sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| And Larry called him up and said, I've got this document that has totally different sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| of numbers on your green waste reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And I got an email like an hour after Larry made this call, and miraculously they found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| the original 2003 green waste report and sent me one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Brad, my question though is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| We've asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| In discovery, have you went to the judge and said, we're not getting this in discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| We haven't been to the court himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I believe that's your remedy to your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I mean, commission, like what Larry said, the remedy is from the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| We have no means to punish or no means to make them give you a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| Well, I didn't come here tonight for this particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| I changed it because Mr. Weetrick showed up this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| I came to talk about another subject, but since he was here, I wanted to cover these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| while he was in attendance to give him an opportunity to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| And also, it was more than just the subjects, more than what I've brought to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:30| I came here with three prongs in this five minutes, which is now bleeding over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| One of the major things I was concerned with is engineering vehicles that spent a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| portion of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I mean, if that truck was over an hour, it was over there 200 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| I mean, I agree that that's improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| But again, the discovery of your evidence needs to be done through the court commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| can't punish nor force paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| And I mean, as much as I would like for this to be resolved, because I think the discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:08| that we see need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| But I don't think this public forum is the place to resolve this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| The court needs to resolve the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Well, I see we have another question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| It's a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| I should be entitled to it no matter how I apply for it or ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Dwight, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:34| Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a suggestion to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| And as Commissioner Anders has alluded to, I think the key to this discussion is to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| it in the proper forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| So let's revisit a couple of the things that we do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Mr. Mays, as I previously stated from this podium, is a litigant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| Let me remind you that he is suing you and Nassau County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Therefore, the matter is going to be heard and dispensed with at some point in time in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| If he has evidence that any member of the mayor's staff has not provided solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| reports and he can prove that to the contrary, and as Mr. Jarrett has said, motions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| discovery have been made, that would be the appropriate venue in which to provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| evidence and demonstrate that discovery was not complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| This commission's got a simple decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Do you want to try this case in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Remember, Mr. Mays is suing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Do you want to try it in court or do you want to try it in public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Secondly, Commissioner Smith, I respectfully disagree with your assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| I don't know exactly how suing Knox County is supposed to save us money, but thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I also remind you we're spending money on the services of Pam Reeves, who is as good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| an investigator and mediator in this town as there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Why don't we give her an opportunity to do her work and file her report and let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| what the facts say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| When Ms. Reeves provides a report, you can rest assured it will be rooted in the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| Just because Mr. Mays says it doesn't make it true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| He's not under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| He's simply down here under public forum offering his opinion on these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Finally, if he has a complaint against the county employee, whether it's in the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| branch or any other branch of government, he can approach either the office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| in our case that would be the mayor's office, come to Dr. Fogerson in HR, file his complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| provide his evidence, and we'll act appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| This is neither the time nor the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| We can do this every month from now ad infinitum, but we won't get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| I'd like to rebut one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Do you have anything else, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I'd like to rebut one statement that Mr. VandeVeet made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| The only thing I have sued Knox County for is document production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| I've never sued them for a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I have sued contractors who owe us money to make them pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| There's a distinct difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| If I'm successful in my lawsuits, you all get a wheelbarrow load of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| You all get a wheelbarrow load of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| And there's a lot more money here than you all have ever been told about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| There was $100,000 I was going to cover with you tonight I didn't get an opportunity to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| Commissioner Allman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| That goes to one point I wish to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| This is about money in the sense that we may be owed money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| And that point should be stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| We also should stress that there's a public health concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| If material was sold that was contaminated, and there's a public health concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| I think it's perfectly within the realm of the legislative body to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| And maybe we should just keep asking questions until we get answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Granted, court suits will limit our ability at action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| But to keep the public pressure on, I hope people will continue to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Because if there was a public health hazard and the government has lost money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| it seems to me both of those are relevant concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| Need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| And I'm here, and there will be some pictures coming up on your screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| About stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| And if you'll look at this, the guy across the street from me built a nine-hole golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| at a driving range with no permits, no nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| He rearranged everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| This has done been to the MPC, BZA, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| I need to bring it here because if you'll look at these pictures as they go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| this is when it's dry down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| I live on the left-hand corner up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| If you can go on to the next pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| And this is all when it's dry and it's not raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| But if you'll keep going, you'll see the rain when it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| This rain comes off of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| And like right here, if you'll see, they raised that back level back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| You can see in the top right-hand corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| They raised it up seven feet, three and a quarter inches tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| And when they raised that up, they rushed all this water down to this drainage ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| which drains out to the street, which comes across the street onto my piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| And when it comes onto my piece of property, it floods my garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| It floods my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| It floods the underneath of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Now, this is only started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| We have owned this house for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| This has only started in the last 18 months to two years since the man has built the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| which was built illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| If you'll see that picture there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| you can see the water that's just rushing across the road down towards my house down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| And you'll see more pictures as she keeps going along down through of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| water that's standing in my yard from this man doing this production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| And I was up here a couple weeks ago when you all were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Mr. Armstrong was talking about Ms. Cole's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Ms. Cole does have a problem with stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| But at least the person that caused this problem got permits from Knox County to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| their work in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| This man got no permits from Knox County, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Ms. Cole voted for this man right here to keep his golf course as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| Now, I would like to know if my house is not as important as Ms. Cole's creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| My house is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| I talked to Chris Gonjue eight weeks ago, nine weeks ago, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| And he said he was going to send a crew out to take a look at this and see what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| Well, about a week later, I get a call from Chris, and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| I turned it over to one of the guys that worked for him to come out and do an evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| Well, about three days later, I get a phone call from him telling me next Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| which was six weeks ago, we'll be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| This is underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| This is the water that's underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| And he said, I'll be out there next Wednesday to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| and we're going to reclean that ditch line out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| We're going to do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| We're going to raise this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| We're going to do everything and stop that water from getting on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| They've never showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| That was six weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| I called Mr. Gonjue on December the 2nd and December the 11th and left him messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| Please call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| I have water that's underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| My house is settling from this water underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| If you can see that picture right there, the water is actually underneath the pillars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| and the house is falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| The ceilings are cracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| The door jams are dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| The doors are starting to drag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| And it's all because of an illegal operation that was across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| Now, the MPC has decided, hey, he can go ahead and enlarge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| So he's going to add more parking area up on top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| which is going to bring more water down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| When I went to the BZA, I appealed this to the BZA, and I went to the BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| And at the BZA meeting, I called Lumpy and asked Lumpy if he would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| He said he had a flight training thing that day, and he couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| I asked Brad at the commission meeting the week, about a month before, if he could make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| And he said he had tried, but he didn't show either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| That's my two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| When you look at these pictures, and you see the damage that's being done to my home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| and nobody's doing nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| And when I went to the BZA, a Mr. York spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| And come to find out, Mr. York is real good friends with the man that owns Target Golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| And he got this passed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| He got it pushed right on through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Okay, which they said, we're going to look at this as a brand new construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:22| The construction's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| The nine-hole golf course is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| It's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| But my house is being destroyed, and there's nothing that the commission wants to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| My question is, is I know there's been a lot of speak about Laura Cole's property being damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| Is it because she works for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| I mean, this is my home that's being destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Not just a stream that's getting a little extra water and mud in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| This is my home that is being destroyed by a man that did this illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| And Ms. Cole voted for this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| But she has the right to come up here and complain about a little bitty creek that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| being overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I don't understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I don't understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| And I wish that this body could help me in some way to get this guy to revert the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| or to get Knox County Engineering out there to get this water problem fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| My house is sinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Is it going to take my house falling and washing away before Knox County does something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| Or is it going to take a major lawsuit to get Knox County out there to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| Is that what it takes to get this county to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Is to file a million dollar lawsuit, a hundred thousand dollar lawsuit before something happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| Or can it not just be brought up here and say, listen, this is what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Where is the people that's supposed to be helping the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Stormwater is a big issue in Knox County at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| There's a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| There's a lot in West Knoxville that needs to be took up in the Cedar Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| Ms. Cole's property, my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| But these areas, these other areas that we're talking about, that y'all have been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| these contractors have had, have got permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| They got their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| They did theirs illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| The guy that lives across the street from me did his illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| Mr. Conrad, you have a couple of people who wanted to ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| I would actually want to talk to Bruce if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Mr. Weichert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Are you, is this something you're dealing with, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| I'm not, when I say I'm, I know of the problem, but I'm not familiar enough with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| I've not personally been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| I don't care to make an appointment to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| We go out there the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| What I want to know is if, when they do the, no more construction on the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| are we going to make him then keep his water on his property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| I need to go back to the very beginning of this to actually see, to go start from where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| from start to finish to find out if, in fact, he did not have any permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| what permits he may have obtained, what plans he may or may not have submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| I'd like to go back and look at all that before I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| what's going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| I want to see what's going on in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| And because I don't, I don't, I don't know what he's looking at as far as an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| and so forth, but I want to go all the way back to the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| and take a complete look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Do you know if permits have been issued for construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| I do, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| I do not, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| I mean, currently for the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:31| I do not know whether permits have been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I would prefer that if you're going to, if we haven't issued permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| that if he's going to, if we've allowed him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| he needs to keep his, if his new construction needs to keep all of his water on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| I know this is a little, it's just from what little I do know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| it is a rather complex issue in the sense that some filling may or may not have taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| place in the floodplains and there's some things that have taken place over a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| that we have never, that we were not able to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| So, it is kind of a little bit of a complicated situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Looking at this picture here, that, in front of that truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| there is a, I believe, a practice putting green, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and that is higher and that land prior was lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| So, if he's pushed that water in his new construction that's permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| we need to make sure, I'm requesting you to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| that it keeps more water on his property because it is a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Is that, Mr. Conrad, is that kind of a start to the beginning of the process for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| But, like I said, Chris has been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Chris Gunji was supposed to have been working on this 10 weeks ago, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| And it had been passed down to the buck and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| I was confident that Chris was doing something because, well, actually at the BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Chris told me he was going to do one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| He was going to say, no, you know, we want this man denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| And then when Chris got up there, he hollered around about it and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| you know, he said, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| I haven't got all my information that I need yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Well, if you'll call and make an appointment with Mr. Weitrick and he'll come out and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| if my schedule allows, I'll come out and we'll sit down and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| And, you know, I'm just worried about my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| I mean, it's being destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| I mean, if you've seen the pictures, you've seen the water underneath, it's being destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| It's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| I've already know of at least $20,000 worth of damage that's been done to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| And that's quite a bit of damage at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| And if it consists, the damage is going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| You'll call and make an appointment with Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| I'll try my best to be out there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| I turned my light off to keep that answer to your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| You made the reference there that Mrs. Cole worked for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| She had voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Who does she work for and how did her vote get involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| She's in the, she's with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| She voted for him at the MPC for this to pass through and for him to get permission to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| his expansion of the rest of it, which he's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And so all he was doing was begging for forgiveness at the BCA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| And that was, if you look at the BCA meeting records, that's what he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| He, and even they said at the BCA, you're begging for forgiveness on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| And he said, yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| But he had already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| He said he didn't know because he was doing the work himself that he needed permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| Well, he knows better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| In 1999, the man was cited for not having permits for filling in the wetlands in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| He was cited again in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| So the man knew what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| He's not an idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| He's very smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| And so he knew what he was doing at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| So what he did was he was trying to sneak this in because he knew he wouldn't get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| proper permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Stormwater wouldn't have given him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| TDEC would not have given him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| The Department of Tennessee would not give him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| And the EPA would not give him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| He knew this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| But now that he's already done the work and he's filled it all in, we have the pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| of him doing the fill-in, hauling all the dirt and stuff in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| Now that he's done all this work and everything, they don't want to take that away from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| They don't want to make him dig all of it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| Sir, going back to Mrs. Cole there, is she an employee of Knox County or is she a volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| on MPC, an appointee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I think she's an appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| She's not actually an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Well, the only thing I can say is it looks to me like you've got a larger problem than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| Mrs. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| I will have to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Bruce, I have a question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3711)|
| 1:02:02| Now, I know you haven't looked into this, and so there's no specific information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| you can really give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| But, you know, here's my question is, we have a fairly strong stormwater ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| I think we have a great stormwater ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Now, is he going to have to comply with current stormwater standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| Because it's pretty obvious from these pictures that he probably doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Or is there any kind of grandfather process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Is he going to be able to slip through by saying, back when this was built, this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| compliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:35| I mean, and here's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| I mean, I understand it's easier to ask forgiveness than to ask for permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| But what I'm saying is that there probably needs to be a consequence of that, of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| when he is caught, he has to comply with current standards rather than saying, well, this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| fine three years ago when we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| And so that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| If when you all start looking into this, are you going to make him comply with current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| standards or backdated standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Currently, for any new construction, it's got to use current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Anything that transpired prior to the new ordinance being adopted, you would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| able to require them to use the new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| But what's key here is really going back and looking at what approvals either BZA had given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| them or what, because they can override our stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| And essentially, if he went in and did a bunch of work without permits and they went ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| and grandfathered them in, that may have trumped my stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| That's why when Commissioner Andrews was asking me, is I really want to go to the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| of when all this started and find out exactly what transpired, what permits were issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| what approvals were given by various agencies so I know where we stand, and I can give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| a more definitive answer to your question after I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| And I mean, you know, I mean, I know that he's been cut a lot of slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| And a lot of people really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| And he's a nice guy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| A lot of people really appreciate that he hasn't built yet another, you know, subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| or condominium complex that, you know, a golf course does keep it somewhat green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| But, you know, and I understand we need to cut somebody like that a little slack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| because they are preserving some green space, but not to the point where it floods his neighbor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| And I don't want to leave the impression that we have cut, that Engineering Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| has cut him any slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:27| No, no, I mean, I'm talking the legislative bodies zoning BZA, and I understand why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| have over the years and can appreciate that to a certain degree, but not at this gentleman's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| I got one thing to say to that, Lombie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| He, when he was given permission by the MPC, the MPC, and I've got it in writing, stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| that this, at that date, would all be as of new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| So he had to apply from that date to get the permits from the state, the EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:09| stormwater, and everybody else knew permits for that to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| They had to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| So the work that he's already done has to be reevaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| That's my understanding from the MPC that it was going to be looked at as a new project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| Well, that makes it a lot better, because I'll tell you, this body passed a very strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| stormwater ordinance a couple of years ago that I think if he has to comply with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| he's going to have to take care of his water better than he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| But keep in mind, you probably want to consult with a private attorney because if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| been damaged because of this, you know, there's a lot more than just what Knox County can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| You may have been damaged in a way that through litigation, you can seek compensation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| those damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| So you may want to consult with a private attorney as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| We have one more question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Commissioner Brose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I was just going to ask Bruce to come back next month and give us an update on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=3976)|

| 1:06:47| You want it read into the record, Commissioner Luton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4012)|
| 1:07:04| Whereas Chief Deputy Tom Spangler has given a lifetime of service to the citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| County as a professional law enforcement officer, and whereas every day our community's dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4029)|

| 1:07:24| crime, and whereas law enforcement officers of today carry on the long and proud tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| of service built by their predecessors, and whereas the valor and distinction these citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| stand watch over us all and work hard to fight crime and violence, and whereas Chief Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| is among those brave men and women who put service above self and who exemplify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| time-honored law enforcement motto to protect and serve, and whereas Chief Spangler joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| the Sheriff's Office in 1980 and worked his way through the ranks of the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| whereas Chief Spangler was named training director in 1996 and helped to establish the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| Sheriff's Office Regional Training Academy, and whereas Chief Spangler is a helicopter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| pilot with instrument and commercial rating and was involved in the establishment of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4088)|

| 1:08:20| to assistant chief deputy in 2002, and to chief deputy in 2004, and whereas Chief Spangler oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| the uniform division, including patrol, detectives, and aviation. Now, therefore, be it resolved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| Commission of Knox County as follows. The Commission of Knox County hereby honors Chief Deputy Tom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| Spangler for his years of dedicated service as a professional law enforcement officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4119)|

| 1:08:49| Office for the past 29 years. We wish Chief Spangler the best as he embarks upon a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| adventure as a professional fisherman. Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| to Chief Spangler. Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:15| Don't move if you need a motion. I think we've already passed it. I will appreciate all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4155)|

| 1:09:26| Spangler appreciates it, and I just wanted to show my gratitude to, and we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| Ben Harkins down here in a little bit, to Tom Spangler. He has dedicated his life to protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| all of us. And, you know, the two most important things that we do in this community, one being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| education, and the next is law enforcement. Because without law enforcement, and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| the following of the law, then all we have is chaos, and we wouldn't be able to enjoy all the freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4192)|
| 1:10:00| and all the privileges that we have by living not only in this great country, but this great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| community here in Knox County. And I want to thank Tom Spangler for all that he has done for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| all of us here in Knox County. And I thought I'd have, if the Mayor and if the Sheriff would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| to say something. I would just add to that that Spanky and I have been together since 1980, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| I'm surely going to miss him. I would only add that he has spent more than half his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| serving Knox County, and we're all much better for that. He will be sorely missed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:37| It is really nice when you can come and honor one of your friends as well as a fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| professional colleague. And I think I was in office 11 days when I trusted my wife with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| Chief Spangler. We'd had a train wreck in West Knox County, and he took me up in a helicopter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| to look at it. I'd never been in a helicopter before, and I think he could tell by the death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| grip I had on my seat that I was a little bit concerned. But he took care of me that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| and he's taken care of Knox County citizens for quite a while. And Chief Spangler, we wish you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| well on professional fishing. That's not kidding. He's actually going to do that, and I bet he makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| a whole lot of money doing it because he's been successful in everything he's done in life. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| on behalf of our citizens, we wish you the very best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4273)|

| 1:11:38| a part of this community. And I'll still be a part of this community in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4298)|

| 1:11:46| other than going out fishing for some. But it's been an honor, and it's been a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| And I want to thank each of you all for giving me that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4314)|

| 1:14:25| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Captain Ben Harkins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| as they are requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Again, I want to thank my fellow commissioners for sponsoring this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| I've had a chance to work with Ben Harkins, and for many years now he's been very active with the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:59| He does that after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| He is there letting those folks know what's happening in their own neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| what those representatives of those neighborhoods should go back and tell their neighbors what to be concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:15| whether there's vandalism going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| And he's been just a real good friend of the homeowners, as well as being a dedicated law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:27| And I just would like to extend my gratitude for all the many years of dedication to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:37| And I'm sure the rest of my fellow commissioners do that, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| And I'm going to see if the Sheriff can go first here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| Basically, the same thing about Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| I've been around him ever since I came to the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| He also has dedicated more than half of his life serving Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| And, again, we are all better for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| He certainly will be missed, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I have one little added bit of information about Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| When Ben leaves the Sheriff's Office, he is going to be in charge of the red light cameras in the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| So all you Farragut people from the district down there, if you run a red light and get a ticket, you need to call Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| He'll help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| Don't call me, call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| I just put Ben on speed dial after I heard that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| I've known that for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| And Town of Farragut is fortunate to have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| It's incredible that we're losing two such outstanding people in one month from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| Commissioner Luthor was right the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| Ben's been an exemplary law enforcement officer a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| But more than that, here's what I really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| During the Knoxville Open Golf Tournament, which raises money for the Boys and Girls Clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| and lots of youth activities across our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| he's always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| He's spending his time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| It's hot, long days, but he makes it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| And there are lots of other things he could be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| But he has given so much of his time to civic and charitable endeavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| as well as to make our communities safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| So, Ben, we appreciate you a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| And we wish you the very best of success in your new job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| except when it comes to my license plate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| And I hope you'll just sort of overlook that and go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| But you've been a great person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4637)|

| 1:17:49| One that was supposed to know about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4669)|

| 1:18:03| that I've been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4683)|

| 1:22:33| If we set the numbers on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Mr. Briggs would like to be recognized first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| I will refer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| I need a second to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| May I make a request first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| What I would like to do, because this is so important, I won't go over all of this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| because we've been through it both at the finance and the Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| is to split this up because I think that we all agree that something needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| because we need to repair some of the deficiencies in 8-0-5 so we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| And I've discussed this just a little bit with the chairman on the proper way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| I would like to split it so maybe we can approve all except for paragraph C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:18| which deals with the number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| So maybe we could vote first to approve the rest of it and then we can debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| and decide on the number of signatures if that seems to be the wisdom of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| Is that allowable or proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| And if that's the case, what I would like to do is to make a motion that we approve all but paragraph C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| which deals with the number of signatures that's required on a petition for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Let me make clear a parliamentary inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| So what you're doing is, in effect, making a motion to split the motion that we would consider all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| but that one portion and then we will return and consider that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| And then, I don't know, since we're going to require a two-thirds vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| if what we need to do, just so we can get back to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| but let's all agree that we need to fix it because if we vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| and it's voted down, then the whole thing is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| And I don't think any of us want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| We just want to be able to decide then separately on the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Before we vote, I want Erin Lowness to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:38| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| My name is Erin Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| I live at 8306 Tazewell Pike in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| As I understand the recall amendment, it simply affords voters an opportunity to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| or remove an elected official when a specific reason is spelled out on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| I ask you to think about why this amendment was crafted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| In September of 2008, Mr. Bill Phillips ran unopposed for school board in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| He received 3,800 votes and took his seat on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Last December 26th, Mrs. Karen Phillips called for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| She reported that her husband had threatened her with a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| Seven Knox County police officers responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Mr. Phillips reported to the officers that he had taken 30 ammun and was taken to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| Some three weeks later, Mrs. Phillips recanted her statement, thus facilitating a plea to a lesser charge of misdemeanor assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:41| He was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| Had Mr. Phillips received a sentence of just 24 hours more, we would have had the option to file an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| The school board subsequently censored Mr. Phillips and requested his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| Thus far, he has refused and it is my position that this is exactly the kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| that the recall amendment was created for in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| There must be a reason and the citizens need to be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| Last summer, 30 to 40 citizens formed a group for the purpose of recalling Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| We created an informational website, an email address, secured a post office box and a bank safety box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:31| In September, the language in our petition was approved by the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| We understood that we had 90 days to collect signatures from 15% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| Although there were only 3,800 votes cast in that race, we were required to gather 4,000 valid signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| just to put the question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| That deadline has nearly come to pass and I would like to offer my insight as to why we are going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| To begin, the list of registered voters does not accurately represent the actual registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| who reside in the district as the rolls are only purged every six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| My district is greatly rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| We have some subdivisions and some older ones that are partially composed of rental homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| I, however, live on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| My home sits 900 feet off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| If you attempt to come to my door, after crossing the wooden bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| you would find a cattle pedal fence and an electric gate some 600 feet from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| My situation is not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Approaching a door in a rural setting can be a dangerous proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| In my experience, on a good full day of knocking, we were lucky to garner 40 valid signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| My district is the largest landmass and yet it lacks the typical community gathering spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| We don't have parades, there is no duck pond, and definitely not a town square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| We did, however, gather signatures at the Community Recreation League games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| Our greatest success was on days when there was an away UT football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| On Saturdays, most people were not home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| During the remaining weekdays, catching voters home before dark, yet after work, proved fruitless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| In 90 days, there were only 12 Saturdays and we needed 4,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| I can report that those voters we were able to contact were happy to sign the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| We only encountered 6 individuals unwilling to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| Although political activities have been allowed on school property in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| Knox County has decided that now and in the future, there will be absolutely no political activity on school grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| With all the resources that the Election Commission has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| it seems unfair to expect a citizen's group to gather in excess of 100% of the votes cast in a race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5332)|
| 1:29:00| Had we been successful, the need for a vote would be a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| Basing any number of signatures gathered on registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| is basing it on a misrepresentation of the actual registered voters living in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| I actually wonder if the entire process of signatures and petitions is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| And finally, as an elected official, you are held to a certain standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| It is a reflection on you when your fellow officers behave badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| My recommendation for the number of signatures is to be 25% of those that voted in the race of the official in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| To gather that many would still be a huge challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| It only takes 25 signatures to nominate a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| Where is the logic setting the bar so high that the recall option is unattainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| And let's not forget that after jumping through all the hoops, the goal is simply to put the question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| A ballot that gives the voters a deserved chance to choose for or against that official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| A chance to right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| I would also request that the 90 day time limit for gathering the signatures be dramatically increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| There is a one year in office waiting period before a recall can be initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| So why 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| How does the time limit serve the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Why not six months or a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| One minute please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| I submit the current recall option does not serve the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| In its current form, the recall amendment serves no purpose for misuse if it isn't attainable for legitimate reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:36| I would also suggest that not only it should contain consequence for impeding the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| but should offer a remedy when impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| I'll answer a couple of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| Now right now the issue that's before us is to approve everything but the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| One of the things, if we so desire, is that we can increase the length of the time the petition can be circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:15| Probably a year is not impossible because the petition has to be turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| and approved by the election commission 60 days before the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| which if you wait a year before you can start it, then that would push you past the next election date by a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:32| So really about nine months, even if you hit it exactly right, would be the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| We do, according to state law, have the option of making that date anything that we wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| And so if we wanted to, we could extend the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| I picked the 90 days because that was already there, but that is a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| We can make it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Probably the maximum amount that you would want to make it is eight months if we wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| And even then, that might run your deadline past the deadline for turning the petition in for the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| The other issue that you brought up was to have penalties for anyone that tries to impede the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| of collecting these signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| That is prevented in the present recall amendment that we have, and it's going to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| and it is addressed in the one that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| There are laws and there are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| There's no remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Well, there's no remedy because we don't have law enforcement authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| but you do report it to the county sheriff, the county prosecutor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| and state law does have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| There actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| It's under Section...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| It's under Paragraph H...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| I'm sorry, Paragraph I, if anyone's looking at this, Number 4, about who to report if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:57| This is if you see any suspicion of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| And in 3, it's any manner to practice intimidation upon or against any person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| in order to induce or compel such persons to sign or refrain from signing a petition for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| And then it goes ahead and says what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| How does that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| If that impedes us, if we have such a short period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and that impedes us any portion of that time and we miss the number we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| I mean, there has to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| There should be a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Well, I mean, the remedy would be to put your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| is to refile your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| And then start the 90 days over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Of course, you'd have to go back and get your same number of signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| that you would have to do that over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| I just don't think that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| I just think it should be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| You shouldn't have to go through all those steps to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| You have to remember there are certain constraints that we have by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| I'll tell you, I agree with much of what you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| but there's things we can do and things that we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| The two things that we can do, we can change the length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| that the petition can be circulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| and we can determine the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| We don't want to encourage it to be impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| But those are the two things that we can decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| I believe...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| I don't know if anyone wants to make any comments on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| but anyway, I think that the motion on the floor right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| is to approve this up to the signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| unless someone wants to change the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| that the petition can circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| I think it would be up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| I'm just going to leave it the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| because this is what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Incidentally, this is 15 days longer than our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| Yeah, it's 15 days longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| The state, to recall state offices under the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| and out of charter counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| they have a 75-day circulation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| And so we are making it longer than the state at 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| I can go along with the 90 days there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| but I can't go along with this nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| And here's the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| That would give people a year plus nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| to sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| And we make a lot of votes up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| regardless of what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| It makes people mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| We vote on zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| and people would sign that petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| just because they're mad at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| We have to make some tough decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| and I don't think we should make it too easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| to put people out of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| because of some of the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| We vote for tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| And there'd be things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| But I'll go along with the 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| I just think it's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| that when you're trying to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| in one of the rural districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| that 30 days is a tough deadline to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| We might want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| It's 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I mean, I'm sorry, 90 days is a tough deadline to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| So we might want to look at extending it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| maybe not nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| but maybe, you know, six months or five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| I see Greg McKay and Scott Frith here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| I just wondered if they had any words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| or any suggestions or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| to add to the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| or just if you're not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| other than just for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| But I'd love to hear your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| My name is Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| I'm the Administrator of Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| My address is room 214 in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| The reason this came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| is there were a couple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| that we needed to fix in the recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| We need to clarify that it is, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Section 805,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| which has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| in the one that Dr. Briggs brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| The state also recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| that removing the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Shall an election of a successor be held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| And that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| in the version that he's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| And then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| there's the question of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| The way it's written now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| if there is a recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| on the August election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| and the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| in the charter says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| within 90 to 95 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| we'll have a primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| well, that puts us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| past the November election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| We can't certify the election in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| to make the next election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| on the same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| as the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| So we'd end up having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| a general election in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| on November 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| And then we'd have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| another election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| a week of Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| There's no reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| The timing needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| to be coincided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| to where if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| to have another election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| let's do it along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| with the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| When there's a vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| in county offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| it's covered in state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| in Section 5-1-104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| And this applies to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| except for one office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| So the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| the doctor's written this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| is this would do away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| with the special primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| to where you'd have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| two elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| to choose a successor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| instead of just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| There may be a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| when you have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| one special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| There's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| only two chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| When you take state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| and just in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| there's any question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| when it comes to elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| state law trumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| what the charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| There's only two chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| to recall someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| It's in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| and November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| of their midterm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| If somebody went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| and gets recalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| they can only be recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| in the August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| or the November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| is too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| is too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| It's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| two general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| So if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| an August recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| the way it's written now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| you could coincide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| the successor election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| with the November election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| and the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| to the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| would be minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| We'd have to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| an ad in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| If there's a November recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| then you'd have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| sometime in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| but you'd only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| have to have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| if you're eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| for this one office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| And of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| the next question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| is a policy decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| to decide how low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| You don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| to make it too low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| because you don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| and be having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| 10 recall elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| every election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| You don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| to make it so high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| that it's impossible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| Otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| what's the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| of having it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| So that's a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| that you'll have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| We came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| with a chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| of different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| I hope you'll keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| the city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| a recall provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| in their charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| It's set at 30 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| of whatever the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| it was that voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| in the last person's election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| So just for an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| there's a city council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| who you could recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| with 1,225 names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| yet it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| continually happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| someone gets mad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| at them voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| nobody runs around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| and gets recall petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| So bear that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| it's whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| you all decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| we'll be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| to comply with the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| So I asked a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| back in Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| If the recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| was done in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| what would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| that it says here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| that we'd have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| the recall official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| It would simply be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| done by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| or am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| that we'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| have a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| the recall official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| It would simply be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| done by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| or am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| not another election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| should we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| another $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| to $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| on an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| that would occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| for any other reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| we don't hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| The commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| would make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| that appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| and they just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| continue to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| for the remainder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| is that not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| it should happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| can you answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| That's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| if the recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| is in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| then we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| would simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| appoint and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| for the remainder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| of the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| and we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| even have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| have the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| of a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| election after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| They would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| serve it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| make sure I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| in the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| do we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| Okay, and the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| is the first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| of the split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| It's to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| And we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| So we're in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| part of the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| The only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| that we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| debating now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| is the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Okay, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| just debating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| the first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| This time length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| do you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| thoughts on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| an acceptable time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| would be in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| of allowing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| people to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| their petitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| If nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| is too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| is three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| too short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Is it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| basically what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| It seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| that if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| is motivated they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| going to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| and get petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| I just remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| the wheel tax vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| and I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| the hotel vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| When people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| motivated they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| out and get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| So I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| wondering if nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| months would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| a bit long but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| wondering what an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| acceptable time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Well, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| standard as pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| out earlier is 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| But the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| make that more if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| But you run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| the logistical problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| and that is if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| can't be recalled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| first year and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| takes 30 days to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| the paperwork approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| and then you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| to get it in 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| before the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| you simply can't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| one of a year as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| a basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| You brought up a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| good point about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| People had 30 days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| get their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| They had a lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| They only had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| 10 percent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| registered voters to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| do the wheel tax but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| they only had 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| from the day it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| So you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| I understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| procedure now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| You said that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| only one time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| basically you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| recall an official if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| it's a four-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| and that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Really two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| So it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| after the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| if you recall someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| they go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| process and get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Let's say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| petitions are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| When would it be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| At the next general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| And a general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| is defined as one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| that's countywide and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| that's not a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| So there's only two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| elections and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| the August and November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| elections of even years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| So if it was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| August ballot for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| example and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| are just basically voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| whether or not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| recall that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| So if they voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| favor of recalling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| person then it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| on the November ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| but that would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Well, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| The way it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| written I think would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| well, state law says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| that there won't be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| There won't be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| So it would be up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| political parties then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| to select someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| would be a Republican or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Democratic candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| And then anyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| wanted to vote would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| or wanted to run that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| were not the party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| nominee they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| And they would be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| And they would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| party nominee to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| The successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| You said it's 30 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| in the city of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| who voted in that race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| I've got another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| question about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| If you did a district race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| with regards to cost, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| much would that cost if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| you just did a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| And I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| different in each but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| roughly what would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| I'd have to we've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| really done one before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| I'd have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| I'd have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| I'd have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| I'd have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| But if it's in the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| election it's not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Twenty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Well, if it's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| general election it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| It would be the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| an ad which, you know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| But if you had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| just a stand-alone election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| it would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| $30,000, $40,000 for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Yeah, I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| I'm not going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| about the numbers at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| We're going to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| But I do believe that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| proposals that Mr. Briggs is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| making on at least the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| half of that is definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| within the spirit of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| recall amendment that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| brought forward before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| And I was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| sponsors of that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| actually, you know, spent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| great deal of, I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| won't say I wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| The law director wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| But I had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| influence over how it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| And until we get to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| vote, I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| we're going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| I think we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| And I think we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| And I think we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| And I think we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| And I think we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| But until we get to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| numbers, the changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| he's proposing are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| They just clean up some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| oversights that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| We didn't consider how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| much is it going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| to run these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| All we considered was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| what should we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| And I think that at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| until we get to the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| that this is well within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| the spirit of the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| And I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| And seeing no light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| on it, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| important that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| And I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| And I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| And I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Seeing no lights on, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| going to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| call for the question on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| the first half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| And I will reserve some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| time to comment on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| numbers when that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| I have a real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| I'm going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Commissioner Luther who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| A quick question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| How many days does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| charter have written in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| it right now if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| wanted to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| How many days does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| charter have written in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| it right now if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6409)|

| 1:46:53| it right now if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| wanted to change or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| an amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| How many days do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Like we had the petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| back, the orange and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| How many days were they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| allowed to circulate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Well, that's a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| Because with a recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| they have to bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| petition to the Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| Commission and have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| approved first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| So they don't have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| They don't have a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| A number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| We can move now to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| second part, which deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| solely with paragraph C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| And in both of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| committee meetings, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| there were some good ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| And what I had initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| proposed doing, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| was really I was putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| those numbers out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| and I'm not trying to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| one over another, but to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| take 50 percent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| people that voted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6461)|

| 1:48:14| that that was the in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| vast majority of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6495)|

| 1:48:18| codes or Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| 25 percent was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| level that the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6501)|

| 1:48:23| Some required more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| I want to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I did make an error in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| statement that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| I believe it was at both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| the Intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6508)|

| 1:48:30| Finance Committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| I said that it was 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| percent in California in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| the Gray Davis recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| where Arnold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Schwarzenegger became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| That was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| California law calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| 12 percent, not 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| So their standard there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| was 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| And I'm not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| push one over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| But to take 50 percent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| the people that voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| the election, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| require that number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| So their standard there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| was even lower than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| The concern that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| people have, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| the same concern as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| do, deals with, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| there's no argument, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| we want to make it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| We want to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| difficult to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| recall, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| want to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| I think one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| things that we learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| in garnering the 40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| signatures that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| required for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| recent charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| is that you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6551)|

| 1:49:19| The other thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| we learned from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| is that you had a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| of wealthy individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| that contributed a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| of money, and these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| were a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| I believe there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| over 50 names just on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| the steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| And I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| it ended up costing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| I've heard numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| between $60,000 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| They hired outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6575)|

| 1:49:38| those signatures, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| they also had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| advantage, right in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6580)|

| 1:50:36| this, I looked at why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| people are recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| when they are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| recalled, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| looked at why people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| are recalled when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| they are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| recalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Why do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| people are recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| in both municipal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| in state elections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| And it's not always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| but about 80 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| of those are recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| for serious ethical or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| moral violations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| not just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| someone didn't like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| way they voted or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| certain policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| they were advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| I think there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| some very legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| because he was in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| district where not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| many votes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| cast, and he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| concerned that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| people were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| recalled, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| confusion, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| therefore, not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| many votes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| cast, and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| took that 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| percent, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| could be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| hundreds on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| petition that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| circulated for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| recall, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| that's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6686)|

| 1:51:28| had some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| over that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| issue, and so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| 50 percent, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| being said, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| 50 percent is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| twice of what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| in most states, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| it's over 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| in most states, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| it's over 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| in most states, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| it's over 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| in most states, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| it's over four times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| signatures that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| be required in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Commissioner Luthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Committee suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| that we take the, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| think it was 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| percent of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6713)|

| 1:51:55| most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| gubernatorial election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| and use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| I pulled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| some statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| just to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| an idea about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| There were 122,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| people that voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| governor's election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| that voted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| last governor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| And if you took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| 20, I'm giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| some rough estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| but if you took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| roughly 25 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| of those on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| countywide election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| about 30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| signatures from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| the 40,000 we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| citizen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| contacted me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| may even have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| better idea, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| by the way, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| appreciate very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| much, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| McKay, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| gave us this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| information because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| it's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| They suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| that rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| that voted even in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| a gubernatorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| election, which may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| be variable from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| citizen apathy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| and the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| in the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| suggested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| 15 percent, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| take 10 percent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| because that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| fixed number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| will actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| increase as we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| more registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| in the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| and that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| eliminates entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| the question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| voter apathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| For instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| McKay did this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| the very top line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| of that handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| that he gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| if you take 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| percent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| then for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| countywide election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| it would take 26,390| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| signatures, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| still fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| If you look in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| District 4, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| would take 3,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| signatures, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| even in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=6807)|
