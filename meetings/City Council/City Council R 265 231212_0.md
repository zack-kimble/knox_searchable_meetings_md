| 0:18:00| He said, oh, no, I know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Sure enough, he knew all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| And he'd ask about their kids and their grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| And just the love that he had for this city and especially for young people, not just in his district but across the city, was amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| And he's truly missed and loved in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| I just wanted to thank you for sharing him with us all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| And Brenda, I would like to add that Larry was a friend to so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Whether you were, you know, 10th generation Knoxvillian or new to Knoxville like I was once upon a time, he welcomed everybody, was so kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1107)|
| 0:18:38| He was always very supportive of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| And he was a hard person to say no to when he asked you to coach a team or whatever because he was always he would never ask somebody to do something he wasn't doing a hundred times over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1121)|
| 0:18:53| So I was really pleased that he encouraged me so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| And as you may remember, we have the same birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| So every March 30th, he would always send me a happy birthday wishes, and I would send wishes to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| So I will always think of him on March 30th and also the other days of the year because his legacy lives on in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| So we're really grateful that you, I think Councilmember McKenzie captured it well, that your family shared him with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| Because I know he was a great husband and father and grandfather, but he also was a friend and father in many ways to the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1164)|
| 0:19:33| So we're very grateful and he will be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Yes, I just wanted to say that Larry was a friend of mine for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| And he was always a tremendous resource for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| He knew the area very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| He knew the history of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| And he was always generous with his time and answering any question or offering any help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| There's one anecdote that I remember from Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| In fact, don't get too choked up to tell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| But we were one time talking about some issue up in the district and it had something to do with youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| And it could have been any number of things because he was involved in so many things over the years with youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| And when Larry was walking away, I heard him say to himself, he said, I've got to take care of these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| And that was Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| He didn't do it to impress anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| It was almost a pact that he had made with himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| But I never forgot him saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| And that summed him up so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| I've got to take care of these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And he served humanity pretty much to his last breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| And so he was a treasure to the community and we'll never forget him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Councilmember Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Again, I can't say much more than what's already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| But he goes back a long time with me, with my family, and he absolutely was a treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| He was, every time you're around him, he was infectious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| He was contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| His love, his laughter, everything that he dedicated, his commitment, just transcended everything that he touched and did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1284)|
| 0:21:34| And being with him at the dedication of the Christenberry ball fields was just, it was priceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| And just thrilled that he was able to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| So our love is with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| We're wrapping you in thoughts of peace and healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| And thank you for being here tonight and allowing us to share this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| I don't think we necessarily, I think this is going to pass by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| But for the record, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to sign on behalf of the city any and all documents necessary to purchase two parcels of property in the Burlington community for the potential development of a new fire station for an amount not to exceed $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1336)|
| 0:22:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Well, council members, we have several items that are interconnected here, so I'll just share a couple comments as you start this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| As we announced, and Council Member McKenzie was with me at this announcement last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| we announced that I was going to be bringing this proposal to you to have Burlington be home to the city's first new fire station in more than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1370)|
| 0:23:01| So this station will not only provide life-saving fire rescue and medical services to Burlington and all of East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| it's also an important complement to my administration and this council's commitment to Burlington to complement the $2 million streetscapes project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| and also items 11C and 11D are part of my plan to make the Magnolia Corridor a top priority moving forward in my second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1397)|
| 0:23:27| So I will be working with community members, with Council Member McKenzie, with Knoxville-Knox County Planning, with Knox County Mayor Jacobs, KCDC, and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1407)|
| 0:23:37| to create a plan that will catalyze investment connecting the new multi-use stadium all the way to Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| That's almost a three-mile stretch right through the heart of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| In this item, 11B is one additional investment that's going to help catalyze more private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| So I'm really excited about these proposals and appreciate your consideration and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Thank you, Mayor. I was hoping to, if you could, clarify the numbers a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1445)|
| 0:24:16| Since there is $700,000 before us on this agenda item and then later $1.15 million in the budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1456)|
| 0:24:30| I'm going to let Mr. Evans or Mr. Rosenberg, whichever one. I mean, I also could answer, but let's get Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1470)|
| 0:24:41| It's $700,000 is for the purchase of the property and the other $450,000 that comes up to the total of, I think it's $1.15 million in your budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1481)|
| 0:24:56| That $450,000 is for a consultant to assess it, design everything so we can get ready to build later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1496)|
| 0:25:07| And I believe what we have before us are two parcels that are quite a distance away from each other and not at the original location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1507)|
| 0:25:21| Can you help me understand the plans for those two parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| He's most familiar with the real property under negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| Potential for the properties to be used for streetscapes. Just curious that the full plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Microphone is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1537)|
| 0:25:47| It might take a minute, maybe borrow somebody's just hold off or you can go down to the podium also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1547)|
| 0:26:00| We also have a mic roaming mic. Let's go down to the podium. Yeah, that'll work. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1560)|
| 0:26:13| Sorry about that. First time speaking in a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| To answer your question, the two parcels are actually contiguous parcels. They're connected. They're adjacent. They're contiguous to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| So they're separate. They're, I guess, across the street from where the original location is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| They are, they're on the same, I guess that would be the north side of MLK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| Right. Yeah, there's a tiny little, it's actually a fire easement. It's actually not a street there that runs between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| It looks kind of like an alley or a street, but it's actually a fire access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| It looks like a street, but it's actually contiguous with the buildings along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| And then obviously the footprint is larger than what was there previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| If both of those parcels are to be used for this new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| Yeah, I think we would. Well, we, we still need to go through a design process, but I would anticipate that the fire station won't take up the entirety of both parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| But we wanted to have control of both parcels to be able to have that space needed for, to site plan and have access and egress for fire tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1639)|
| 0:27:30| What else do you anticipate might take up that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| At this, at this point in time, there are no plans, no other plans for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| There is, there is some, some of the parcels we're going to need for the streetscapes project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| So right now it'll serve fire station and streetscapes and we'll see, we'll go through programming and design and see what other opportunities there may be for the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| Some other public spaces and other spaces that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you. Before I move to Council Member McKenzie, if PBA has suggested that if you all turn your mics off while you're not speaking that somehow that'll make it easier for the other mics to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:09| I don't know if that's true, but we'll give it a try. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you, Mayor. I just actually wanted to grant once you mentioned the little alley easeway there in between those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1696)|
| 0:28:25| Historically, we've all always thought that was a street because everyone goes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| And to hear you say that it's not a street, it's just an easement that everyone has always historically since I was little used as a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| And so, and not to say that there's not necessarily been a benefit, but I do think by closing that off would absolutely make it a little bit safer as it relates to traffic merging on to either Asheville Highway where it intersects or Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1719)|
| 0:28:58| So, and personally, I'm really excited about this project moving forward. This is a long time coming for investment and beautification in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| But also, it was also interesting, Mayor, when I was telling people about the press conference and asking them to come, a lot of people said, I didn't even realize there was a fire station in Burlington because it's so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1747)|
| 0:29:22| That sits back away from the street. And I'm like, well, where did you think that the fire trucks were? Well, we figured it was coming from Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| So, this is absolutely a long time coming and really excited to see this investment in Burlington. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1769)|
| 0:29:38| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Now you have to turn your mic on each time. I think that only so many mics can be on at any given time, so it was Mr. Rosenberg's mic did work once. There were only a few on, so maybe that's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1782)|
| 0:29:54| Okay. I agree with Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Mr. Rosenberg, this, of course, is a good opportunity to redesign and rebuild and upgrade a fire station. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the ancillary improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1798)|
| 0:30:11| You mentioned the streetscape. Could you kind of expound on that a little bit more so we have a better idea of what kind of improvements may be happening with this project in addition to the fire hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1811)|
| 0:30:25| Well, thank you for asking. The existing streetscapes project already needed to acquire some right-of-way from this parcel anyway, so the city was already with plans to acquire some pieces of that to support the streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1825)|
| 0:30:42| I'll let Mr. Clabo, if he wanted to speak in detail about the streetscapes project, but in general, this site in particular will anchor the streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1842)|
| 0:30:53| Again, we haven't gotten into design yet on the station itself, but we want something obviously that's going to look like an urban scale, urban design for a fire station, modern fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1853)|
| 0:31:05| I think we're looking at a two-bay fire station, fire hall that will anchor the streetscapes development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| Okay. Thank you for that. We've talked over the years about the need to improve this area and steps that will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| This will be a significant step, at least in that right direction, so appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. I just wanted to say that I was able to go out, along with my Chief of Staff David Brace and Chris Howley, Deputy Director of Engineering, to meet with the Burlington community, business community, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1887)|
| 0:31:42| Councilmember McKenzie was there. We didn't reveal at the time about the fire station, but we did share with them an update on the Burlington streetscapes project, which has been in the works for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1902)|
| 0:31:55| Mr. Clabo, it's my understanding that that project is about to start. We've been through the right-of-way in construction and design, but we anticipate that starting construction in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1915)|
| 0:32:10| Yes, that's correct. It should be starting this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| It would be some similar enhancements that we've seen on the Magnolia Avenue streetscape or central streetscapes. Utility lines will be moved off the main street and other beautification and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1934)|
| 0:32:28| It includes relocating utility lines that are overhead underground, street lighting, a new traffic signal, some on-street parking, but it's very similar to what we did with other streetscape projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1948)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you. So just like we do in many other parts of town, the streetscapes improvements coupled with a new fire station, renovating the existing fire station while the new fire station is being constructed, is just going to be more public investment that will hopefully encourage private property owners to know that the city cares and that investing in their own property will be a good return on the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1965)|
| 0:33:14| Just more revitalization in the heart of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you, Mayor. Two things. One, to follow up with Mr. Clabo, has the streetscape plan for MLK changed as far as the utilities are concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2000)|
| 0:33:36| Because I thought that the utilities were going to be moved to a back street but not necessarily put underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2016)|
| 0:33:46| It's a combination of both. So essentially when the project's done, there shouldn't be any visible aerial utility lines down the corridor. So it could be a combination of some underground, some in alleys or adjacent corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2026)|
| 0:34:03| The other thing that I wanted to bring up is just as we're talking about this area, to see if there are any updates on the Magnolia slash Asheville Highway, Rutledge Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2043)|
| 0:34:22| Mr. Clabo, do you have that information at your fingertips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| We completed a study of that area that recommended signalization. So we've taken out kind of the flyover ramp to try to restore pedestrian and bike connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2067)|
| 0:34:42| But that's as far as we've got. So we've got a study. So we've got a plan that we could implement once funding's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2082)|
| 0:34:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you, Mayor. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Was that not also a TPO project as well as it relates to that interchange because that is a state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2097)|
| 0:35:11| Regional intersection. Mr. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| The study was in conjunction with the TPO. The project is in the, if I'm not mistaken, it's in the mobility plan, which is kind of a broader, long-range 20-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2113)|
| 0:35:28| It's not in the current transportation improvement plan. So it's still, we're looking for funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| Right. That was my understanding. I just wanted to clarify that because I know at one point, one of the options was a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| And I know on that particular Zoom that was during COVID, the majority of the people that participated were not, we were not in favor of the roundabout having such young drivers and teenagers not being familiar with roundabout etiquette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2142)|
| 0:35:57| So I was glad to hear that we did not land on that one. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you. Okay. So you're about to vote on buying new land for, buying land for a new station in Burlington. Any other questions or discussion? Seeing none. All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Great news. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2161)|
| 0:36:20| 11C is the resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville to negotiate and accept from Knoxville Leadership Foundation or an affiliate thereof payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes with respect to real property located at 1801 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2180)|

| 0:36:51| Move to approve. Second. Motion made to approve and second it. Any questions or discussion? Oh, I'm sorry. There's a speaker. Miss Nikki Lynn. Miss Lynn, are you present? Okay. If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes to address council. You will have to turn the microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2211)|
| 0:37:11| You got it. Awesome. My name is Nikki Lynn. I live at 4501 Tillery. So I am excited to see that we're seeing more of these pilots and TIFs show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2231)|
| 0:37:32| And particularly not just for corporations that are trying to find tax incentives to move here, but for our nonprofits that are benefiting the folks that are at need the most here in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2252)|
| 0:37:48| So that's the biggest thing that I'm excited about. I'm also excited that it's going to be a renovation so that we're not creating new property, but we're revitalizing what we already have, Brown Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2268)|
| 0:38:06| So that's really important. I'm excited, again, to see that it's a nonprofit that's benefiting from this tax incentive. It's something that we need to expand on further. But again, I'm excited that we're seeing these tax incentives and hopefully we're going to see some more go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2286)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you. That concludes people signed up to speak to this item. Any further questions or discussion? Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| I just want to make a comment that I'm glad to see. I think this is a great project and I'm glad to see that there's a construction timeline max of two years. A lot of times when we give these incentives in the past, there hasn't been that and blighted properties remain blighted and there's some motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2318)|
| 0:38:55| I have no doubt KLF can can move as quickly as they promise. So I just want to applaud adding that requirement as part of incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2335)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you. Any further questions or discussion? Seeing none. All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2346)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| 11D is a resolution approving the park city redevelopment and urban renewal plan prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| Move to approve. Second. Motion made to approve and seconded. Miss Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| So again with the pilots, but in this case a TIF, I'm really excited to start to see these more prominently announced to the public and hopefully utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2372)|
| 0:39:58| Some concerns that I do have. Along with this streetscape, we're moving into an area of Knoxville that should property owners live in that community, we're going to see their property taxes increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2398)|
| 0:40:16| We're looking at folks with fixed incomes trying to afford increase in property taxes. I know growing up where I did in a working poor family, increase in property taxes was a scary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2416)|
| 0:40:32| So that's just something for this council to consider going forward. I am also excited that these properties are going to be revitalized and we're going to take advantage of the LEED certification in making these more energy efficient and more cost affordable for the residents and the tenants that are going to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2432)|
| 0:40:55| Now there is a concern that I have. 57 of the units are going to be four cell condos. Seems kind of fishy to me. How can we regulate how much those condos are going to sell for? That's a huge concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2455)|
| 0:41:18| But only eight are slotted to be for workforce housing. So that's super exciting, but the concern of the 57 units being sold for condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2478)|
| 0:41:30| So those were my biggest concerns, but I'm really excited to start to see, again, more affordable, hopefully affordable housing and these tax incentives being used for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2490)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Council Member. That concludes people signing up to speak to this agenda item. I'll just note that Ben Bentley from KCDC is here to answer any detailed questions about this development agreement, this TIF for Park City. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2509)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Mayor. I may need Mr. Bentley to help answer some questions about this project. One thing I had a question on is there's a section that says if the property is inhabited, KCDC will help with relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2527)|
| 0:42:34| Are there any individuals living here currently? There are not. Okay. That was my first question that I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2554)|
| 0:42:47| My second question was, and let me know if this is for you or not, how did you reach the potential sale price for the condos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2567)|
| 0:43:03| I will give a high level and then I may ask Mr. Nash to come and talk a little bit about that. It's really challenging. In this particular market, there are not a lot of comparable condo sales. I think that's one of the exciting things about this project is it is establishing a little bit of a market in that area so that maybe we can see the creation of more for sale and rental units because people know what that sale price is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2583)|
| 0:43:29| You've hit the nail on the head. It's very challenging. There's a lot of risk inherent with this project, in my opinion, because of that. Also, the timing of sales. There are 57, I think that's how many, for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2609)|
| 0:43:43| There's a lot of, whether those sell in year one, two, or three, and the interest rates involved in carrying those costs are a very high risk point for the deal. I think you're right that 255 is more of a guess than it would be in other submarkets of Knoxville, but it's an educated guess. I'm going to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2623)|
| 0:44:05| My other question is, what's the square footage on these two-bedroom units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| About 700 square foot per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Mr. Nash, if you could just say your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I'm sorry. Good evening. Jeffrey Nash, the Cortland Group, 109 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you. I think that really covers my questions. I appreciate you standing up, but I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2667)|
| 0:44:40| Okay. Any other questions or discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2680)|
| 0:44:50| I will abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Motion carries 8-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2692)|
| 0:45:23| Motion made to approve and seconded. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| Seeing no questions, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| 11-F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knoxville Urban Renaissance Builders LLC in an amount not to exceed $44,450 for the Fire Station No. 6 repairs project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2736)|
| 0:45:49| Move to approve. Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Council Members, just to clarify, this is the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| We'll make some additional repairs to shore up the existing fire station while we work on the new station, because as we know, it takes a while to design and build a brand new station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2759)|
| 0:46:09| And we do know that the current station is already safe for our firefighters to be in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| This will shore it up even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| And also for future, if we put it out in the market, we want to make sure that it's engineered for whatever the future uses may be once the new fire station is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| So that's what this one is for. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| 11-G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a third amendment to contract number C-20-0147 between the City of Knoxville and New Flyer of America, Incorporated, authorizing an increase in the purchase price for nine electric buses and related charging infrastructure for a total purchase price of $10,777,038.72| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2799)|
| 0:47:03| and permitting the parties to negotiate further escalation caps as needed due to the result of extreme economic inflation. Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| Motion made to approve and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| Oh, I'm sorry. We have a speaker signed up. Alexis Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you for being here. If you could start by saying your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| My name is Alexis Gibson. I live at 1828 Silver Cloud Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| I was looking at this because I don't know about anybody else, but seeing almost $11 million for nine buses kind of made me pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| And I looked at it and you have an annual, you're accounting for the 12.58% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| And that capital increase over time because we had it originally capped at 10%, but now we need to go over 10% due to greedflation, like we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2869)|
| 0:47:59| It's not saying that's y'all's fault. I'm just saying like there are powers outside of our control and even the government's control on this pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| I know that there's a lot of push to green energy. I'm a very eco clean person. I buy compostable trash bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| Yes, I buy them from Amazon, which is kind of counterintuitive, but you got to do what you got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| I did the math on this and just wondering if my math could be wrong. I'm not a mathematician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| But if it went up 12.58% and typically we don't drop in increases, we typically go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| So I just kept it at 12.58% year over year because compounding interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| So if right now we've already negotiated from what I think was the original price of $9,422,330.55 to the first year on December 23rd, if I read that right, to $10,777,038.72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2919)|
| 0:48:56| If we just duplicate that increase because it's every year you're reallocating the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| After five years, it looks like this project goes from being $9 million to $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| And I'm not sure how that grant works, but I am concerned is if you guys are going to vote on this year over year as inflation rises and we go from $9 million to $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2950)|
| 0:49:20| Well, that's almost 100% increase over the course of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| And then I looked at batteries because there's a big push for batteries right now and I think that's federally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| But batteries are really bad for the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| They don't do well in cold, especially you can see that with Tesla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| I learned that the hard way when I had to go get my best friend off of Mount Juliet on her way to Missouri in the wintertime in 2021 because the Tesla battery couldn't handle the charge for the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2976)|
| 0:49:47| We know that climate is getting crazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| We know that the colds are getting colder and the hots are getting hotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| So I calculated that right now in the first year, our batteries, because that's what it said is roughly this increase is due to the batteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| Year one, we're looking at $1,354,708 for nine batteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| That comes out to roughly $150,523.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Over the course of eight to 12 years is when you need to replace batteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| So at five years, just the total contract alone to complete, we're at $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| Going with the 12.5% increase, at eight years, each battery goes up to $437,274.79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3019)|
| 0:50:33| And then by year 12, we're at $702,424.12 on battery replacements alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3033)|
| 0:50:42| Now my question here is if this grant is for electric, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| But that's $11 million to reduce CO2 emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| What's our return on investment for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Are we going to rely on the federal government to give us more money to keep up with these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Or is there another alternative that maybe you all considered where we could actually just save up ourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| And yeah, it would take a little bit longer, but we're already in the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| I mean, we're already five years behind on climate action anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| What's another two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Could you guys consider maybe upgrading your bus stops so that more people could use the bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| I grew up in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| One of the places that I did in college was I studied at this church over off of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| Pastor King and Sister King and I tutored at-risk inner-city kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| I still owe a kid there a pumpkin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| I never got that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I have a signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| They have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I owe Jada a pumpkin if she's watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| One of the things that I noticed since moving back was that the roads over at Magnolia hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| The trolley stop out here at the front doesn't have a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| There's nowhere for people to sit while they're waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| There's not really anything safe for children to do, like if mothers with young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| So we're investing all of this money into upgrading stuff that is ultimately going to be a degradation on our financials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| because if the government is just giving us this, or the federal government is only giving us $11 million now and that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| it's going to cost us so much more money in the long term to replace these diesel fuels that people won't be able to use the cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| So I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| Are there other ways that you've considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I know you all are really smart, and maybe you've already considered this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| but I am a little bit worried that we're dumping millions and millions to go out to a contractor who's not even based in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| but we could refunnel that into improving our own city and reducing CO2 levels at the same time and making it more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Mr. Thorn, director of CAT, is here to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| Are there any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| 11-H is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Cornerstone Government Affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Inc., in the amount of $180,000 to provide governmental relations services for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| We do have a speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Nikki Lynn, 4501 Tilbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3195)|
| 0:53:31| So, we're talking about a lobby, a lobbyist for the city of Knoxville at our federal government in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3211)|
| 0:53:52| We're contracting with a professional services firm who can represent the city's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| with the executive and legislative branches of the United States federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| I would like to remind this council what I had asked for at the beginning of August of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3245)|
| 0:54:16| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Any guesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| It was for this group, mind you, I did say specifically Mayor Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| but for this group to push for federal and state legislative advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| And we're paying $180,000 for a lobbyist for the city on the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3274)|
| 0:54:45| I'm just saying when we're talking with, because it's inevitable we're going to need to pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| we need a lobbyist at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| We need to make sure that affordable housing is something that this lobbyist is going to work with our federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3293)|
| 0:55:01| on pushing legislation through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| It's going to be easy with this second piece of the second half of the term for President Biden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| simply because his agenda is the all-in plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| So we're able, there's agency to work toward affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| to getting people into housing to help address the homeless and housing crisis in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| So I really urge this council to push for affordable housing as a topic of discussion for our lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3328)|
| 0:55:39| That concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I was going to ask a similar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Can you address what the priorities are for this role and what it has been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| First, this is consistent, if not lower, than some of our peer cities around the state and country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| spending on supportive help on accessing the funds coming out of Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| As you all know, there's an unprecedented number of congressional acts that have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| that have been sending money out to states and cities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| The Inflation Reduction Act is one, bipartisan infrastructure law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| and our lobbies have helped us access the leaders making those decisions about how those grants get awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3379)|
| 0:56:29| We have been able to get some federal grants in just the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| We had about $4 million that's going to support our urban forest master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| including with great provisions towards equity to make sure that we plant new trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| and make sure they're maintained, particularly in parts of the city that don't have a great canopy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| We got, of course, $40 million towards transforming Western through the Housing and Urban Development Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| which is going to be a transformational investment in mixed-income affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| We got a $1.7 million grant towards ending youth homelessness, and we have many grants pending or about to be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| We're going to reapply for a RAISE grant towards the pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| We have a pending grant for reconnecting communities that I think is for $25 million that we hope to hear about in the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3438)|
| 0:57:30| We hope to hear about our Safe Streets for All grant this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| and we applied for $10 million that we hope to hear about soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| I think that $180,000 towards our lobbyists has been an incredible return on investment for the people of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| It's impossible to measure exactly whether we would have gotten some of these without their help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| but having been across the table from leaders with the Department of Energy, EPA, HUD, the intergovernmental groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3470)|
| 0:58:01| the people at the White House, they're the people who helped set up those appointments and get Knoxville a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| and I think it's a really good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you. That overview is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Yeah, I thought I'd call on Ms. McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| I think you probably went through many of the things that were in her email, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| And I wanted to point out that also, in addition to the grants and stuff that you talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| we annually get millions of dollars out of HUD that we're the local recipient for, if that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3512)|
| 0:58:41| Ms. McAnally, do you communicate with the lobbyists for the city partially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| Yes, Fiona McAnally, Director of Government Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| Yes, I have a phone call, a Zoom meeting every two weeks with Cornerstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| and depending on what grant or what we're looking at, different people from the city, the administration, jump onto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| There's several types of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| There's formula grants that HUD provides, but there's also competitive grants that all the agencies distribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| And how long have we been particularly using Cornerstone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I think it's a newer relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| March 2022 that we signed the contract, I believe, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Yeah, so it's still new, but we have been able to get a seat at the table, as the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| and when you're in line to see the higher-ups at HUD or Energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| and you're standing behind the mayor of Los Angeles, it's a good place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| Gotcha. All right, I appreciate that, and I appreciate your work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| because there's many millions of dollars that impact our transportation, our housing, our HUD dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| and there's constant flux and change in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Yes, Cornerstone's been very responsive whenever we've reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| Okay, appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Mr. DuBose, I'm just going to ask you a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| How many millions do we get out of HUD each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Kevin DuBose, Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| This year, it's a little over $5 million between the CDBG Home Emergency Solutions Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3614)|
| 1:00:25| and some of the emergency monies that we've received, so it's a little over $5 million in entitlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3625)|
| 1:00:35| Okay, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| 11A is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Fred D. Tony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| in the amount of $72,000 to provide governmental relations services for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Motion made to approve and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Oh, Ms. Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Ms. Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| Nikki Lynn, 4501 Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| Again, I don't need to reiterate, I asked for advocacy in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| This is specifically with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| What's our favorite bill right now with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| It's Title 66, Chapter 28, Rent Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| This lobbyist, again, can work on our behalf to negotiate to lobby for the repeal of this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3694)|
| 1:01:45| to help alleviate the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| I'll address the HUD thing later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| This is a perfect opportunity for the city to say, along with other cities in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3714)|
| 1:02:03| with their lobbyists, that enough is enough, we need to repeal this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| Inevitably, we're going to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| I also have a concern, though, for how long we've been working with this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| It looks like, was it 23 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| I didn't jot that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Yeah, 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Has that been on the table, repealing rent control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3753)|
| 1:02:41| That concludes people signing up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I think Ms. McAnally let you all know that Mr. Thompson wanted to be here but is under the weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| so couldn't be here in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| 11J as a resolution, adopting an updated comprehensive fee schedule for inspections, permits, and renewals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3781)|
| 1:03:08| plan reviews, licenses, and appeals for the Department of Plans, Review, and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Council members, I just wanted to let you know that this revised fee schedule is more straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| It eliminates redundancy and is in line with our peer communities such as Chattanooga, Asheville, and Greenville, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| And I wanted to let you know that also we've discussed these revisions with key clients, stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| and members of our developers roundtable, and the general consensus was that the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| is willing to pay a little more for quicker reviews, smoother processes, and better overall user experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| So I want to thank Peter Ahrens and Grant Rosenberg and all the other members of the staff who had those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| listened, and bringing this proposal tonight for your review and hopeful approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| I'm really pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| We've been working on this for a while, and I think this is a great step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Oh, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Mr. Rosenberg, I know we're looking at updating the fee schedule here for inspections, permits, renewals, plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| license, and appeals to plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| My understanding is that the increase is actually helping to fund some of the extra projects that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| or the extra hires and other staff that we need to address our current housing needs and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| So could you maybe talk to us a little bit about – I think that's really – this is a great example of asking folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3882)|
| 1:04:52| to help participate in getting us out of this log jam that we're in with Knoxville being such a popular place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3892)|
| 1:05:02| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| So I don't know if you could tell us a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Grant Rosenberg, COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| The funds from this fee schedule will offset the four positions in plans review and inspections that are in the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3910)|
| 1:05:19| which you'll be hearing later on in this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| There's also some fee revisions we're going to do in our stormwater engineering ordinance that will offset the two new positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| in stormwater engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Those will come later, early next year, hopefully in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| But, yeah, this is a big step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| It's a lot of the challenges we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| Again, software improvements are another big piece of this component that we need to make some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| and make some investments in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| But at the end of the day, it's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| We just need more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| We need more inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Our plans reviewers are spending the majority of their time doing inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| which means we don't have as many people doing plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And that backlog continues to grow and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| We can't turn down work in our plans review department like the private sector can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| So we just need more people, more staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| But a big component, I'm glad you asked the question because I wanted to highlight really the major component to this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| is establishing some benchmarks and some accountability measures in terms of delivering on some turnaround times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| so having some more consistent turnaround times and having a tiered review system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| So for residential projects, seven days, small commercial, 14 days, larger commercial, 21 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=3992)|
| 1:06:40| and obviously the much larger complicated projects are going to be 30 days or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| Having that predictability for the private sector, our clients, is a really big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| and it's something that really they've been asking for and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| I think are willing to pay a little more in return for a more predictable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4014)|
| 1:07:02| I appreciate that, and I also thank you for the commitment to the benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| because that way we can actually be able to show year after year how things are improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| I know Director Aarons has been working on that for some time as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| and I've applauded those efforts, but I think having this focus is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| because in order to address the situation we're in, we're going to need to have everyone out there working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| and obviously we need to work within the bounds of the budget, but I think this is a good proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| so I just appreciate it, and thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| I think Council Member Fugate was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Thank you, Mayor. I just pile on here with praise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| but thank you, Mr. Rosenberg, for bringing this home in the three months that you've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| I know a lot of people have been working on it, but sometimes bringing it home is the hardest part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| and I applaud you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| We'll also say time is money, and this was a pain point we have heard about for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| from our development community and our private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| We want to incentivize them to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| therefore we need to be able to handle all the development requests that they send us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| so I look forward to adding more headcount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| That was what was recommended in studies that we had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| and raising fees to pay for services is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| and what I know from people who develop, they want certainty and a secure timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| because if your rate expires, the whole project can go away if rates move on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| So congratulations to everybody in the city who's worked on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| and it's been a long time coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| and I'm sure there are lots of people who will be very happy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| Thank you. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| Yeah, I just wanted to say I'm particularly pleased with the two additions in stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| I get complaints from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| You know, it gets frustrating when you're understaffed and people have these needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| and of course flooding is only going to get worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| so this was very justifiable to add these positions, and obviously I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Okay, back. We're voting on the fee schedule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| Any questions or discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I move to approve the NCAA's resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| necessary to apply for and accept a grant award of up to $300,000 over three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| with no required local match from Knox County Grants and Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| to be used for salaries, benefits, supplies, equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| and training costs associated with hiring and retaining an advocate for overdose families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Members, as you probably are aware, while the city has gotten several hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| in opioid settlement funds, Knox County has gotten over $7 million to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| and there's more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| They expect to have actually tens of millions of dollars ultimately come into Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| as part of the opioid settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| So because of the significantly large amounts of dollars they're receiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| they are running a community grant process, and KPD is one of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| This is what is on the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| We want to apply for one of these grants through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| $300,000 would be for a family services advocate positioned to work with drug-related death task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| So that's what this item is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| It's a little strange for the city to be applying to the county for a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| but they got the money, and we are dealing with the expenses and burdens of that, of the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| We also are planning to run a smaller-scale grants process in conjunction with our community agency grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4252)|
| 1:11:02| with the several hundred thousand that we have, plus in the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| there's money towards our fire department for immediate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| That was just a little context to explain what you're voting on in item 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| I think we spoke about this a couple weeks ago when the application was going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| but could you remind me what would the advocate for overdose families, what does that position entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4287)|
| 1:11:36| Chief Fortner, if you could speak to that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Yeah, so that's just basically an advocate that will contact the victim's families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4299)|
| 1:11:48| and provide services to them, whether it be bereavement services, give them support groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| health care providers, mental health providers, rehabilitation services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| or any other services that the family may need after the death has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| So at this time, isn't there already a position that does the support groups for overdose families, victims of families?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4326)|
| 1:12:16| Not within KPD, this particular job, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| Okay. So would this be more, would this be an officer or more like a social worker type of role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| It would be a civilian employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Madam Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you. Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Okay. Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2023-2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Motion made to approve and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| I think we have some people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| Okay. Zoe Scott signed up to speak on Item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| Ms. Scott, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| Hi. Zoe Scott, 4013 Heather Court, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| My name is Zoe Scott. I am the advocacy director for Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| We are a local nonprofit organization that works to make Knoxville a better place to bike and walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| for people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And as a part of that work, we have been really proud to work alongside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| on Vision Zero for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Back in October of 2021, this body unanimously approved a resolution in support of Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| And then back this past summer, the city recently published the Vision Zero action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| One of the recommendations in that action plan is to hire a Vision Zero coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| which is why we are so excited to see included in this budget amendment the creation of some funding for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| A Vision Zero coordinator would help the city be able to collaborate amongst all of the different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| that are necessary to achieve the goal of zero roadway fatalities and serious injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| It would help us to advance a lot of these projects that we know that the city is already working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| things like applying for grant funding, whether it's federal or state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| and just in general looking at ways that we can use infrastructure and policy to help save lives on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| I would like to thank Mayor Kincannon and city council and everyone within the city that has worked so hard to help move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| And on behalf of Bike Walk Knoxville and everyone who wants to get around safely in our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| whether they are biking, walking, driving, taking the bus, or using any other form of public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| I encourage you to approve this budget amendment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you, Ms. Scott. That concludes people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| I just want to let you all know that you're all been here four to six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| so you know that periodically once or twice a year I bring you a budget amendment for your consideration as we meet to work to meet the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| and opportunities that arise during the first six months in the middle of the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| I know our CFO, Boyce Evans, has provided each of you with an overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| and various members of my cabinet have been able to answer specific questions that you might have about any given item in this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4513)|
| 1:15:23| Just looking over it, I'm very excited about all these initiatives and feel they are excellent reflection of the city's priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| whether that's through supporting diverse business enterprises and responding to our disparity study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| investing in affordable housing, investing in our fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| There's just a lot of good stuff there. Also responding to the needs of our own team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| I had a meeting with Tom Clabo, Director of Engineering today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| and I'm so impressed with all the work our engineering department's doing and getting so much done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| So like Mr. Thomas was saying, just adding more staff to address the volume and capacity of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| There's just a lot in here that's going to help our city thrive across all sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| So I appreciate your discussion and consideration and hopefully support of this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| Council Member Parker and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you, Mayor. I'd actually like to move that we divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| This would allow us to go through each item rather than voting on it as one budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4590)|
| 1:16:44| And my primary reason for doing that is that, you know, regular housekeeping budget amendments, one time expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4604)|
| 1:16:58| I feel comfortable with during these budget amendments, but those reoccurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| It's difficult for me to support without having that overall budget conversation that helps us understand how this not only will impact our budget in the immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4626)|
| 1:17:20| But but budget planning long term, because, of course, we have many priorities as a city that we all hope to see move forward in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4640)|
| 1:17:31| So that being said, I would like to make a motion that we divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| There's been a motion to divide the question. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| OK, I understand from our city recorder that I think we need a little more specificity on on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| Mr. Johnson or Mr. Swanson, could you, Mr. Swanson, could you help me get some information about how you intend to divide the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4674)|
| 1:18:04| Do you intend to vote on each individual item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4684)|
| 1:18:12| Yes, that's that's the only dividing of the question that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Well, no, there's a number of ways to divide it. You could you could single out one or two items that you wanted to vote on individually and then vote with the rest as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4697)|
| 1:18:28| Or you can go each individual question. And that's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| There are no specific items that I'm trying to highlight. I'm trying to give space for each item to be considered individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4716)|
| 1:18:46| All right. OK, so there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| Council member Ryder, were you wanting to speak to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| OK, any other questions or discussion about this motion? Seeing none. All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| Any opposed? No. Motion fails. Back to the original motion, which is to consider the budget amendment in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| Council member Ryder. Thank you, Director Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| I just had a couple of questions. The Vision Zero position that will be within your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4762)|
| 1:19:31| How exactly do you I know maybe this is early. How do you exactly think that will be working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| So the the intent of that position is to implement the action plan. So we've got several priorities within an action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| So we don't with current staffing, we don't have the capacity for someone to be dedicated to to implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4786)|
| 1:19:53| So that that's really the intent of that position is for someone that wakes up daily looking at that action plan and working with within engineering and other departments to implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4793)|
| 1:20:05| OK, so are they and I'm sorry, I can't recall the action plan off the top of my head, but are they looking at the action plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4805)|
| 1:20:12| But are they also looking at individual projects and how Vision Zero goals are worked into individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| So so part of the road improvement projects, part of the action plan, we identified a high injury network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| And so based on on that high injury network, this person would develop a dashboard and kind of drill down into those areas that are identified as high injury networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4826)|
| 1:20:38| So the high injury networks is maybe a 30,000 foot level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| We need somebody that actually gets into the details of the crash reports and figures out exactly what those issues are and then works within the engineering department or other departments to figure out projects to help to correct those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4841)|
| 1:20:54| OK. Council Member Ryder, I just would add that this person is not going to be required to have an engineering degree and maybe someone with a planning background or policy background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4854)|
| 1:21:06| But because Vision Zero's principles are that many of our streets can be made safer through design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| That's why we want to have the position embedded within engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| They may well have an engineering degree, but they may have also a background in other disciplines that will help help us move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| OK, and just this is not necessarily for Director Clabo, so I'll let you off the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| So there are several different positions in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Some of them are engineering, something or another level one, technician level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4895)|
| 1:21:46| I know the Vision Zero coordinator is not an existing, that's a new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| Are some of these civil service and some of them aren't civil service, so we don't have to vote to add them to anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| We're just voting on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| That's more of an HR question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| They're all civil service positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| So we don't have to vote on them. We're just voting on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| We don't vote to add them to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| So David Bryce, Chief of Staff, if we need to create a new position, it will come before you to create the position, but we need to have the funding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| So some of these positions may be existing in the classification system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| Some may need to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| I know that the mayor and his Vision Zero position may be very specific to a newly created position, but you will see any newly created positions, and we do that throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4941)|
| 1:22:30| So we may see some of these things come back in that form as HR type amendments or civil service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| Yeah, the Vision Zero coordinator was actually in a previous council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| It's already been approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| So actually they're in the process of hopefully posting that in the next month or two, but next month hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| I have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Upon approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| I appreciate the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Oh, and the one other thing was one of the items in here is the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| Sorry, I'm trying to find it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Funding for the empathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| Is that supposed to be empath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| That's at the 1515 St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| Empath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| It's empath, not empathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| No, this is the funding that the city and the county and the state put in for our mental health facility to try to help take people from emergency rooms and get them mental health care quicker at 1515 St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5002)|
| 1:23:36| As McNabb got into that project, they ran into some mold and some additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| So this is to cover half of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Knox County is covering the other half of those costs to get this project completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| It's currently under construction, but it is the empath unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| So it's a typo in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| That was Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Listen, they took one of the bathrooms at where I worked at Pellissippi and turned it into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| It wasn't called empathy, but it was a room that you could go and a comfort room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| So I just the way it's worded here and it's not capitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| I didn't know if there was a room where you could go and have some empathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| I didn't quite know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| And I was just asking for some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| I want to point out the typo council member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| I know you're more comfortable with numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| So we'll start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| I have one question to follow on our conversation over e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| It's my understanding that some of these dollars come from our unassigned fund balance, but our revenue projections have been eclipsed with more revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5075)|
| 1:24:45| And so the net effect to our unassigned fund balance is zero or positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5085)|
| 1:24:53| Can you explain the impact to the macro level budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| At the high level, this increases the total budget by around 5.8 million, just shy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| It uses $5,084,000 and some change from the general fund unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| And that brings the general fund unassigned fund balance down to $41,753,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5112)|
| 1:25:21| That's where we're left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| And the reason it comes down to that number, you may say, well, that sounds like higher than what I heard during the midyear projections and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5123)|
| 1:25:32| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| And that's because local option sales tax and state shared sales tax continue to come in higher than we projected for FY23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5133)|
| 1:25:43| And higher than this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| You were abstaining on the budget amendment because of the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| So motion carries 8-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Oh, 8-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Mr. Johnson, you do the counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Ms. Parker's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Ms. Testerman's an abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| Everyone else was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| 12B is an ordinance amending Section 4-78BII of Chapter 4 of the Knox City Code to clarify submission of remedial plans and fines for sales to underage persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5185)|
| 1:26:38| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Bureau Board Chair Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| I would just like to request that this be passed on emergency based on the housekeeping nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5206)|
| 1:26:55| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| So make a motion to amend for emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I'm making a motion to amend to vote on this item on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Motion to hear this as an emergency item has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| Council Member Testerman, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| What will be the, if this were to pass, what would be the notification to all beer permit holders' businesses that this is going to affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5240)|
| 1:27:30| Because it states here in Section 2, the ordinance shall take effect from and after the passage of the Welfare of the City requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| So what's going to be the notification plan to them that this is changing if it's passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| To refresh everyone's memory, this was an extensive rewrite and I worked on it with Allison Dyer and the City Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5267)|
| 1:27:55| and we accidentally left out three or four words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| It's or pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| And when the law department had an underage sale issue come up and they were applying the newly revised ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5281)|
| 1:28:10| it was realized those three or four words were omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| This is an ordinance that's on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| This exact same language, for whatever reason, didn't make it over from the old version to the new version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| so we're just making it consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| So more of a housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Okay, I thought it looked very, very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Something's obviously changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| All right, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5314)|

| 1:28:45| Oh, that was just a motion to hear it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Did everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| Because I was a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Okay, now back to the original motion as amendment to hear it on emergency, which means it's just done on one reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5342)|

| 1:29:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Inoxicacy Code, Chapter 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| to transfer animal control unit functions to Young-Williams Animal Center of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| and to modify the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| I move approval and ask that it be on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| Okay, well, I think you have to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| So I'm making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Okay, is there a second to the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Okay, motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Then I would like to amend that motion for emergency to read it on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| which is what we talked about two weeks ago when we deferred this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| Okay, now the motion has been made to amend it to hear it as an emergency item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| Is that motion to amend seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to hear it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| We do have several people signed up to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| so we'll go to the public comments and then come back to further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| First up is Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Mr. Birmingham, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| My name is Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| I'm the board chair for Young-Williams Animal Center, 3201 Division Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| I guess I'd like to start off by saying thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you to this body, the members of the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| and on behalf of the board that I represent, I want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| Two weeks ago you approved a resolution to move animal control under the oversight of Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| I think it's an important first step to improving animal welfare in both Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| and the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| I'll be very brief, but I have a few remarks that I would like to make for the record on behalf of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| As you may know, by consolidating the functions of three agencies under one operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| the community would benefit from a shared set of goals and objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| to provide a united, cohesive, and best practice approach to animal and public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| that are based on strategies that have proven to be successful across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| For the Knoxville Police Department, this move would eliminate animal-related complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| create an opportunity to add manpower to other unstaffed areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| and reallocate savings to resources specific to improving our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| It's much easier to bring an animal into the shelter than it is to keep it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| That's why our goal is to provide city and county residents with a community-minded approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| to animal control services that proactively helps pet owners be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5493)|
| 1:31:41| and provides needed resources to keep pets in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Young Williams has already become a national model with our save rate and innovative programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| which is why we want to assume the remaining piece of the animal welfare pie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| to be the full-service national model and a humane city that gets it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| At the end of the day, we're invested in making Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| one of the country's most pet-friendly communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| and fulfilling the vision of a home for every pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| Thank you for your consideration to amend the city code to transfer animal control to Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Thank you, Mr. Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Next person to sign up to speak in favor of Item 12C is Dr. Becky DeBolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| Dr. DeBolt, if you could state your name and address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| I'm Becky DeBolt at 1216 Bowman Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| I'm Dr. Becky DeBolt, a shelter medicine veterinarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| and I teach over at the UT College of Veterinary Medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| Thank you for considering the transition of animal control responsibilities to Young Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| You've heard from a lot of people, leaders, and read the recommendations already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| and I do believe that this is the right plan for our community's pets and pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| To dig a little deeper, the proposed model of animal control, what they call field services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| would be a significant step forward towards improving animal welfare for the entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| along with a reduction of stray pets in both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| As a shelter veterinarian, I'm involved with cooperative efforts to provide animal care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| which begins with pet owners and their pets, but includes outreach programs, animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| Young Williams Animal Center, along with other animal welfare organizations in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| and veterinary professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| These groups all have to communicate really closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| and work closely together to provide a functioning network of care for the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| So taking the step to consolidate animal control with the rest of the services provided by the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| is a critical step for these collaborations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| It'll vastly improve communications, it'll improve efficiency and pet outcomes at the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| and it'll minimize the number of animals coming into the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| which is really important from my professional perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| Beyond the logistics, it would align animal control services with the shelter's mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| to improve the state of animal welfare in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| by placing or hopefully keeping pets in their permanent homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| And keeping pets in their homes is a critical, really crucial point from the shelter medicine perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| If everyone in that care collaboration has an explicitly shared goal to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| we'll see immediate progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| We'll see fewer animals in the shelter, reduction in disease, humane education in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| which will lead to better pet owners and less complaints from neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| and then absolutely it'll lower cost burdens to the municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| So this affects folks who don't have pets as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| These services will enhance our city as a whole and reduce the strain on resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| which I'm acutely aware of from the shelter perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| and improve our standards of living over time for the humans and the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| So thank you for your time today and for your careful consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| and I hope you'll support the vision to make us one of the best places for pets and their humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5730)|
| 1:35:38| Thank you, Dr. DeBolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| The third and final speaker on this item is Jim Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you, Jim Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| I'm a Nosh County resident that resides proudly in the city of Noshville at 4004 Tyspoo Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| and thank you for the opportunity to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| I usually show up down here about every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| I believe in representative government, and I've searched my candidates, and I expect them to do good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5766)|
| 1:36:14| but when something happened that confused me a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| something that the county passes with no problem, and we're postponing for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5777)|
| 1:36:26| I've lived here a long time, and the county, to get agreement between the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5786)|
| 1:36:34| and the sheriff's deputies is, as we used to say in my neighborhood, that's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5794)|
| 1:36:42| I'd vote that before they changed their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| I'm a big supporter of young William.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| I don't support much, don't have a lot of support, but I do love that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| and that's where my animal, and the most impressive thing, when I was a youngster in Noshville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| they had dogs with rabies and vomit out the mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| They call it a dog pound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| They take them down about four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Nobody picks them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| They euthanize them because they couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| And Mrs. Heffsman and her crew, I've known Janet a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| It's hard to say no to her when it comes to money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| and she does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| And so hopefully, there's always, you can pick at any deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| I can find fault with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| I think my employees think that sometimes, you know, if they want a raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| I try to talk about their shortcomings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5859)|

| 1:37:47| The police department, you know, they can't even go to recs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| They're so short-handed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5871)|

| 1:37:55| I saw a cat, and they come out and pick the cat up, and it's got ringworms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5875)|
| 1:38:03| and I think she looked like she's expecting a litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| And we called down to the, it was two or three days out in the cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| and people feeding it, and I called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| They picked that cat up, and I've kind of got an interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| I got attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I'm more of a dog person, but I called Ms. Tessman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| and told her to check on that young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| So she said don't worry about it, and I will tell you, whatever the bill is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5908)|
| 1:38:35| send it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| So I know you will anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| But she's done good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| This is a win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| If there's some things wrong, we do it at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| We straighten it out as we go, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| But this, I couldn't understand the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| I just couldn't do it, so I had to come down and talk maybe later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| That's why we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| You know, usually I can't say hello in five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| but I want to thank you all for your service, and I hate to stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| so as Constance says, I'm going to yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you, Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Council Member Tessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| I appreciate everybody's consideration of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| and I'm on board with the changes, kind of in going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| I know the primary changes are to the configuration of the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| I would like to say that after consideration and looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| and really for the benefit of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| I would like to make a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| Yeah, let's maybe discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| and take a vote on the reading on the emergency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| That's on the floor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| and then we'll come back to you for your other amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Is there any question or discussion on reading this as an emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| All those in favor of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| Council Member McKenzie, reading it as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| So I don't have an issue per se with reading it on an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| but I do have a question that could impact my yay or nay on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| Okay, what's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| So my question would be to Ms. Tessman with her day job hat on as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6045)|
| 1:40:53| I know that there were quite a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| I just want to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| did you and the board have ample time to review the revisions that were submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6059)|
| 1:41:08| Which board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Young-Williams board, not the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| I mean, my board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| Mr. Birmingham is your board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| And so I've been in communication with our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| and they have been in support of how we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| I just wanted to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| Any other questions or comments on the amendment to read this as an emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| There's a lot of confusion on what we're voting for and what we're whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| I'm just going to say we are voting on a motion to pass this on an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| and I'm not going to support at this moment to pass it on an emergency because we haven't had the discussion to vote about what we're even passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| So since that's the question that's being called, I'm going to vote no on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| And I just wanted to be clear to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| And then this isn't germane to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| So I'll just be quiet and leave it at that for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Any further questions or comments on, and also we don't, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| we can discuss more of the substance before we vote on the emergency part if that's the council's preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6146)|
| 1:42:33| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| Just, Mr. Johnson, just remind me to address the, Ms. Fugate, do you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| How do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Well, I think it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| But how do we not vote on that to then go into discussion where other amendments may be answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6171)|
| 1:42:59| If lawyers can tell me we're good to do that, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| But I assumed that motions would, amendments would be made and that whatever we wound up with would be on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6183)|
| 1:43:14| Who put forward the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| You did the one to do first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Ms. Fugate, it's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Yes, it's my motion because two weeks ago we said we would be willing to hear it on emergency so that whatever we came up with tonight could take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6201)|
| 1:43:35| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| There is a motion on the floor pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| And that motion is to amend this to make it an emergency measure so that it would be adopted on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6220)|
| 1:43:48| Now, if the will of the group is to discuss amendments, other amendments to the proposed measure before you do the amendment to emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6228)|
| 1:44:02| you can do that, but you have to have a withdrawal of the motion to amend to emergency first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| So we would have to require a withdrawal of the motion, a temporary withdrawal of that motion, as well as a temporary withdrawal of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6249)|
| 1:44:20| Okay, thanks for the rules interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| Okay, I will temporary withdraw, but know that whatever comes out of this, I am making it a motion to whatever it is we do it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6265)|
| 1:44:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Okay, the motion to amend has been temporarily withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| Temporary withdrawn, but it's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| I think I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Do you withdraw the second temporarily also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| I second, withdraw, withdraw the second, all the combinations of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| I'll go back to Councilmember Testerman because you had a proposed amendment you were about to state before we went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| There's an original motion on the floor to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| Lauren, why don't we go to you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| I mean, Councilmember Ryder, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Not to jump the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| We've gotten so many carts before various forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| Let me be clear for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| In the packet, there's the original ordinance, which we have a motion and a second on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| Then there's a revision that was worked on with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| And that is, I believe, what Councilwoman Testerman wants to discuss and possibly make amendments and discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| But we don't have it acknowledged, and we don't have a motion on it to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| So that's, I guess, what I'm being called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| But I want to make a motion to approve the revised revision so we can discuss those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6348)|
| 1:45:56| And then I'd like to say something before I hand it over to Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| I'm making a motion to introduce the revisions that are in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| Hopefully people saw them in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| And I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| In the packet, we see highlighted in yellow and then light and strike lines through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| That is the changes that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| I've got to put my glasses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| It starts on, according to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| Blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6389)|

| 1:46:34| In our packet, this agenda item is 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| Under 12C, there's the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6398)|

| 1:46:46| No confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| That is what we have a motion and a second on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| I'm making a motion, and only if there's a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| can Councilwoman Testerman continue on to talk about revising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| exhibit to the ordinance revised, which is part C under 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| I'm making a motion to introduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| And I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| I just wanted to make sure that we were all looking at the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| As you go through your packet, when you see the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| you'll see highlighted in yellow and then also things added or crossed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| And they're all highlighted so you can see where the changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| And so that's all I was just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| So I'll make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Mr. Swanson has a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| I'm sorry to be a little technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| But what you're actually making is a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| What we've got before us is the original ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| You're moving to amend the ordinance to include the revisions that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| what's in your packet listed as the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| It's up at the top of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| It's the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| And there are about five different changes that have been listed in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| summary that's at the very end of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| I would like to make the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| With the revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| With the caveat that there is a typo in the proposed revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| No, tell us what that typo is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Well, I don't know if Mr. Roberto for clarity needs to say second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| I'll say second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| If everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Can we just vote on the motion to amend and then you can address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| I think we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| We're not voting yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Let's not put the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| We're going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| A motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Because Councilwoman Tesserman wants to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I don't want to have voting before we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| So the amendment, the typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| Is on page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| So if you click and open up exhibit to the ordinance revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| Page 20 of the 44 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| There's a double strike through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| Of Knox County humane society and animal shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| The double strike shoot through should stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| It is carried over to Knoxville veterinary Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| That is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| That would make there be six members of the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| Not seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| The math doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| So the strike through went too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| So just everybody understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| And I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| Huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| I'll make a motion to amend the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| To not strike through that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6570)|

| 1:49:33| An amendment to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| To unstrike out the words, Knoxville veterinary Academy on the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| page four 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| And the revision page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| And there's been a motion made to just fix that typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| Does everyone understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Everybody knows what the amendment is correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Does the council want to vote on that typo fix right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Okay, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| All those in favor of fixing the typo, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Motion carries now back to the, the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| As described in this part of your packet that says revised and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| yellow highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6616)|

| 1:50:21| has comments to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| I just want to say to all those who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6629)|

| 1:50:35| Animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Two young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| At the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| So that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| And to respond to the question about why this didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| The same pace as it might've at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Is there additional layers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| At the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6652)|

| 1:51:01| And so that's what the postponement was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| It was not about transport transferring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| I would like to commend the director of the young Williams animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6666)|

| 1:51:57| needed to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6717)|

| 1:52:05| Then there was also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| If you look in the summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| which is part, the summary of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| So many of these parts are not contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| There's just a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| The animal shelter definition has been changed to add them the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| the activities set forth in Section 553 because it didn't give them that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| And that's what we're doing, so that needed to be correct so that they have that responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| And then my point in postponing it, other than those were things that came up in discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| with the law department, is that at the top of page 20 in the revised part, the appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| actions, whether there are frequent or infrequent appeals actions, are now with the Animal Control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| And specifically on page 20 at the top, it says, Part B, it says there's also created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| an independent board designated the Animal Control Board, which have the function and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| responsibility of recommending goals and objectives relating to animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| And to be an independent board, the board can be attended by and have members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| animal shelter as part of their business, but not as voting members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| And so that's what the changes are, which is to not include employees, board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| affiliates, or agents of the animal shelter on the Animal Control Board to maintain its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| independence as a board, as stated in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| And I will turn my light off and give Councilwoman Testerman her opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| So, as we are specifically speaking to the revised vision of the ordinances, as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6829)|
| 1:53:57| preemptively is that, you know, I'm on board with them, I'm fine with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6837)|
| 1:54:05| My only thought is that to be more beneficial to the new configuration of the board, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6845)|
| 1:54:15| like to make a friendly amendment that Young-Williams Animal Center be added as an ex-officio non-voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| member, really to bring subject matter expertise to the table as a resource and to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6863)|
| 1:54:33| the board with regular updates and to have that particularly regarding the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6873)|
| 1:54:41| goals, objectives, training, those types of things are being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| So really as a matter of bringing subject matter expertise to the board to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| have Young-Williams at the table as an ex-officio non-voting member in order to contribute to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6891)|
| 1:54:59| discussion and to keep that board informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| Councilmember Testerman has made a motion to amend, to add an additional member to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| Animal Control Board who would be a non-voting member representative of Young-Williams Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| Shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Is there a second to her motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| A motion has been made to amend to add that role has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| Non-voting member of Young-Williams on the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| Councilmember Testerman, did you have anything to add at this juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Yeah, I just would like to ask Mr. Swanson, so the language as it reads right now in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6942)|
| 1:55:55| ordinance is that this is an independent board designated the Animal Control Board and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| goes through what the goals and objectives or what the responsibilities of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| is on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| Two question, a two-part question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| Does the shelter, by the shelter having an ex-officio board position, does that maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6976)|
| 1:56:26| independence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| And then the second part of the question is, do they need to have an ex-officio board position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| to be able to advise and inform the board that is recommending goals and objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| recommending qualification requirements, recommending specialist training courses, etc., as listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| The answer to your first question is yes, they can maintain their independence and still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| have an ex-officio member, non-voting member who comes from Young-Williams Animal Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| The answer to your second question is no, they don't have to have an ex-officio member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| of the board in order to provide their expertise to the board, but it's really just a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7032)|
| 1:57:21| matter of whether you want to have that person from Young-Williams as an ex-officio member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| of the board or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| So in asking Councilwoman Testerman about her amendment, that would be not, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| be in addition to the seven voting members, your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| Sorry, there's a deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7060)|
| 1:57:48| Just as a point of information, Mr. Frost, ex-officio and non-voting are not synonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| Ex-officio means by virtue of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| Non-voting means non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| You can be ex-officio and vote, but I think the intent is non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Just, I've learned that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| Are both necessitated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| You can be a designated non-voting position from a representative from Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| Animal Center who's non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| Ex-officio just means Latin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| It means Latin from, it means from the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| Like I'm on a lot of boards, not because I'm Indy at Kincannon, but because the mayor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| the city of Knoxville is on these boards, and some are voting and some are non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| So that's just, I mean, a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| There's other people with their lights on, so I'll turn it over for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| I'll take it, and then Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| I'm in favor of the amendment to have someone from Young-Williams be ex-officio and non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7121)|
| 1:58:54| Serving positions where oftentimes whoever is actually implementing the work has someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7134)|
| 1:59:04| on the board ex-officio because sometimes they're the only person that can answer some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| questions that the board needs answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| If they can't vote, then they in no way will tip the balance of the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7154)|
| 1:59:21| The voting members would still be seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| It would leave a four-person majority, and quite frankly, I don't see any harm with having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7163)|
| 1:59:32| the body that we've asked to manage animals for us in the city to have an ex-officio seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7172)|
| 1:59:40| and a non-voting seat on the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie, and then Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| I totally agree with Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| I do feel like there is a huge benefit in having someone who has a level of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| to sit on the board as advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| This is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| What we voted on and what we're agreeing on to shift these responsibilities and duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| it's huge and should not be taken lightly, and I think that I'm absolutely in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| of that amendment to have someone with that level of expertise there to advise the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Yeah, I'll just add the same comments that I think it's important the way that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| structured that we have, I think, some of the good changes that have been made is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| we've separated authority of decision-making, i.e. voting, but I think I like this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| because it includes built-in expertise of the operational team that's going to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7241)|
| 2:00:47| it, and so I think it's a good way to inherently include that expertise and, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7247)|
| 2:00:55| create separation and objectivity of the voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| So I like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| Not to get everybody too excited, I was going to call the question on this amendment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| Councilwoman Testerman, but Mr. Frost has some proposed language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| I've been listening to people talk and heard what Councilmember Testerman proposed, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| we need some language to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| So I just wrote it off the cuff, so feel free to critique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| So it would be under, it's on page 416 of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| It's also page 20 of 44, section 5.2, and it begins with what's double-underlined in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7293)|
| 2:01:43| the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| No member of the board may be an employee, board member of, affiliate, or agent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| animal shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| You would say no voting member of the board would be an employee, board member, or affiliate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7309)|
| 2:01:56| or agent of the animal shelter, then after that, add the sentence, there shall be a non-voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7316)|
| 2:02:02| member of the board that is affiliated with Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| The Young-Williams Animal Center representative shall be appointed by Young-Williams and shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| serve a term of identical length of the other board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| It's Councilwoman Testerman's motion, so I'll turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| I feel that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| I think that covers the addition and what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| Okay, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| Councilmember Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| I have a question about the term limit issue because, well, but he said the exact same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7354)|
| 2:02:43| term, which implies there is a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Are they infinite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Councilmember Fugate, at reading it, it's a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| So an appointed person by, I mean, are there term limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| I'm just thinking about the way this works because I can see the Young-Williams board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| appointing their CEO to represent on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| Does that mean after four years, Young-Williams could not reappoint their CEO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| Councilmember Fugate, there are no formal term limits, and these are some very specialized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| positions that I can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| I know, but I want this to be very clear because I don't, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| Councilmember, indeed, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| Yeah, I had constituents that asked about term limits for these board positions because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| lots of other boards that serve the city have term limits, and I did not ask for term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7415)|
| 2:03:43| because some of them are from specific agencies, and there's not necessarily the depth to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| able to, or staffing, to be able to replace people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| So I'm not pushing for term limits on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Obviously, if council or the city at some point decides that they want the Animal Control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| Board to have term limits, that's not something I'm advocating at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7441)|
| 2:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| The motion on the floor is about, is Councilmember Testerman's amendment about a new non-voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| member as, you know, as Mr. Frost set forth in better language than I can recall at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Does anyone have any questions or comments about this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| Okay, the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| So now we're back to the original motion as revised by that one amendment, and we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7484)|
| 2:04:52| the amendment that Ms. Ryder has proposed, the lengthier one with all the yellow highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7492)|
| 2:05:00| Some of the yellow highlights are from the Animal Control Board's amendment, so I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| take credit for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| But that's what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| But do we need to vote on that amendment before we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| So we voted on two different amendments to the amendment, so it's all amended and wrapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| up with a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| If I have questions on something that has nothing to do with amendments, can we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| on the amendment, the final amended-amended amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| And then can I ask some questions about the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| My understanding, and Mr. Johnson can help me here, is that the next thing that Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| would be voting on is your amendment, the broader one that you've been describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7537)|
| 2:05:42| And then as amended, we could vote on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| Right, we get to vote two more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| Yes, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| So is everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| All right, I'm going to call the question on the amendment, amended-amended amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| I don't think you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| I don't think you have to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| There's no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Is there any further question or discussion on Council Member Ryder's amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| The amendment carries 7-0-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| And now we're back to the original motion on the floor as amended twice, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Three times, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Who's counting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Oh, yeah, for the typo, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Mr. Johnson gets to watch this all tomorrow again and do the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| So people send him Christmas presents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| Councilwoman Testerman, or Director Young-Williams Testerman, in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| There were a couple of questions that I received that are not amendments, just questions at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| There are some changes to, like, pet shop retail that were in the ordinance, and I looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| back through the minutes of the Animal Control Board, and I just wanted some explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| on Save the Harvest, I think, was an organization that proposed some amendments to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7616)|
| 2:07:04| people or entities that had had offenses to be able to supply animals to pet retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7624)|
| 2:07:12| And I was just, the questions were about that particular entity and the discussions, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| discussions were at Animal Control Board about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| Because some of the other entities that you work with, like Best Friends and the Humane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| Society, aren't per se in sync with Save the Harvest, if I have that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| So I'm just curious why those language pieces to pet retail sales got put in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7652)|
| 2:07:41| for changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| Well, it wasn't in this, and I may defer to Mr. Gordon to refresh my memory on a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7662)|
| 2:07:51| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| But first of all, there was AKC and Save the Harvest, or whatever the nonprofit is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7672)|
| 2:08:00| did attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| There were some opposition to some of the ordinances that passed earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7682)|
| 2:08:09| But, so that is where they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| I know AKC had some issues with some of the ordinances that were passed earlier this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| so they had shown up to make some of their, and I think we had some housekeeping amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| to that as well, if Mr. Gordon can help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| That said, the board had been working over the course of a couple of years to help establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| because part of Animal Control's responsibility over the years, or can be charged, is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| when they receive complaints, say on a pet retailer, pet groomer, pet kennel, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| like that, and so it's under Animal Control's purview to go to check and follow up on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7729)|
| 2:08:56| complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| The one thing that has not been put in place, and may be coming to this body down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| are some changes to standards and guidelines for those establishments, equivalent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7745)|
| 2:09:13| health department going into a restaurant and looking for codes violations, or making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| sure that they're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| So we were working on ordinances to do the same for those pet retail establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7760)|
| 2:09:29| As far as AKC and Protect the Harvest coming to the meetings, I think they were in relation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7769)|
| 2:09:38| to the ordinances that passed this body earlier in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| Is that not correct, that they had some grievances around some certain changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| And Petland, who was also there regarding the pet retail establishment, who has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| with us on some of those changes, was concurrent with Protect the Harvest in whatever they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7793)|
| 2:09:59| were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Douglas Gordon, City of Knoxville Law Department, staff attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| Yes, Save the Harvest representative Teresa Lucas-McMahan came to the board, and we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7807)|
| 2:10:17| Allison Jackson and Keith Burrows representing Petland, and I'm sure we had other folks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7817)|
| 2:10:25| Those are the ones I can remember, but they had a number of concerns or direct complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7825)|
| 2:10:35| about the ordinances we had passed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| And since this was a complete rewrite of Chapter 5, it is a good time to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7839)|
| 2:10:46| For instance, one of the items that they objected to was the ordinance passed earlier on animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7846)|
| 2:10:57| welfare issues banned the import into Knoxville of any dogs or any animals, I think maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7857)|
| 2:11:05| but really they were talking about dogs, sourced from outside the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7865)|
| 2:11:12| And there's a problem with that, and they pointed out that is a direct violation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| That is straight up not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| Another problem that they pointed out was one part of the ordinance detailed you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7885)|
| 2:11:36| be denied your pet retail establishment permit if you refused an inspection of the pet retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| The problem was, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| When would that inspection occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| And so they pointed out that it really ought to say during normal business hours, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7911)|
| 2:11:59| sometimes we might get some strange person who wants to conduct an inspection at 2 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7919)|
| 2:12:08| Well, you know, no one might be around or available to do that, so that seemed like a reasonable change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7928)|
| 2:12:15| They wanted to point out, Save the Harvest pointed out that the Animal Welfare Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7935)|
| 2:12:27| prohibited any sort of teasing, molesting, harming of an animal, and that all makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7947)|
| 2:12:37| except for the fact that there are some folks who believe that normal veterinary care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7957)|
| 2:12:45| an animal can be harmful to an animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| We have animal rights advocates who span the spectrum, who can take an extreme position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7971)|
| 2:12:59| relative to other folks, and so they believe that perhaps that should be tempered with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7979)|
| 2:13:06| language that said, except for veterinary care, and I believe normal traditional handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7986)|
| 2:13:16| of animals, because we don't want to start going around and arresting doctors of veterinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=7996)|

| 2:13:40| No, I won't ask specifically of Mr. Gordon, but I guess as the chair for Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| Testerman, so the changes about pet stores and who they allowed to supply animals that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8026)|
| 2:13:56| are sold in the pet stores, those changes came from Save the Harvest, but from what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| I can tell from the minutes, you guys, the Animal Control Board voted to move animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| control from the city to Young-Williams, but they didn't vote on these language changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| So those were just, as I read them in the minutes from the different meetings, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| what it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| It was sort of two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Yeah, they're two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| We discussed this transition, this change, voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| They were there to discuss what their proposed revisions are to the ordinances we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| back in January or February, but we did not make any motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| There was confusion on the markup of the documents, so as we left it in one of the last meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8080)|
| 2:14:48| we will review it now that we all have an understanding of whose changes are whose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| and then come back to the board and move forward, and we have yet to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8093)|
| 2:15:00| I'd like to address this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| My job at the city of Knoxville and the law department isn't just to act as a scribe for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| whatever comes my way as any sort of suggestion as to how we should change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| I have to take a look and make sure that what we're going to do is not going to be harmful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8115)|
| 2:15:22| to the city of Knoxville or its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| And so when I saw those suggestions, I realized this was potential, this was liability for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| It's dangerous for the city to have vague language in there and to open up the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| for bad behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| So I've taken the opportunity to limit our liability and tighten up the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8140)|
| 2:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8149)|

| 2:20:38| And then there are two new buildings, each with 21 units in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| They're prototypical buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| They're basically built in the area of the old ball field of Giffin School, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| familiar with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| So these are anywhere from an efficiency to a three-bedroom unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8450)|
| 2:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| I also want to make sure, give you credit for working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| I was at at least ten meetings, and the first one included about 80 people who were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| You were only at ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| Well, those are just the ones you were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| But I think what's important is there were 80 people plus that were really concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| and I think they eventually rallied around the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| But I think one of the things that helped with that is that you established an MOU that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| included preservation of tree canopy, lighting mitigation, environmental protection of Baker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| Creek, and a host of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| So I just think it's very rare that in the middle of a neighborhood we get workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| housing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| And I think I'm grateful for the links you went to meet the neighborhood where they needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8504)|
| 2:21:51| to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| So thank you, and I'm excited for the construction to start when you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| Well, I think one thing I want to say is about the neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| They can be very effective as a body that can negotiate their own neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| their own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8526)|
| 2:22:07| I mean, they actually set the number of parking spaces and things like that and worked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| collaboration with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| We ended up with a bunch of friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8539)|

| 2:22:24| I'd like to commend the Neighborhood Association as well and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| We always like to see these collaborations, and it's a good example of how involving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| neighborhood associations at an early stage can actually make the project better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| And you keep that harmony within the neighborhood, and you get the whim-whim where you get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| housing that doesn't adversely impact on a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| So congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231212?start=8567)|
