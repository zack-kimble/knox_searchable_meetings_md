| 0:12:49| Have you had any contact with them since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| and let them know that we needed to see some progress here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Well, I reached out a couple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| to let them know that they're on this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| in need of an extension that the prior one had expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| but I haven't heard back from Mr. Hibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| And Sergeant Taylor, have they updated their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| They have not, but they will also will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| to do the CAST class again as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Are we more than a year since they've had this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| so they need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| Chair, I'd suggest we wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| we push this to the end of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| and see if they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| And then I'm a little troubled by the length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| this one's been out there and not getting some responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| so hopefully they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Okay, we'll move on to agenda item 6C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| Which is Oscar's food market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=828)|
| 0:14:03| Your name and record, or name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Yes, my name is Barahino Obedi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| and address is 1417 East Magnolia, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| The zip code is 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| Okay, and can you give us an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| on the progress of completing the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| We are waiting for inspections from fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| from the Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| And they have not yet to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| when they will be schedule our appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| but we send all the document that they require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and we are waiting for them to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| when they will come to do an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| Mr. Byrd, what items is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| They're missing health, sales tax registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| At this point, ma'am, it's actually just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| the Department of Agricultural approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| which is the health, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| The health department inspects some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| agricultural inspects others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Okay, sir, do you have contact to follow up with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| to see when they'll schedule that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| I have no contact with them, but I have the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| and we talk through the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Okay. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Would you like a 90-day extension to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| what do you feel like you need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Yes, nine days is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Okay. Nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Any questions, Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Okay, and sir, I just want to make you aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| that if you were to get that completed within that 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| then you would be able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| So I'd like to give an extension of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Would that be the most appropriate thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| or would it be to approve pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| which would be the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| I think for the addendums, we'd just give them an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| because we already, we approved pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| in September, and that time period has run out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| So we're just extending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Okay, so I will make a motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1001)|

| 0:16:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| All right, thank you, and good luck getting in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| and getting that inspection taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| All right, the next agenda item is 6D, PBNG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| PBNG, and Mr. Byrd, do you have an update from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Yes, ma'am, the owner was stuck out of town in Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| and would request respectfully that we extend her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| for 30 days, which time she feels is enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| to pick the permit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| I'll make a motion for a 30-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| to have this come back up at our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| I guess, February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| All right, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| We, 6E has already picked up their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| spaces in the city, is that correct, Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| All right, so we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| 6F, The Hill, do we have anyone here from The Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| If you'll state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| Yes, ma'am, Trevor Hill, 1105 Forest Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Knoxville 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Mr. Hill, could you give us an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Oh, well, obviously we had to get a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| this is actually for a catering beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| and we had to have a couple things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| to get a certificate of occupancy on the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| that's been in use for the last 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| as a bar or restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| So the city has made us jump through some hoops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| and it took a little longer than it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| but hopefully we'll have them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| suffice here in the next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| We've got to pour some concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| and we got a letter from an engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| that should suffice everything else the city needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| once we pour the concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| and it will be done and over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| And hopefully you'll never think about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Mr. Hill and I spoke earlier in the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| and I think you'd probably be done before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| but for good measure, we'll go with 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| That's okay with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| All right, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1141)|
| 0:19:01| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| We hope you don't have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you, I'll have a wonderful afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Okay, next item is 6G Tobacco Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1151)|

| 0:19:42| Yes, ma'am, they have picked their permit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Well, then we don't need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| The two items that we've bumped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| can we go on to 7A before and go back to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1191)|

| 0:20:01| with the Dollar General Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Is there anyone here from Dollar General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1204)|
| 0:20:15| You'll state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| My personal address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| You can give the business if you work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Victoria Hudson, 1612 Elm Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| I don't know if we get anything from Mr. Sergeant Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| or we just, no, because we don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| oh, Mr. Frost, could you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| we haven't done an administrative hearing in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Could I have you touch base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| on what exactly we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Sure, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| In the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Dollar General was cited for two underage sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| within a rolling two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| The first one was February 16th of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| They submitted lately, late a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| And then on December 7th of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| they were cited for a second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| and have since submitted another remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| At this point, it's up to the members of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| to determine if they are satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| with what Dollar General is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| to hopefully fix the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Or if that's the case, then no motion is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| It's just simply accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| On the other hand, if the members of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| are not satisfied with the proposed remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and any actions that Dollar General intends to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| to not have this happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| then there needs to be a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| to refer them to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| where the law department will file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| a non-compliance complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| and there will be a hearing in front of the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| for potential additional fines or potentially suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1334)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Ma'am, a quick question on your remediation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| that was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I did notice that it stated that IDs would be checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| through a POS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Was that in place prior to the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| I'm not aware of the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I just took over the district in August of last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| But the POS system, it's basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I think it's about a year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| When we started our new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Okay, so it was in place when this offense happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| I'm not, I'm not unsure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I don't know the correct date that that was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| Yes, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| I was thinking of the two remedial plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| that you have submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| And the original plan that was submitted by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| not you, but by your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| was to address the first infraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| But then there was another infraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| So it appears that that remedial plan was ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| And I guess my main concern is it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| that the second remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| which is supposed to address that second infraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| is identical, I think, to the first remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| Do you know of any, did I miss something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Is there anything different in the first and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| I was not aware of the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| I don't know what they sent in for the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Well, I don't have a lot of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| in the second remedial plan to address this violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| If it's the same remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| that was in effect the first violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| and it didn't catch that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| and then this remedial plan is in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| to the second violation, but it's the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I don't see how this second remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| is gonna be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| So I will let my colleagues give some thoughts about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| if they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1497)|
| 0:24:57| But that, to me, is a very big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| I'd like to call on Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| about what our options are and details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Well, first, what was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| I looked at the March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| the remedial plan after the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| And at that remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| apparently they did have their point of sale system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| because the fourth point was retraining on POS available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| That was March of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| In the original remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| So from that, it sounds like their point of sale system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| was already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| But Chair, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| the options of the beer board is to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| the second remedial plan and what this lady has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| or to refer them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Council Member Berta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Mr. Frost, if they have another violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| in the next rolling year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| they automatically go to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| If they get three in a rolling two year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| they will automatically go to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| And kind of piggybacking on what Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| So what changes have you implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| or are you gonna implement now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| that you've had these two in the rolling period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| that have brought you to us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| What are the actions that you're gonna take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| to make sure this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| The only actions we have is pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| the CBL is computer-based learning system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| that they take rolling every rolling year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| in towards the POS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I mean, that's, if people make mistakes, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| Now, the POS you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| is that a computer system that it kind of tells you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Yeah, what you do is you scan the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| But the thing about it is, is I train my store managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| that they need to train their people to look at them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| don't trust the computer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| because it can make mistakes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I mean, so basically have that customer interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| You need to make sure that they're asking for the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| and actually reading the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| instead of just swapping it over a scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| and taking that robot advice, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| Have you got plans for additional training sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| or meetings with folks maybe before each shift about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| There's a new store manager in play in this store as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| And there's a whole new crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And the young lady that did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| she was immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| And can you tell us a little bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| what was going on when this last violation occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Was it just somebody who had maybe not had as much training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| or what was the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| She was new to the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| This particular site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| pretty much loses a lot of associates due to turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| So she was fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you for answering my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| I may have missed this, but did the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| did the point of sale system fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| or did the employee just forget to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| She didn't even look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Sergeant Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| I think you just answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Did you say she did not look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| As far as I know, she did not look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Ask Rob to refresh me on if he had a copy of the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1740)|
| 0:29:10| Disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| I think what is really disturbing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| is the fact that a new employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| who's basically just come out of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| and who disregarded everything that it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| you all went over in training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| especially to this particular policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| knowing that you already were on a remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| It just gives me pause to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| how many underage people may have gotten so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| This is just an incident that it was caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And so this is why I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| that it should be taken extremely seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| that this is the second one within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| I kind of think it's unfair that you have to stand here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| and hear this in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I think you stated when you first came up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| that this wasn't on your watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| You're not as familiar with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| And that speaks volumes to me as well from your company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| that they did not send someone here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| that was more intimately familiar with the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| and could speak to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| And so to me, that says that it's not taken as seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| as it should be, whether that's the case truly or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| But I'm just saying based on what we're seeing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| and what we're hearing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| and they don't have the correct representation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| to address this beer board and this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| And I will leave it for further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| from my colleagues before we make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| I actually have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| I'm a little confused and I know you've answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| this question a couple of different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| You have a point of sale system that scans the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| Did the employee not scan the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| I did not watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| I was not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| I did not watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Sergeant Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| I'll say my recollection is that she typed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| the date of birth, but the cadet was 18 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| but she typed in a different date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| She typed in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Do you have any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| on why there's so much staff turnover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Like what factors play into staff turnover at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Or is that for all locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| That's for all locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1906)|
| 0:31:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| What's the rate of pay for this entry level position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| $9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Is that currently what Dollar General's paying is $9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Top out as a sales associate is $12.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| The top out for a sales associate is $12.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| So you got to work your way up to the $12.75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| but you start at $9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I'll be frank with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| I'm surprised you can get anyone to apply at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Because it's competitive market right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| We have, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| How long have you been-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| We've made our voice, our opinion on that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| How long have you been with the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| About two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| So the system doesn't force the employee to scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| They are able to enter it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1964)|
| 0:32:44| Because sometimes the system is down and it cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| And then you'll have to hit the escape button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| and key the birth date on the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| Is there no way for your system to require a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| for that kind of override?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I know it seems like every time I go to the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| something's out of queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| We've got to wait for a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| or somebody else to come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| That isn't on the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| It is on self-checkout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| but it is not on the regular register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| But I'm sure with our technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| they could do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| This location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1999)|
| 0:33:19| and I know a lot of your locations are similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| you're right there next to Western Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| and Beaumont Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| And obviously, hopefully your staff would not sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| to someone from the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| But this is just a lot of children and teenagers and youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| that might be out and about in any of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| There's some locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| you guys have locations scattered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| amongst our residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| where young people can walk and make purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And that's why it's just so pertinent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| that mistakes are not made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| And when we talk to people who come before the billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| for these types of hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| and I think it's unfortunate you weren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| you weren't at the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| you weren't there for the incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| you're not the manager of that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| But people come here and with their remedial plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| we talk about at the beginning of every shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| reminding staff and just constant training triggers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| to make sure this doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| And I realize that you guys aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| doing the same kind of volume as an Applebee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| for alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I hope, maybe not, but it's still important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| And your employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| though they are not paid a great wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| or have the opportunity to make sales to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| which can make life altering differences in people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And that's our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| to make sure that that doesn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| when we're issuing permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and allowing people to continue to sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| it's very important and we take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| And that's what we need everyone to understand every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| when they start their shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Councilwoman Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| All I was gonna say is this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| a very unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| And it is really hard when management puts stuff in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| and then human error or willful disobedience of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| And I appreciate that you terminated the young woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| who did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| And that's about all you could do at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| But it is troubling for all kinds of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| the employee in the first place didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| honor their obligation to the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| to follow their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| And then that maybe there's not enough process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| to remind people of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| We just keep talking around this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| but it sounds to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| I'll make a motion that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| and send it to a hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| and hopefully get something cleared up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| because I think we're just talking in circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| this isn't on your watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| but you're gonna have to clean up the mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And so I hope that this helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Yes, Mr. Frost, someone will be in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Is that what happens at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| And I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| almost everyone has an attorney handle this for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Is that correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So it's usually at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| there's an attorney present quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Just passing that on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| So they-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| I was told do I need one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| They sent you in here alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| but I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I'm passing judgment on your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Second time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Giving you a hot tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Straight out of the gates here, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| We have two agenda items to return to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| before we can adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And we're gonna start with 6B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| to see if anyone has joined us from Fast Hand Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Buehler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Would anybody like to make a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Mr. Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I am very disturbed by the length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| that this has been pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| and the fact that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| a updated fingerprinting and test class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| But I also recognize that we've got still roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| that are in not great condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| And it's certainly possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| that these folks had every intention of being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| and just for some reason weren't able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| What I will suggest is that we take this up in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| And Mr. Byrd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| if you would try to connect with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I will do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| And we'll try to get to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| of what's going on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| and make sure they appear before us in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| I'm just not really comfortable saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| we're gonna let this application go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| when somebody may have been making a best effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| to get here because of the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| So I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| And they're basically saved by the weather on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| honestly, because I'm struggling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| And there may be different opinions out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| But that's what I'm gonna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2348)|
| 0:39:08| I'm gonna say let's give them 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| and we will get in touch with them, Mr. Byrd and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2355)|
| 0:39:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2358)|
| 0:39:18| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| 6G, tobacco shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Tobacco shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2367)|
| 0:39:27| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Going once, going twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| He is, of course, I emailed him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| None of my letters on the new folks have come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| But then again, I don't know how they were delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| last week as it was late in the previous week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| that they went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| He's normally a phone guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Neither of his phone numbers would allow me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| to leave a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| And so other than that, I was left with email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| which went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| But he's not normally an email guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| And I feel that he might be out of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| I'll certainly make an effort to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2410)|

| 0:40:15| a few months ago and talked of leaving the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| And I don't remember what the dates were on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2420)|

| 0:40:26| And for some of the reasons that my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| Councilman Roberto referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| we'd give him the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| And I would move to pass it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| or to the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220123?start=2440)|
